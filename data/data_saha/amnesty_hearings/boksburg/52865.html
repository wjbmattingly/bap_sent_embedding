<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Prinsloo, you were a member of the AWB during the elections of 1994, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When did you join the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Early 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And during 1994, what rank did you have in the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Secretary General of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The Honourable Committee have at various times heard of the generals in staff, can you just tell the Committee if you were part of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you specific tasks within the generals and staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> During the political actions where Mr Terreblanche held speeches throughout the country, I was closely involved in the arrangements of these meetings as well as administrative tasks at head office in Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can I put it to you like this, were you then the secretary of the generals in staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> At the end of 1993 and beginning 1994, were you involved with the AWB's head office in Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was your position there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> My tasks at the head office were to be head of the administrative services, I would also be the liaison officer between the generals in staff and Eugene Terreblanche.  I did the liaison with the media and the public and that included the South African Police Services and the South African Defence Force, as well as political organisations across the world.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Evidence was led in the application, that Mr Prinsloo gave instructions to the applicants in what happened there during that period.  Can you tell us, are you that Mr Prinsloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well tell us then what happened concerning those instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> With respect, we will have to go back before the instructions to the applicants and that is to where Mr Prinsloo received his instructions from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Continue please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>	I would like to take you, if you will allow me, you now explained what your position was and what your task were as a member of the generals in staff.  You attended various meetings with Mr Eugene Terreblanche, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And with the generals in staff, did you also attend meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I attended all meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> There was a meeting in the second half of 1993, on a farm in Ottosdal, do you know about this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I do know about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was it an open or closed meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was a closed meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Where only the generals in staff were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What happened at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairperson, it was discussed in general amongst the generals and visiting Special Forces of the South African Police, of the Defence Force, Medical Corpse, Air Force members, and who addressed this meeting.  The people were brought in to convey certain information to us regarding secession as well as the announcement of an area which would be the Volkstaat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If you talk about secession, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> During that period or in that time certain towns in the country were given to the right-wing or gave the peace to the right-wing ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In other words, they got the freedom of the town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.  Most of these towns were in the Western Transvaal.  There were towns, amongst others, in the Free State as well as two in Natal as well as the current Mpumalanga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we limit the evidence of this witness concerning the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I think the applicant's evidence is concerned with all of these aspects and the reason why they went to the Western Transvaal.  I think it can now be placed in perspective with the people who were involved in it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But they said themselves why they went to the Western Transvaal, but they also testified that they received instructions from a Mr Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I will try and limit but you must allow me to highlight certain aspects because at the end of the day I would like to present the best for the applicants in front of this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>	A map was drawn up, and it was shown in the video, do you have any knowledge of this map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who drew up this map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I personally did it with the help of other administrative personnel in Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you also carry knowledge of a meeting or an order group meeting that was held in a bus in 1994 at ...[indistinct] Spruit Dam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's is correct, the discussion of this map, or we discussed the map there, the borders were drawn up and these borders with the information contained in it came from military information as well as SAP special information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms van der Walt, we accept that they were called to the Western Transvaal, all of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why is that clear enough, is it clear why they went there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, to go and fight in the war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Then I accept it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>	I would like to take you to a meeting at Fyndooringtjies.  Where exactly is this place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It is a nature reserve outside Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And who was present there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was the generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And when was this meeting held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was approximately the Saturday, approximately a week before we all went to the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were any instructions given to you at that specific meeting, and if so, by whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Specific instructions were given, everybody at that stage knew what their tasks were.  Amongst others I was divided into a combat general and every general had his own area.  My area was North East of Ventersdorp which includes Rustenberg, I was on the border of the PWV area.  The Ystergarde was under my command.  I received these instructions from the generals in staff, specifically General Dirk Ackerman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What instruction did you receive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The instruction was to identify a Spes person, give him the instructions to assemble a bomb,  more specifically a motor or a car bomb that they must take or send to the Johannesburg area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was there a specific time that was given to you when this bomb must be detonated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> This bomb had to be detonated on the Sunday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Which Sunday are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is a week after.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Is that then the Sunday before the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Yes, why did it have to go to Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It specifically had to go there because it was the largest area of people who would support the government, ANC supporters, and it was a well-known international city.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> At that meeting, that is the week before when you received these instructions, did they tell you which targets you had to choose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, we had to choose soft targets.  I'd like to rectify something or clarify something.  A perception was created, if it was purposefully or not, that it would purely be a racist attack and it would only be targeted, or the black people would only be targeted.  It was not the case, it was directed against SACP/ANC supporters.  We made a conclusion that the larger support group of the ANC or SACP alliance at that stage was black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why did you choose that target, what was the purpose in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well it was to convince the government to denounce the elections, we wanted to show them that we are serious, that it was not just talk.  De Klerk did not want to listen to us, he ignored us.  After various messages and after I personally was invited to a parliamentary sitting where we wanted to discuss certain matters with him and where Mr Hernus Kriel addressed us, Mr de Klerk never listened to our requests.  After CODESA he didn't leave us any other options.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You said when you received the instructions ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Sorry, very quickly for clarity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>	Mr de Klerk you mentioned, why did he or his party then not become your target?  Just in the context of what you've just said, Mr de Klerk wouldn't talk to you and he ignored your requests, so why didn't you ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> So why didn't you make him and his party your target?  Just help me understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We looked for him but he was in hiding and he was well protected, in that we couldn't get hold of him at that stage.  We did attempt to get hold of him but we couldn't do it.  Attempts were made from the right-wing to get hold of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Yes, but what of his people, his party, his supporters?  By the 24th of April you knew exactly which were the NP areas in the area that you were in charge of, it was easy to find out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> So why didn't you target those particular areas where you knew NP supporters lived, to send a message to their political head that you were unhappy with the way he was treating you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At that stage all National Party offices were in the Western Transvaal and all of them were, bombs were planted at all of these offices, as well as the one in Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> But those were the offices ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why not the ANC offices?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairperson, the ANC offices or at that stage buildings, were not properly positioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> During that time buildings like Khotso House, was that blown up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I hear what you are saying, but the SAP did that before we could.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we do know that.  Shell House was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Obviously yes but you must realise that at that stage these places were well-guarded and it was not part of our planning at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I understand that, I would just like to get things right.  If the targets were people who would vote, and if I understand your evidence correctly, the attack was targeted in order to stop the elections.  Now we all know that the National Party was deeply involved in the elections, they wanted to become the opposition and indeed they did become the opposition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The DP was also deeply involved in the elections, as well as the ANC and the alliance.  I would just like to get things clear, why did you just target the alliance or the supporters of the alliance if we accept that the whole purpose of the attack was to disrupt the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In order to create a fear psychosis in the general public, and that was to target taxi ranks, restaurants, we saw or history taught us that to attack a military base or military personnel or SAP personnel, it does not have the same effect, or it would not have the same outcome with regards to the general public.  If you attack ordinary members of the public, and that the ANC showed us by bombing Wimpy Bars and to look for soft targets, they created a large psychosis of fear amongst the general public members who were mostly white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Prinsloo, what is not quite clear to me is that many of the applicants said that you wanted to prevent the elections taking place, you wanted to disrupt the elections, did you want to disrupt the elections in preventing people from going to vote in large numbers or did you want to disrupt it in order for the government to stop the election as a whole?  I am not quite clear about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was a bit of both. It was to force the government to firstly listen to what the right-wing wants to say, not to listen to what we wanted to say, they at that stage knew definitely what or what our requirements were but at CODESA they ignored it and wiped it off the table.  It was also so that we could not afford to have the elections taking place  ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After the elections a bomb also exploded or was it the day of the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Are you talking about the Worcester matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is another one, I'm talking about the airport bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That was the morning very early, the day of the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's now then too late to stop the elections, we all knew that the elections would continue on the 27th of that day.  Why was a bomb planted at the airport, the previous attempts were not successful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairperson, at that stage it had gone too far.  At that stage there wasn't time to turn around and at the end we still believed that we would be able to achieve something by committing these deeds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then one last aspect on this point, was there any reason why there wasn't a bomb planted in Houghton or Kempton Park or Vanderbijl, or the areas at that stage in which white people lived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, there was no specific town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was in Johannesburg area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was the East Rand, no, West Rand, there was no specific area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, it seems peculiar to me Mr Prinsloo, in that as the previous witness said, the target was directed towards black people and all the bombs were planted in places where it was mostly black people who moved around there, except for the airport bomb.  Can you maybe give some clarity on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> As I discussed it with my legal representatives and what I said earlier on is it was not about people of another colour, we knew that most of the supporters of the ANC/SACP alliance were black people.  There were various incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>	I personally had an agreement within Vereeniging with the Zulu supporters.  We assisted various Indian communities in the prevention of crime, protection of their businesses or buildings in the rural areas.  Amongst others there was a group of coloured people in the Western Cape who approached us and asked us to show them how does the structures of the AWB work, how it is put together.  I personally flew down and helped them with this.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>	They also didn't want to serve under ANC/SACP alliance, they also wanted to create such an organisation.  If they wanted to start a para-military organisation I do not know, I cannot say but they wanted to know how our structure was, how it fitted in.  Many of the Indian communities in Natal, we had close connections with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>	Our business people of other colours, for example in the Western Transvaal, these people were responsible for the, or the provided us with logistics.  So it was not that it was only targeted at black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand that other people worked with you but I'm talking about the planting of the bombs.  It creates the impression that it was specifically targeted at black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You see at that stage I would 99 or 98% of the ANC/SACP alliance was black people, that was their support base and that is where most of the people chose take part in the elections but we wanted to create a psychosis of fear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>	We wanted them to understand that they must not dare to go to the polling booths because it would be too dangerous on the streets, they had to stay away and then the elections would have been disrupted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And those who would have voted for the National Party or the democratic party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well the DP people were safe, they sat in their house in Houghton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why wasn't there a bomb planted there, to stop them from going to the election polls?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well at that stage there were more police deployed in those areas than in the whole of the PWV area, so it would have been senseless for us to go into an area like Sandton.  We didn't have the nice cars, they would immediately have picked us up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Can I just ask one question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>	Mr Prinsloo, what do you say then concerning the evidence of the previous witness, that he specifically said that it was based on a racial, or it was racially based?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I do understand that, I hear what you are saying, but you must realise that many of the members had something against the blacks or people of another colour.  You got your soldiers or the grassroots level people who pertinently would say to you that they will not even think of it, to serve in a new dispensation with blacks and people of other colours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Was this perception fortified by the AWB police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> If I can take the generals in staff, most of us farmed.  Up to the present the farmers work with black people and the blacks in this country know this, a right-wing farmer will look after his people.  The Citizen and the Sowetan also reported this, that black farm workers would never like to go and work in Sandton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> In other words you are saying that the leadership did not enforce this black/white distinction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well at some meetings or some public meetings it was, or the perception was created by Mr Terreblanche, yes it's definitely so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> White we have the intervention, Mrs van der Walt, can I just follow this up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>	You said that you were part of the generals in staff, were you a full member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you just a secretary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I was a full member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you participate in all the discussions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You did not see yourself beneath someone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The other members of the generals in staff were your equal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, except where it comes to the arrangements of the wen kommando, there was a kommandant general who was appointed from the generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But concerning the Ystergarde, did anybody else have a say above you concerning them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, not at all because at that stage I was chosen by the generals in staff to manage that area and the Ystergarde was then appointed to me or placed underneath me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you would only answer to the generals in staff in full meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In closed meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In a full closed meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That was the only place where you would answer to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Not ...[no English translation]?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Not outside the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Maybe the leader?  No, I'm talking about within the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then why did you tell us in the beginning that you received instructions from Cruywagen, specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, General Ackerman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I'm sorry, General Ackerman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How can he give you instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At that stage he was the Kommandant General of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now where does the wen kommando come in then, if you were involved with the Ystergarde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You see the wen kommando was also divided into groups and areas, that is where most of the members of the AWB were.  Then the Special Forces - then there were special members amongst these wen kommando members who would then be taken up in special units, amongst others also the Ystergarde members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The planning and the decisions made concerning the farms, you said it was taken at the generals in staff level.  Why did Commandant General Ackerman, why did he then have to give another instruction after you as the whole generals in staff take this decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We were strictly a para-military and we worked according to military discipline and the giving of instructions and receiving instructions.  It was a discussion that was held a while ago and at that stage, the time when you are talking about now, it was the final discussion of it.  There wasn't specifics that were talked about, it was just to do the final arrangements.  Everybody knew exactly what to do and what their tasks were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>	At that stage I received a specific instruction to convey this to the special unit and to ensure that it is executed and then to get a special force member who could be used for this task.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What I don't understand is why did you receive an instruction again if you said that all the decisions were made by the generals in staff in closed meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You see this instruction was a specific instruction, everybody knew that bombs would be placed and people would be sent all over in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, in Natal and in South Transvaal.  There would be actions all over and every area's commander or combat commander had his own instructions and he knew what was expected from him, he already had his instructions.  There wasn't a specific instruction to go that day and go and plant a bomb in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> All those decisions, to give instructions for specific bombs at specific places right through the country, like you said even the Western Cape, was all of this handled by Dirk Ackerman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, it was handled by the generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did you then receive instructions from Dirk Ackerman?  And the people in the Western Cape, who gave them instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> To do what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> To plant bombs, pipe bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> From their general, that specific general that was in that district.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Kommandant Dirk Ackerman, was he your General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Dirk Ackerman was the Kommandant General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, but he wasn't your general, you were your own general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Of course, but he had a higher rank in the generals in staff than I had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But the other generals or generals in staff, they also had lower ranks than that of Dirk Ackerman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But he did not give them instructions or did he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Maybe he did.  At that stage I was not aware of other instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he have the sole or the last say in what would happen in the broader policy coming from the generals in staff, is that what you're trying to say to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, not at all, he only gave me this specific instruction.  All of us knew what our tasks were and what we had to do.  He only gave me this one specific instruction, of this specific motor bomb or car bomb on this specific Sunday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>	We knew that we would start operating from the Monday and during the weekend people would act in certain areas as well as with me on the game farm.  We would get things in order and they will begin the operations in that week.  My instructions specifically to begin on that Sunday. </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he tell you how the car bomb had to be built?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you discuss this earlier on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, at that stage it was not necessary to discuss things like that in generals in staff meetings.  We knew that we had the knowledge and expertise and the special force members are there and could give the training and could do it.  The people who did the training and the instructions, the South African Police or Defence Force members, we knew that they would come from wherever, the we knew the people were there.  We did not have to tell a specific person to build a car bomb or a pipe bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I'd just like to take you, you said that commanders were appointed to a certain area, can you just explain this?  You said you were also a commander of a certain area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What happened, was there a district divided into certain areas and then a general was appointed to these certain areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> On that specific day at this Fyndooringtjies Culture Festival resort, was the generals in staff together there again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can you still remember who was present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, it was General Kiewiet Roodt, General Cruywagen , the leader, myself, General Japie Oelofse, Dirk Ackerman, his brother, General Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This General Terreblanche, who is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is Mr Terreblanche's brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That is Andries Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.  Then it could be that I left out someone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Then at that stage, did you once again discuss the fact that bombs had to be planted now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, the assurance was once again given that those who had contact with the special forces or unit, that equipment was ready, resources were ready and chaos will definitely now be created from the next week onwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then you were given instructions by Ackerman to within your area begin with the operations on that Sunday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, more specifically I knew that I had to begin with the operations on that weekend, not operate but we had to be in place in our areas or in our place of safety and in this case it was the game farm.  I then also the instruction specifically for the car bomb or I received this from General Ackerman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You also said that you had to get hold of a person who could execute this operation, this special force member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was there any other instructions given with regards to other explosions that had to take place on that specific day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Not specific instructions, everybody knew what it was about</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What did you do after you received this instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I took it through to the game farm and conveyed it to the commanders, and specifically the way in which I received the instructions, I conveyed it in the same manner to the special forces person and that would be Cliff Barnard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why did you choose him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At that stage Cliff Barnard was a confident of the generals in staff as well as Mr Terreblanche, as well as other prominent figures within the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why specifically him, did you know that he would be a suitable person to execute certain operations?  Did you in the past have contact with his expertise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, Cliff Barnard was one of the best trained people in the AWB then.  He received special force training, not just from the AWB but before he became an AWB member.  He received special force training from the Defence Force as well as from the South African Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>	I know for a fact that he was used in the operations of the Germans in the then Windhoek, he brought them through, as well as other operations that he had to execute on behalf of right-wing organisations in the Gauteng area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You said that you also conveyed the instructions to their commanders, who are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The commanders would be the people who were present on the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> With whom did you talk there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We came together in a meeting where members like for example, Brigadier Leon and Johan was present, Abie Fourie and Mr du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was discussed at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We discussed, or I conveyed to the people that they will have to start looking at volunteers who they would have to apply in the certain areas and to create chaos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>	I also mentioned to them that if they would indicate a person, this person had to, will have to be selected by myself and Leon van der Merwe, as well as head office.  The people were not identified at the first meeting, to me or Leon van der Merwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can I just take you back to the instruction that you received, that on the Sunday, that would then be the 24th of April 1994, that a bomb had to go to Johannesburg.  You also said that you identified Cliff Barnard, did you then personally or through someone else give instructions to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I gave him instructions personally and told him that this comes from the generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did he have to complete this task alone or what was your instruction to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well at that stage, I cannot say with certainty, but I did not name any names of whom he had to use, I left it to him to decide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Because evidence was led by Mr Etienne le Roux that he did receive instructions to go to Koesterfontein and to help.  So if I understand your evidence correctly, Mr Barnard had to choose his own people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And what did you tell him, what must the target be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I told him - at that stage he already knew what the target was.  If he was informed by generals in staff, members of it or Mr Terreblanche personally, I do not know, not at that stage.  I know that he had contact with them, he knew exactly what was expected of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Where did he have to go, Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Specifically Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then later on the game farm, or let me just ask you this, you just received instructions that a bomb had to go out to Johannesburg, did you receive any other instructions from the generals in staff to do anything else?  This is now after you received the instruction to take this bomb to Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well on my arrival at the game farm, I requested and gave the instructions that we immediately must get the communication lines up with, amongst others Ottosdal and Schweizer-Reneke and Ottosdal would then relay my message to Schweizer-Reneke, Schweizer-Reneke would then relay a message to Hoopstad area, from Hoopstad they would then relay the message to Brandvlei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why did you want to make contact with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I had to make contact with them on a regular basis to find out where their people are moving. It was necessary for various things, logistical reasons amongst others.  If my people would move through an area, I wanted to know if they could make use of the logistics facilities of for example Hoopstad and then specifically Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you then make contact with Ventersdorp. with the radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I received a message later that they had attempted to make contact with head office but then on the B channel they could then give the message that the people were ready and that we will be able to make contact with them on the B25, which didn't materialise at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you have personal contact, during the time that the people were on the game farm, with Ventersdorp head office?  Did you personally go there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I personally drove through to Ventersdorp.  I left a message the first time that I urgently want to speak with the generals in staff because I cannot communicate with them, my people are cut off and they wanted to go on and what is going on in the other areas and provinces and if they are ready.  I personally drove through to leave a message and the generals in staff came through and came to see me on the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When was this when they came to see you on the game farm?  Was this before the bomb in Johannesburg or after?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was after the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can you then say what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The generals in staff conveyed this, they informed me of what was going on in the rest of the country.  They also said that we cannot stop now, we will have to continue, it is too late to turn around.  There were some of my senior officers present and they can support my evidence in this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> After the Johannesburg bomb exploded, did you receive any other instructions to create any other explosions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, we received instructions that we will urgently have to continue and that it looks good, at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were there specific instructions as to where these explosions had to take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, there weren't specific instructions given as far as I can remember.  There wasn't a specific town or street chosen or isolated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you carry any knowledge or do you know about the pipe bomb meeting that happened or occurred on that Sunday evening before the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I know about that meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was your involvement in this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Are you now talking about the large meeting that was held outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No, I was talking about the closed meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well at the closed meeting we held I conveyed the message that people reported that the bombs were ready and that they were looking for volunteers in order for the explosives to be sent out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were you involved - according to the previous witness there was also talk about the Germiston, do you know about the bomb in the trailer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I was looking for a person, or it was reported to me that a trailer was taken from Ventersdorp for the making of a bomb.  At that stage I did not know whose trailer it was.  Mr Barnard reported to me that he took the "oubaas's" trailer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If you talk about "oubaas", are you talking about Eugene Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.  I said it's not Terreblanche's trailer, it was the AWB's trailer and that he had to go and explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If you now talk about explain, the fact that he took the AWB's trailer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, the fact that he took the AWB's trailer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then, did you then give any instructions concerning the bomb that had to go to Germiston?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I looked for a volunteer - Mr Barnard said he was looking for a vehicle with a towbar, I looked for a volunteer and I then asked Mr Jan de Wet to make his vehicle available.  At that stage he did not know what it was for.  I said it was a mission that he had to go and complete, he had to drive through to Koesterfontein to a person, Koper Myburgh and that it was his farm and then he will receive further instructions there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This discussion that took place, where did it take place, because according to the previous witness there was a meeting held outside on the game farm?  This discussion concerning the Germiston bomb and the instruction that you gave, where did this take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That took place in the hall itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> In the open meeting or in another room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I cannot say with certainty if it was during the open meeting, there were various people coming and going and arrangements were made, commanders shouted their orders.  I only gave the specific person the instructions and it was not far from where I slept.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Evidence exists that people then moved from the game farm to the shooting range close to Rustenburg.  Do you know of a bomb that went to Jan Smuts Airport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you have anything to do with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, the instruction would then be to focus the attention more or to get attention from foreign countries and the international community and that a place like the Johannesburg Airport had to serve for this purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> From whom did this instruction come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It came from the generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When did you receive this instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It would have been the evening when the members of the generals in staff visited me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> On the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, on the game farm.  It would have been that morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>	Mr Prinsloo, your answer to an earlier question was that you received instructions from staff, that would be after the generals in staff had come through and saw you.  "They told me that I should continue, that it was too late to turn back.  There were members of the senior officers who were present and who can confirm this".</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>	Then on a further question you said that you received the orders from staff, in other words they said it looked good but they didn't isolate a town or a street in which bombs would be planted.  If I understand you correctly, you say the instruction ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct, because they knew what my area was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you've said that this order had specifically to do with Jan Smuts Airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> This one specifically, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was that on the same evening, on the same occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was during that time period, that morning that it was mentioned to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why didn't you tell us this when you were talking about the generals in staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The generals in staff were at least there for 12 hours ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, the other evidence ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> They arrived there in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, and they left early in the morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> They came in the night and they left early in the morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you spoke to them, they looked at everything, they told you it looks good, go ahead, you can't turn back, but they didn't give you any instructions regarding towns and places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, they didn't tell me specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then they left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> They didn't say specifically to send a vehicle to Germiston or Springs or whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But your evidence now has been that they told you to send a vehicle to Jan Smuts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well in consultation we made a joint decision.  They said that it was necessary to create an international event or incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Mr Prinsloo, you know you've just helped me a little bit with your last sentence: "in consultation" you did whatever, because you've been saying you received, I understood you to be saying you received instructions from the generals in staff to do this, do that, when they visited you at the game farm.  Are you with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>	Now earlier on you testified that you were a member of the generals in staff, of equal standing  with any other member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> When the first decision was taken to bomb at Bree Street in Johannesburg, let's call it Johannesburg, I have understood you to say the generals in staff, all of you would then have talked about it but the specific instruction came to you from General Ackerman, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> So your "in consultation" starts from the very first incident?  You were consulted as a member of the generals in staff but the specific instruction came from one particular person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that's correct as you've put it, it came from one specific person.  But you must understand that in all cases everything would be discussed before a general would plan an action or execute an action, there would be consultation first.  One person could not do as he wished or carry out an operation, or not carry out an operation but assign operations and have them executed, without consulting or making aware the rest of the staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> I'm happy with that.  Now when you got the second instruction, how many of you made that decision?  This "in consultation" at the game farm, how many of you were there, generals in staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> About four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> I counted three, is it four?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Ja, about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Four, including yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Were you quorate, did you have a quorum?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That quorum didn't matter at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> How many would you normally be if all of you were in consultation as the generals in staff, how many would you normally have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> If there were seven members in the staff, then at least four or five had to be present in order to have a quorum but at that stage ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The question is, what was the total number of generals who were members of the generals in staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who visited me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, normally.  How members were in the generals and staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Approximately 13 to 14 persons but that would include those persons who were in command of culture or whatever, it wasn't always persons who were combat generals or had to do with the administration of the wen kommando.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Now really, I am just curious, could four generals, irrespective of their areas of expertise, were you authorised by your organisation to take decisions of this nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, the decision had already been made.  I just had them come in as a result of the fact that I didn't have any communication with Ventersdorp.  I left a message with Ventersdorp that these persons should contact me urgently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> So the last few decisions were taken in your absence and this information was communicated to you by the visiting general at the game farm, is this what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> This is where you've lost me.  You see because I understand you to operate as a team but at the same time you talk about people visiting you to approve of what you're doing and then to go beyond Bree Street to other areas of operation which you not discussed before you had come to the game farm.  This is why I'm just asking you to help me understand your role and  your authority to say to your men: "Continue, go to Germiston, go to the other ...[indistinct] areas, Benoni, Krugersdorp and then go to Jan Smuts Airport".  Where did that authority come from?  That is really my problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You see these persons were delegated through Ventersdorp, to come and see me.  Regarding the arrangements and who would have made these arrangements, I wouldn't know.  Who would have delegated them is unknown to me.  Who would have taken the decision that these individuals came to see is beyond my recollection.  I don't who would have sent them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But didn't you leave the message for them to see you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, but the staff was large.  I didn't say only those specific persons were to come and see me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you want the entire generals and staff there with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I wanted members of them there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And if they hadn't come, would you have been able to make that decision yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Then I would have sent somebody through but I had to communicate with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If I understand your evidence correctly, you testified earlier that the decision had been made with generals in staff that explosions would take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And when you testified regarding the fact that they didn't give you any specific towns, did that have to do with the pipe bombs or which bombs are you referring to here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That included the pipe bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you say that on the following morning a discussion was held and a decision was made that the following bomb would be at Jan Smuts Airport, was that the following morning?  I'm just trying to rectify this.  We've got the Sunday evening, the Sunday was the 24th, the election took place on the 27th, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Now this discussion with regard to, and this is in terms of a question asked by the Honourable Chairperson, when did this discussion take place, was that after the Monday morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That would have been early on that Monday morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then you conveyed this order to Barnard and the others, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Where did you convey the order that a bomb should go to Jan Smuts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It would have been on the game farm before we left for the shooting range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you have already testified that this was in order to elicit international attention, the bomb explosion at Jan Smuts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And when you discussed the bomb with Barnard, the Jan Smuts bomb, who were all present during that discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> A person by the name of Koper Myburgh.  I'm speaking under correction but I'm almost certain that the manager or the driver of the vehicle was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I can't remember the name of that person.  I think his brother was also arrested along with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you give any orders with regard to in what this bomb was to be built?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There was a vehicle, a Peugeot if I remember correctly, on the game farm which would have been used for this purpose.  I saw the vehicle and decided that it could not be used for these purposes because it was in such a bad condition that any person would be able to see or suspect that something was amiss.  I gave instructions for the vehicle to be repaired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was this the Peugeot which was, according to earlier evidence before the Committee, a stolen vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And according to the applicant, Mr le Roux, he himself repaired the vehicle with parts from his own possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know where that bomb would be placed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In whose hands would that decision have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It works like this, anywhere in a military situation the order could be give for such a bomb to be planted and for such an order to be executed but the circumstances prevailing during his action would imply that he would have to use his discretion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And is that what happened ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It could be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't give a specific instruction for this bomb to be placed in Bree Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No.  The Johannesburg bomb, are you referring - I'm referring to the Airport incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no, we're talking about the Bree Street bomb.  Is that also a case of them having used their discretion and placing the bomb in Bree Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Not really because they had the instruction that it was supposed to be in a busy place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I understand that but you didn't receive an order to place the bomb in front of a specific building specifically in Bree Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, that would have been according to the discretion of the driver himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the same of application in other cases?  Did you tell them to go and place the bomb near a taxi rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The person who would have been driving the vehicle or who would have been responsible for the order or for the execution thereof, knew specifically that they had to select a taxi rank.  My instruction initially was never to use a person who didn't know the area very well, it's best to use a person who comes from that area or works there at least.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And now with regard to the Johannesburg Airport bomb, I understand your evidence that after - that's the former case, it was said that the bomb should be placed at the airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the pipe bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At the various towns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Was it ever said which town should be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I'm speaking under correction regarding which town it was, but at a certain stage it was said to people or said to the volunteers to which town they should go.  I wouldn't say in all cases but in some of the cases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And in some of the cases they had to use their own discretion.  In the case where it would be said: "Go to Pretoria" for example, would it be said where in Pretoria the pipe bomb should be placed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It could be that a commander could issue such a command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You gave the order that pipe bombs should go to a specific area, although you didn't mention any specific towns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct, in the PWV area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> In the PWV area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Among others therefore then Pretoria and Johannesburg and the East Rand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you know who carried out the orders out further after you had issued them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Johan and the other commanders who were present on the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When you speak of Johan, who do you refer to, Johan Smit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Evidence was given by Mr du Plessis, Johan du Plessis that he called the people aside and gave them orders to go to specific towns, do you know anything about the orders which were received?  Was he present during the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He was there at the meeting of commanders so he would have received the same order and he would have conveyed it as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you still have quite a number of questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> There is a video that I would like to show.  Did you wish to conclude matters today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we are going to finish.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> There is a video which I would like to refer to but I would need to find the specific places on the cassette because it's quite a long speech which was delivered by Eugene Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No, no, I just wanted to mark the specific aspects of the tape which I wish to highlight.  I've consulted the technical team this morning and if I could have the opportunity to mark the specific points of interest on the video then it would facilitate matters because it's necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you going to lead the witness on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I am going to lead him because he was at the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you not question him regarding that now and then we could watch the video later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That would be rather problematic because then I would have to ask leading questions.  I would prefer that he have the opportunity to see the video himself.  I have personally watched the video, I know what is contained in it but I prefer that things be heard the way that Mr Terreblanche would have said them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will adjourn for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">NICOLAS MARTHINUS PRINSLOO:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms van der Walt, are you ready or do we need to make other arrangements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I cannot point out all the relevant aspects to the Committee right now because it is a video cassette of three hours long and it was suggested to me that I lead the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me just establish, are there any members of the legal representation who would object to the evidence being led according to this plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, there is no objection from me as Evidence Leader.  I have had a brief discussion with my learned friend and it doesn't appear that there would be any objection as long as the video be made available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well whoever wishes to watch the video after hours is free to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Then I would like to submit the video as an exhibit because I feel, with respect, and I understand your point, that there is quite a lot of work on your hands, but there are also applicants whose lives are in my hands and I must also do my job properly.  So I would prefer that the video be submitted as an exhibit so that the Committee in their own time can look at the aspects to which I have referred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I will also like to place the following on record.  I obtained these videos at a very late stage.  I did this with a single point which I which to prove to the Committee regarding exactly what happened and what the leader of the AWB would have said.  I wanted to use the video if he wanted to clear his name as he made known in the press.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will that be Exhibit 1?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Please, thank you very much.  Then I will lead it as follows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is the video?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> It is in the video machine.  It is an original video.  I didn't have one made because I didn't have the time but I will submit it as an exhibit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Those who wish to view it can approach me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This was the video which I wish to refer you to and discuss with you.  It was a video of the "Volks Kongres" which took place on 9 October 1993 in Klerksdorp.  Were you present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And is it correct that there was a parade which involved thousands of prepared soldiers in uniform and this took place in the streets of Klerksdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And during this meeting Ferdie Hartzenberg addressed the meeting first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And after that the leader, Eugene Terreblanche addressed the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And that which does not appear on the video, it appears that Constand Viljoen would have addressed the meeting at a later stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> After Terreblanche had addressed the meeting -  rather let me put it this way, during his address, he also mentioned that he and some of his members of staff had had the opportunity to visit the military installation as well as the airforce and the navy, were you present during these visits to these various institutions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That would be the South African Airforce.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct, I was present during all these inspections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And what did these inspections involve?  Did they show how all these institutions operated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Furthermore, during the meeting Terreblanche said that he would never negotiate, that he would only negotiate over the barrel of a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> After his address which took quite some time, certain resolutions were proposed to the meeting and that was undertaken by General Cruywagen and all the generals were present, the generals in staff along with all the members who were at the Volks Kongress, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then certain resolution were accepted by the members of the AWB and of course by the generals in staff and you had to place this on the minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> There was one specific point which was made there and that was that Terreblanche said that on the 29th of May 1993, he gave the government and CODESA six months time to grant a Volkstaat or else "We",</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>that would be the AWB, </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>"would take other steps".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>Furthermore he said that that time had expired on the 29th of November 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> He further said that after that, after that expiry date the AWB would accept no responsibility in preventing people from using means which would lead to them ensuring their freedom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Furthermore, he also said that he wished to send a warning to the CODESA Government, he referred to it as that, the CODESA Government</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>"The government of the ANC who did not grant us a free republic, we will then fight throughout the entire South Africa and win the entire South Africa, and we will pursue them until they homelands and then the whole South Africa will be ours"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Furthermore, he said that if we had to fight then it would be foolish ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did he say this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> During the meeting at that stage.  He further said: "If we have to fight it would be foolish to pay too great a price for such a small piece of land.  They'll fight with us for the entire South Africa".</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>MS VAN DER WALT</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>"We will pay with lives, it's war.  The thing has broadened into a war in which we will fight and a war which we will win"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That was also discussed during the meeting.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>"We want a free state.  The volk will determine the boundaries, and the wars will determine the boundaries as well"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Of further interest here is that the negotiations in Kempton Park are entirely rejected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Those were the important points, and that is the cassette which has the three hours worth of speech on it.  Thank you, nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS VAN DER WALT</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Adv Prinsloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>	Mr Prinsloo, the specific map upon which the Volkstaat was drawn by you, as you testified, and in this very same 2nd of April occasion it was indicated that there would be an area which was to be protected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRINSLOO:</span> Would that be the area which the AWB would claim or what area is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was an area which we didn't have to take with violence because as I have testified earlier this was an area where the majority of towns had already been given over to the right-wingers by the granting of the freedom of the town, among others to the organisation.  Not only to the AWB but also to the CP and at that stage the Volksfront.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>	These municipalities or these town councils which were then handed over as such comprised a committee called Wesbou which included city councillors, city secretaries, financial persons, people from the traffic departments, people who were in command of the civil protection services and so forth, and also members of a local army kommando.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRINSLOO:</span> Would the AWB have prevented any attempt to take back that area of land from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, we would have prevented it and we would have protected these towns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRINSLOO:</span> Members of the AWB who at that stage had gathered together, do you have knowledge thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I do.  There were approximately 1500 people, members of the wen kommando at Koester.  These persons at a certain stage bought the property or the premises where they lived.  Furthermore, throughout this entire area in which we had made the announcement, which is stipulated by the map and the borders, throughout this entire area there were people from throughout the country who had gathered there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV PRINSLOO</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr van Zyl?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN ZYL:</span> There are just singular aspects which I wish to clear up, with regard to certain problems with the testimony of the former witness, and with regard to specific persons against which the AWB aimed their offences.  The previous witness did mention that it was aimed at black people.  	You have created a broader picture and more specifically that it was not only aimed at black people but also members of the ANC/SACP alliance.  Was there, in the run-up to the elections, any clarification made by the commanders of the AWB that the violence would be aimed at people who were apparently white?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We all realised this, we all knew that whites would also be among the ANC supporters.  We knew that there were white people who were members of the South African Communist Party, for example.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> What about right-wing supporters, did the AWB and their commanders foresee that there would be a possibility of white right-wingers who could be injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We did foresee this and that would formed part of the sacrifice which they would have to make, if such a person was injured by an explosion or by any such action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>	One can return and say that those person who had received orders to perform acts from their various areas or under their area commanders, those persons were at a stage so intensely prepared that they wouldn't have hesitated to injure themselves or to lose their lives in the process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> But you would agree with me that the violence was not purposely aimed at right-wing white persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Absolutely not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> However the possibility existed that some of these people could very well be injured, people within your own ranks or people from other right-wing parties or organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> But you would also agree with me with regard to the evidence, on your own version, that the violence was mainly directed towards non-white people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct, because the non-whites one could find the most support for the ANC and the SACP alliance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> You gave evidence that you were part of the generals in staff, what was your specific role with regard to decision-making in that set-up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> My role within generals and staff essentially changed when purposeful actions were planned and when the decision was to made to go over to warfare completely.  That is when my role changed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In what respect did it change?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In the past where I would only have liaised or served as a liaison officer between the generals and the political spokespeople, my role changed to that of combat general.  In the past I had to achieve the agreements between the SAP during public marches or AWB marches or right-wing marches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>	It changed to the effect that other people were appointed to carry out those tasks and I served purely as a combat general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Effectively you participated in the decision-making process?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Could you provide the Committee with an example of when you would have made your own decision or a decision which was made by you which would have been accepted by the generals in staff due to the fact that you would have had knowledge of that specific matter?  In other words, which decisions would you have made according to your discretion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And be accepted by the staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Among others, at a certain stage legislation was passed or submitted which maintained that any person participating in a public action would have been prevented by this legislation to carry his weapon in public.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>	I would have proposed that this be accepted and that if such a person not observe this regulation, that this person would be expelled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> You would agree with me that some of the decisions taken by you would have been accepted by the rest of the generals in staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well a proposal, not a decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Would you agree with me then that certain decisions that you took was accepted by the generals in staff without any further communication between you?  Let's take for example the decision which you have just described to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> In other words there is a certain measure of discretion which you held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Before we went over to this purposeful action, during this period of time, the week or two preceding, I or no other member of general could simply take a decision and then consult with the staff after the fact.  It was essential that all decisions enjoyed the approval of the generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Very well, let us just briefly look at the situation surrounding the discretion which was left to certain members of the AWB.  In your evidence in chief you testified that with regard to an order which you gave to Clifton Barnard, he was to apply his own discretion and you left it up to him, with regard to the execution of his duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>	At a later stage you also testified, when you gave evidence regarding the Peugeot and the bomb which was supposed to be planted in that vehicle, you mentioned that the person who was to drive the vehicle would have to use his own discretion with regard to the specific placing of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>	My entire argument is that according to your own version a lot of mention was made about discretion and in my opinion much was left up to the specific member's discretion.  Would you agree with me that certain decisions were in fact left to their discretion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But you must understand what I mean by that.  You are dealing with highly trained military personnel or members.  It wasn't always necessary at that stage to indicate a purposeful or specific destination in a town or in an area or in a residential area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>	That person would have to use his own discretion.  If it wasn't safe to enter such an area, he would have to realise himself that it would be preferable to carry this out in another area or in another town, not in that specific street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> That said in one breath but in another breach would you agree with me, and you also testified as such, that the hierarchy indeed was a para-military hierarchy which was similar to a military set-up and that certain rank orders of instruction had to be observed.  And isn't it true that in such a military hierarchy express instructions are given to members, isn't that how it would operate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Mr van Zyl, that is if you are dealing with the regular step, rules and regulations in the regular military body.  Are you attempting to apply that to this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> My question deals with the fact that in the one breath the witness has testified that there was a certain measure of discretion which was left over and that is basically a statement which I'm putting to him.  I'm asking why can it be like that if, according to his own version, he testified that there was a certain rank order of command which had to be strictly observed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is your case then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> My case is exactly that, that a certain measure of discretion was left to the witness to make certain decisions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But he has said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Indeed.  The rest of my questioning will then make it clearer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>	You testified further that with specific relation to the bomb attacks you received instructions from Ackerman, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> To what extent did Ackerman take those decisions, was that in consultation with the rest of the staff or did he in his turn receive his instructions from someone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, not at all, in consultation with the staff.  He could not take a decision by himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> And were such decisions with regard to the planting of bombs, taken at a meeting during which you were present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Did that order come from someone specific and if so, who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Specifically which explosion or task or order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Let us take the general instructions with regard to the planting of bombs in the former PWV area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I don't understand what you mean.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> My question is whether Mr Ackerman received his instructions specifically at that meeting from someone higher than him, and if so, what the instruction was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well that was in consultation, in co-operation with the entire staff that the decision was made to plant the bombs.  He had no instructions from a higher authority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> And you testified that you received instructions from Ackerman himself, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that's correct.  You could call it an instruction but it was more specifically highlighted to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> And was it highlighted to you during that meeting or after the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Which meeting are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> The one at Fyndooringtjies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was highlighted to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> During the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> So you received express instructions during the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> You testified with regard to the Jan Smuts bomb, that you were present on the farm.  Before then you testified that you were struggling to establish communications with head office and that there were certain aspects which you wanted to discuss with some of the other generals, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> At which stage, if you could just inform me once more, were you told that a bomb was to be planted at Jan Smuts Airport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well that must have been during the morning, but I can't give you an exact time.  However it did take place during the visit made by the staff from Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Very well.  And who specifically gave you the order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There were at least three members present who I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> That being?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> General Kiewiet Roodt, among others, General Cruywagen.  I can't say with certainly whether General Ackerman was present.  I would be lying if I were to tell you specifically who was there, I can't recall exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> In your evidence in chief you testified that the generals came to you and told you that everything was in order and that you should.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Why didn't you mention at that specific stage that you had received instructions to go ahead with the planting of a bomb at Jan Smuts Airport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You must remember that at that stage we were talking about the previous evening, what led to it, why these people came to see me.  They visited me with a specific reason because it was a priority with us  to set up communications with the other areas in the country and I wanted to clear that up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Very well, but you will agree with me that it was also a priority to receive instructions with regard to the planting of those bombs, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> If the persons had not come through to the game farm I would have gone to find out what was going for what.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> You testified that your instructions were to the effect that you should create an international incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Were those the specific words in which you were told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I wouldn't say that those were the specific words but it boiled down to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> But what were the specific words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But he's just said that he can't remember.  He says according to what he can remember it boiled down to the fact that they wanted to create an international incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> So therefore you can't remember the specific words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I can't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Would you agree with me that the international media during that period was primarily aimed at South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, to a certain extent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> And would you also agree with me that the bombs which exploded at the Jan Smuts Airport would also have attracted the international media to South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, but you must understand that at that stage there were members, thousands of members of the international media in South Africa and they were entering the country on a daily basis at that stage, via Jan Smuts and DF Malan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Yes, but would you ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon Mr van Zyl, sorry for the interruption, but I find it very difficult to see what you're getting at with your questioning.  Couldn't you just expedite your procedure to your eventual point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> My last question will be that, and I'm putting this to you, that it was unnecessary to plant a bomb at Johannesburg International Airport in order to create an international incident there, the media's eyes were already focused on South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>	In the light of the fact that your targets were specifically aimed at pertinently or primarily black taxi ranks, the Johannesburg or Jan Smuts Airport bomb incident was completely beyond the relevance of the modus operandi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> ...[no English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Was there any discretion left to you with regard to where the bomb had to be planted at Johannesburg International?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any other questions Mr van Zyl?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Just a few more questions, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought you said those were your last questions, that was two questions ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Yes, my last question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>	What is your feeling towards the victims of the bomb incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I would say my sympathy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Could you repeat please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> My deepest sympathy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> If you came face to face with one of them and communicate with them, what would you tell them or say to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I would say exactly the same as what I have just said to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well my friend it depends on how the conversation will go from then on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> Are you still a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I'm not a member of the AWB anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sir, I the question was directed to find out if you are willing, after everything that happened and for which the AWB is responsible, to clear your heart and conscience and to make peace with the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I've got no problems with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN ZYL</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got any questions Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well you can ask it at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.	I want to ask the prison officials to see to it that those applicants who are in custody be brought to this hall in time so that we can start at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.  We'll adjourn till 9 o'clock tomorrow.</p>
