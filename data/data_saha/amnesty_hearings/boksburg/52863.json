I know that you are aware of what you need to convince me in order for me to believe your evidence that Mr Terreblanche has to accept responsibility on behalf of the AWB, the entire history and all the exhibits also points to a different pattern. It points to a series of bomb explosions - whether these be explosions during which people are killed, injured or maimed or at industrial places, offices and other such buildings and then we have the political speeches of Mr Terreblanche in which he makes direct or indirect threats and he says: \"If there is no Volkstaat (and I am referring specifically to exhibit c) then this pattern will continue.\" Exhibit f, sorry. In the last paragraph of that exhibit there is a short article and in that he says: \"All hell will break  loose,\" and not he or Dr Hartenzenberg will be able to prevent it. In other words the policy was to achieve actual distance from that which was happening while the entire perception was that the right-wingers were actually the ones who were busy with it and your evidence now that you want the AWB to stand up like a man and be counted - if you will excuse my archaic language, is evidence which I cannot believe. The AWB did not want to stand up like a man and directly accept the responsibility for their actions. They did not even want to in an anonymous or indirect fashion tell the media that the AWB was responsible for these actions. It just wasn't their style.  Actually the AWB was a bunch of sissies who could not accept responsibility for their deeds and their policy. What is your commentary regarding that?",

By their own admission they were prepared to put this country to flames with callous disregard for human life.  On the 24th April 1994 in Bree Street they murdered our only child, Susan Ann Keane who was in the prime of her life and had made the most of the privileges this country had given her which unfortunately so obviously others had wasted.  She had a B.Soc. Science degree, a higher diploma in Third World Development and Planning and a masters degree in Town Planning.  She had so much to offer her beloved South Africa.  Susan worked tirelessly in pursuit of justice and democracy for all and extended her hand of friendship to everyone regardless of race or religion.  Her warmth and kindness touched many lives.  We thank God for giving us such a wonderful and caring daughter and we return her to Him with love.  May she rest in peace knowing that she has made her contribution to the land God gave all South Africans to cherish and preserve.  Our deepest regret is that we never had time to say goodbye.  Although we tried to help others in Susan's memory, our lives have deteriorated to a mere existence and now in our retirement years we have to face a future of loneliness without her to comfort or care for us.  The atrocities they committed have caused untold misery and tragedy for the families who lost their loved ones and who are not able to be here to speak for themselves.  Their breadwinners, the children and for those who are maimed and injured, you had no right in the name of God to decide whose lives were expendable.  We actually pity you for having to beg for amnesty and live the rest of your lives with these deplorable deeds on your conscience as at the end, you will have to meet your Maker whose commandment was thou shalt not kill.  As self professed christians and adults, the final decision was yours and you chose to commit a barbaric criminal act, the murder of one human being by another.  Your attempts to equate your heinous act with other political acts is preposterous.  You had freedom and the vote which these people were denied during the 40 years of apartheid rule.  You knew you were free to negotiate right up to the last moment.  At this point I would like to say to you and I will look at you while I say this - love your children with all your heart and all your soul because God forbid they would be taken from you by murderers like yourselves.\n\tFinally, if you were sincere in offering your sympathy, this Commission would not have had to ask if you were remorseful.  You were unmoved, you would have offered it of your own free will long before now.  God bless all the victims and comfort them.  God bless the new South Africa and it's leaders.  Thank you.",

I consider the Commission had a mandate to extract the whole truth and will fail in it's duty if he is not called.  I'm not entirely satisfied with the investigation and totally disillusioned that they failed to uplift Koekemoer's report back file which seems to me to be of the utmost importance and highly relevant to these proceedings.  \n\tFurthermore, they failed to point out that there were two policemen present who co-operated with the accused.  With regard to the Bree Street bomb, police complicity was apparent to many witnesses and having been informed that the car contained a bomb they failed in their duty to issue a warning while smoke was pouring from the car.  According to three newspaper reports, the police stopped a car with three blacks in it and spread-eagled them on the road and released them moments before the bomb exploded.

It was on record - he had not applied for amnesty, he was informed, as I understand, as an implicated person.  He chose not to appear at these proceedings.  The question of him or his activities in so far as his information to the police is concerned was raised by the applicants.

The fact that Koekemoer may have been in complicity with the police or the police in complicity with Koekemoer would not have taken the applications any further.\n\tFurthermore, I understood from the witness protection department of the TRC, Advocate McAdam, that Koekemoer had been relocated in terms of a justice witness programme, he received a new identity and there was also a very strong possibility that he was either assisting the Attorney General in other prosecutions and for that reason the Attorney General was not prepared in terms of Section, I think, 31 of the Act to allow or permit Koekemoer to give evidence, in other words to his prejudice.  That situation being the case, the likelihood that Koekemoer's legal representative would have then consented to him to have given evidence was regarded and viewed as being remote and all those facts taken together, I was satisfied that the matter not be pursued and for that reason Koekemoer - I did not insist that Koekemoer be brought.

It is customary for us to be favoured with argument by representatives before we do so.  It seems appropriate in this matter to allow the legal representatives, because it has been a longish hearing, until next Wednesday - what will be the date?  23rd of this month, September, to submit any heads of argument if they wish to do so to our head office in Cape Town.  In dealing with the issues the panel is particularly interested in the following and we ask all parties who choose to submit heads to deal with it\n\t  To whatever extent the question of racism is relevant, whether the policy of the AWB was objectively racist or subjectively racist and how we should approach the matter.   To whatever extent the question of racism is relevant - whether the policy of the AWB was objectively racist or subjectively racist and how should we approach the matter.\n\tSecondly whether whatever was committed was committed by a splinter group or whether it was committed by the AWB through it's various military organs.  \n\tIn each of the two issues, we would like the matter to be dealt with applicant by applicant.  If in the event of us finding that it was a racist activity, how would that fact impact of the applications in itself?  \n\tNext - whether generally the applications complied with the act.  We wish you also to deal with the matter of credibility of each applicant and witness for the purpose of this application I don't think we include victims.  We don't need the victims evidence to be dealt with.\n\tAnd lastly, we wish you to deal - no not lastly - the aspect of proportionality, that is a factor that is included in the Act and lastly, to what extent the rank of each of the applicants is relevant.  That's all.\n\tBefore I close this hearing, I wish to express our gratitude to all those who arranged for this hearing and all that goes with arranging the hearing, for the work of the security officials and also the interpreters.  I know the last two days they've input and stretched, I thank them for their work.  I thank also all the representatives for the patience and the way they conducted the hearing and in particular I wish to thank those victims or suffered or sustained injuries or suffered the loss of family members.  It must be an extremely difficult time to have to experience those events all over again and I am not in a position from where I sit to comfort you, neither am I in a position to say to you forgive and forget but within the context of this whole process and I think I speak on behalf of the Commission, one can only hope that the hurt and the emotional distress that you as victims experience will diminish with time and that one can only hope also that you come to terms with life in South Africa despite those grave losses.
