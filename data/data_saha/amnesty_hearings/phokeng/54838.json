            "Both the applicants in this matter are members of the Baphokeng tribe.  Boy Diali was born in 1961 and Christopher Mokgatle was born in 1943.  They came into this world as rightless citizens of South Africa and who from 1977 became rightless citizens of the independent homeland of Bophuthatswana.  Following the events of December 1990, those events which give rise to this application, they were arrested, they were detained, they were tried, convicted and sentenced as Bophuthatswana citizens and they were sent to Odie district prison to serve their sentences.\n\tOn the 1st of January 1994 through the promulgation of the Restoration of Extension of Citizenship Act, all residents of Bophuthatswana, including the then President Lucas Mangope, Boy Diali and Christopher Mokgatle, the two applicants, attained South African citizenship.  It is therefore as South African citizens that the two applicants now apply to this Commission.\n\tIn setting the context and the background to the events, leading up to December 1990, we would start in 1977 in Bophuthatswana.\n\tIt was on December the 6th of that year that Bophuthatswana took independence from South Africa and from its birth to its gracious demise in April 1994 it was ruled by Chief Lucas Mangope and his Bophuthatswana National Party.\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n4\n\tBophuthatswana was governed by a legislative assembly\nwith 99 members.  48 of these members were designated by chiefs and headmen.  In addition to this weighing, the constitution of Bophuthatswana allowed for the retention of tribal customs and more importantly, for the full and unaltered retention of tribal authorities.  These tribal authorities held extensive powers, encompassing the management of tribal affairs and the giving of advice to the Bophuthatswana Government on local affairs.  Within this they held far-ranging powers, including powers of arrest, sentencing, the levying of taxes and the prohibition of unlawful gatherings. \n\tGiven the extent of these powers, it is not surprising that President Mangope embarked on a systematic replacement of legitimate chiefs with those who would support and maintain his peculiar system of governance.  The 18-year history of this fragmented make-believe nation is littered with names which have become synonymous with repression and oppression in our country.  Winterveld, Leeufontein, Braklaagte, Thahung and Phokeng - which is the subject of this application. It is a history of forced removals, of non-Tswana citizens, a history of corruption, banning of organisations, political imprisonment, deportations, police brutality, torture, hangings, impoverishment and degradation.  It is a history strangely enough, of a homeland with a bill of rights, albeit a bill of rights with a difference.  It contained within the preamble of the constitution, words which differ considerably from the present South African Constitution.  The final clause of the Bophuthatswana constitution read as follows:\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n6\n\"The rights and freedoms defined in sections 9 to 17 ...\"\nnd those were the fundamental rights -\n\" ... may be restricted only by a law of Parliament and such law shall have general application.\"\nThe bill of rights therefore, was superseded with relative ease by the Internal Security Act and other pieces of repressive legislation and was in fact, unenforceable in the Bophuthatswana courts.  \n\tIt is a history presided over, and determined by the self-proclaimed leader, Lucas Mangope and his partner, the National Party government.  The National Party bolstered his rule economically, through providing directly and indirectly, 74% of the annual budget.  Militarily, most apparent during the intervention to end the coup attempt in 1988, and also politically.  By 1994 Lucas Mangope retained power quite literally through force.  His electoral support among the people of the region stood at an all-time low of 2%.",

            "Thank you Sir.\n\"These struggles at a local and community level had the backing and organisational support of the UDF, although this had been banned in\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n12\nBoputhatswana and of the ANC, both from exile and also following its unbanning in 1990.  In addition to this, given the\n\t\tproximity of certain segments of Bophuthatswana to the border with Botswana, a high level of infiltration of MK cadres occurred in this particular region.  Clashes between MK soldiers and the BDF ...\"\nThat is the Bophuthatswana Defence Force -\n\"... and the South African Defence Force, took place around Zeerust, Ramaquabane, Lamutso and Singh.  Such clashes served as an inspiration for those persons resisting the government in the rural villages.  The ANC, while in exile, also sent strong messages to the population through broadcasts on Radio Freedom and through the President of the African National Congress, Oliver Tambo.\"\nFurthermore, we will be calling a witness from the African National Congress to give whatever support is necessary, to this particular evidence. The extract which is quoted here deals with a message which is certainly a most unfortunate message, but it is important that that message be placed on record, and that appear in Shishaba, and it read as follows:\n\"Let the racist magistrates and lawyers shout their lungs out in scorn of the necklace method for punishing collaborators.  Let them call the\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n13\npeople's courts Kangaroo Courts, if they want to.  But we shall always reply to  them by saying, when we say power to the\n\t\tpeople, we also mean the right to suppress the enemies of the people, we also mean the country's administration and control by ordinary people.\n\t\tStruggles during this period in Bophuthatswana and throughout the country were focused on destroying and destabilising the government at all levels.  In communities throughout the country attacks were launched against the most immediate representatives of government, namely the councillors, the policemen, the soldiers and all those who were perceived as collaborators.  Those who created government policies and sat in government largely escaped harm. Those that they placed in positions of authority at a local level were those who felt the brunt of the people's anger and frustration.  In many areas the political struggles that were waged around the slogan `Forward to People's Power', were struggles to remove illegitimate authorities at local level and to replace them with legitimate ones.  Hence, the emergence of block committees, of action committees as we saw in this particular case, of street committees, self-defence\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n15\nunits and people's courts.\n\t\tIn Bophuthatswana in the areas such as Garankuwa and Shisoshongowe which lay in\n\t\tclose geographic proximity to Pretoria, this is precisely what was happening. In the more rural communities similar struggles were being waged, but the circumstances and the structures were different. The illegitimate authorities and those who were regarded as collaborators, like the deceased, who have been given positions of power by the previous President, the previous government of this homeland, against the wishes of the community as will be testified to later in this application.\n\t\tThroughout 1990, Bopthuthatswana saw intense resistance and confrontation with the security forces.  The UDF's Murphy Morobo acknowledging the role of local organisations, we emphasise local organisations because it is very pertinent, said at the time the disturbances in these areas are a vindication of our position that at the end of the day it is the people on the ground who will determine the future.  Both in the rural and peri-urban areas of the homelands, local civic structures under the broad umbrella of the Congress Movement, led the resistance struggles.  PHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n16\nThis was so in Winterveld, Phokeng and in the struggle against forced incorporation in Braklaagte and\n\t\tLeeufontein.  It was these struggles that ignited the widespread resistance that consumed Boputhatswana in 1990, the year under discussion, and it is necessary therefore to examine that briefly.  \n\t\tThe people of Braklaagte first heard of the plans to incorporate them from the then Western Transvaal into Bophuthatswana in 1986.  They then embarked on a lengthy and peaceful campaign to resist incorporation.  They petitioned the National Party Government.  They wrote numerous letters to them requesting meetings and highlighting the issues in the Press.  They were ignored by the Government until 1988 when there was a ray of hope when Mr Gerrit Viljoen agreed to meet a delegation headed by the then Chief Pachsi Sebogode.  Two weeks later they were however incorporated into Bophuthatswana, as was the neighbouring community of Leeufontein who until then had known nothing of this plan.  \nAll these factors, Sir, are relevant to the background of the actions which gave rise to this application.\n\"Following a court application\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n17\nincorporation of Bophuthatswana was declared valid and from April 1989 the\n\t\tBophuthatswana authorities and security\n\t\tforces moved into the villages.  This set off a cycle of resistance and bloody repression that has been well-documented.  The resistance culminated in July 1989 when nine policemen and two civilians were killed, following the banning of a community meeting at Leeufontein.  The leader, the president of Bophuthatswana, leader of the government, issued a strongly worded warning to these communities.\"\n This is what he said, and it is very important, if one recalls what was said: \n\"Bophuthatswana is like a prickly pear, very strong, tasty, but it is also dangerous.  I warn you strongly not to abuse me.  I am not your dust bin.  Do not play games with me.  If you do I will prick and pierce you like the prickly pear\".\n\t\tThe South African government was quick to blame radicals and the United Democratic Front, which was banned in Bophuthatswana, for the turmoil, and they put the South African Defence Force and the South African Police on standby.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Pik Botha said it has to be seen that the \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n19\nsecurity of South Africa and independent states are capable of ensuring calm.  He was, however, proved wrong.  Calm was\n\t\tnot ensured and resistance continued.  The President, the then President of Bophuthatswana, his hold on power became increasingly tenuous, despite his insistence in 1990 that Bophuthatswana would, and to quote him `be an independent state one hundred years from now'.\n\t\tIn 1994, deserted by his security forces and supported only by a small group of people, the Government of Bophuthatswana fell.\n\t\tIt is within this context that we must look at the history of the Baphokeng and the history of the two applicants, Boy Niali and Christopher Mokgatle.  \n\t\tThe Baphokeng, who number approximately\n\t\t300 000, live mainly in and around Phokeng, north of Rustenburg.  Phokeng is the main village in this tribal authority area with an additional 24 sub-villages.  While the Baphokeng have lived in this region since time immemorial, for modern purposes, one can start at the time of Sekethe III, who was the first of the line of Baphokeng Makwene Paramount Chiefs of which Chief Lebona Moloklehle is the 14th.\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n20\nSekethe ruled from about the year 1700.\"\nWe start here very briefly - there is an anecdote from oral history which is worth repeating.\n\"During the reign of Sekethe's son,\n\t\tDiali, incidentally, around 1750, the Baphokeng came into conflict with the Barutsi.  The Barutsi who considered themselves senior to the Baphokeng would come to the area annually to castrate the bulls belonging to the tribe.  They would select the best young bulls for themselves, leave a few for stud purposes and castrate the rest.  This custom was carried out under protest from the Baphokeng, and it is said that it was carried out in order to insult them.  One year Diali's four sons gathered with spectators to watch this custom. And each one of them had a spear hidden under his karos.  At a given sign they attacked the Barutsi and killed them almost to a man.  Barutsi declared war on the Baphokeng and a decisive battle was fought on a mountain pass.  The Baphokeng emerged as victors and ended the Barutsi's attempt at dominance.  \n\t\tToday there is a pile of stones which is 16 metres by 4 metres high in the pass.  Passers-by are required to drop a stone in memory of those who fell.\nPHOKENG HEARING\t\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n21\nThe previous chief of the Baphokeng was Chief Lebona Edward Molekhle who was quite publicly opposed to the homeland independence, as we know died last year. The conflict and animosity between the tribe and the Bophuthatswana Government dates back to this time.  The conflict has many facets to it, not least of which is the conflict over resources.  The Baphokeng had title to their land since 1883 and this land is situated on the Morenski Reef, which is where 80% of the world's platinum is mined.  The platinum mining contributed around 45% of the gross domestic product in Bophuthatswana and the Baphokeng receives approximately R75 million annually in royalties from Impala Platinum as a 16% royalty payment.  Between 1970 and 1990 close to 1 billion has been paid by Impala Platinum to Bophuthatswana in tax, mining leases and royalty payments.  In addition it pays approximately R465 million each year in wages and benefits to its employees.\"\nI should add that a large percentage of these employees are from Baphokeng.\n\"Under independence the head of the previous Bophuthatswana Government inherited from the South African Government the position of trustee of the Baphokeng lands and mineral rights.\"\nThis is very, very important for this application.\n\"As trustee he was entitled, amongst\nPHOKENG HEARING\t\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n22\nother things, to scrutinise the\n\t\tfinancial records of the mine.  A right which was not accorded to the tribe, the rightful owners of the land.  This dispute has been the subject of many court applications over many years and served to aggravate the political conflict between the tribe and the previous Bophuthatswana Government.  In all court disputes the president of Bophuthatswana sided with Impala Platinum, which as the tribe's attorney, James Sutherland said at the time, was extraordinary; as trustee he should co-operate and litigate on behalf of the Baphokeng, instead he sided with the mine.  \n\t\tChief Molekhehle insistently refused to take up the seat to which he was entitled in the homeland legislative assembly, and also refused to raise the Bophuthatswana flag at the tribal offices.  In 1983 the Baphokeng attempted to secede in accordance with section 82 of the Bophuthatswana Constitution, by passing a tribal resolution.  In response to this the president of Bophuthatswana visited Phokeng in May 1983 and told the tribe that their letter, which was sent to him, is a dream.  I have also come to \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n24\ntell you, he said, you must trek; I say\n\t\tvacate.  I am going to conduct a commission of inquiry here and I want you to know that from now on we are going to declare a state of emergency in Phokeng.  This was proclaimed on the 9th of May 1983, and back-dated to the 6th of May.\"\nI am not going to read the content of the emergency regulations. \n\"The commission of inquiry, the results of which were never published, was intended to determine, amongst other things, whether or not Chief Molekhehle was the rightful chief.  However, the then president of Bophuthatswana did return to Phokeng in April 1984, to tell the tribe ...\"\nAnd I must quote again, because it is in a statement which had consequences -\n\"... let me tell you it will never happen.  No matter what you may do, you will never secede from Bophuthatswana and be independent.  That will never happen.  We will deal with you as we deem fit.\n\t\tThere was a steady deterioration from then on in relations between the tribe and the chief and the president of Bophuthatswana. \n\t\tIn 1987, during a meeting between the \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n25\nchief, his wife and all 70 headmen, the\n\t\tpresident of Bophuthatswana said to the chief, you are a little infected finger which was affected by disease and must be cut away.   He said that to the chief.  On February 10 1988, an attempted coup took place in Mmbatho which was led by a person who was the leader of the Progressive People's Party and who also happened to be a member of the Baphokeng tribe, Rocky Malabane Mtsing.  The coup which was lasted 15 hours, was summarily stopped in its tracks by the South African Government.  The South African Defence Force entered the city, paratroopers staged a dramatic rescue of the president and his colleagues, who had been held in Mmbatho, in the Independent Stadium.  The military force was backed up by a very public show of political support. PW Botha was present, various other dignitaries, Magnus Malan and Minister Adriaan Vlok.  That evening, after the coup had been crushed, the then President of South Africa announced well, we have had these problems, but we are back in control, and then he corrected himself and said the President of Bophuthatswana is in full control. The reaction of the coup throughout the \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n26\ncountry had been one of celebration and\n\t\tjubilation.  Somewhat premature, as it turned out.  In Phokeng, Winterveld, Odimoritele, Unibo and elsewhere, people sang freedom songs, they toyi-toyed and they celebrated the downfall of the government.  The retributive clamp-down that followed was swift and severe.  In Phokeng itself the chief and his wife with several members of the tribe were detained without charge on suspicion that they had been involved in the coup attempt.  The chief was accused, during his interrogation, of being an executive member of the PPP, by giving Mtsing money for the coup and of using Mtsing as a front for a society of chiefs who wished to oust the then President of Bophuthatswana.  The suspicion of his involvement in the coup was never proved and was based on a somewhat flimsy premise that because the PPP which had led the coup had won all five seats in the 1987 election.  The chief and those in authority had been involved in the coup.  No evidence to this effect has ever been produced.\n\t\tFollowing the coup the perpetrators were charged in the Supreme Court of Bophuthatswana and they were convicted.  In addition, the commission of inquiry \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n28\nwas appointed to investigate the\n\t\tinvolvement of the PPP in the coup, which resulted in the party being declared a banned organisation in terms of the Internal Security Act.  At no time,  during either the trial of the participants in the coup or during the commission, was the chief, his wife or other detainees from the tribe ever mentioned.  Despite this, the harassment of the chief, of his wife, Mrs Molokegle and other members of the tribe continued unabated.  \n\t\tSoon after his release from detention Chief Molokegle arrived at his home on the 18th of March and saw between 20 and 25 police vehicles in the driveway.  He decided to drive through the yard and exit.  He was able to do this undetected, as he was in a Kombi at the time and none of the policemen realised it was the chief.  He then left the country and went into exile in Botswana. Before leaving he appointed his Longwana, Mr Cecil Timochole, then a deputy chief as acting chief during his absence.  This was a decision supported unanimously by his headmen.  \n\t\tThe continuing harassment of the tribe took many forms, but it is worth here looking briefly at the harassment of Mrs Moloklegle and the Baphokeng Women's Club in particular. \n\t\tFrom the time of the coup until mid July\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n29\n1988 Mrs Mologlegle was questioned and/or her home was searched by members of the\n\t\tpolice and army, a total of 16 times.   Her phone was cut off.  The organisation which she headed, the Baphokeng Women's Club was banned in terms of the Internal Security Act.  When a successful court application had the ban overturned the President of Bophuthatswana in his capacity as Minister of Law and Order, then proclaimed the club an illegal organisation.  The harassment culminated in Mrs Moloklegle residence permit being revoked, despite the fact that she had been living in the area for 28 years.  In addition all meetings of the Baphokeng tribal authority and the tribal council were banned.  These events made it increasingly difficult for the tribe to emerge and co-ordinate their affairs.  \n\t\tDespite the fact that Chief Moloklegle had appointed Cecil Mpumigole as acting chief and despite the fact that brothers are not supposed to stand as regents for absent chiefs, the President of Bophuthatswana unilaterally appointed the chief's brother, George Moloklegle into this position.  This was fiercely opposed by the tribe.  In a letter from the tribe, on the 10th of July 1990, to \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n30\nthe then President of South Africa, it was stated his absence over the past two\n\t\tyears has left the tribe without their chosen and respected chief, and President Mangope has seized the advantage created by this vacuum and appointed in his stead the chief's brother, who acts in accordance with the government's behest and not in a manner which enjoys the support or respect of the tribe.\n\t\tWith the appointment of a sympathetic acting chief, the President of Bophuthatswana also ensured that persons sympathetic to him occupied positions of power within the tribal council.  Among other appointments was that of Glad Mokgatle as the chairperson of the tribal council.\n\t\tFrom 1980 onwards the tribe made repeated attempts to resolve the conflict with the President of Bophuthatswana and to ensure the safe return of Chief Lebona Molokegle.  These attempts were met without exception with rebuff, harassment and repeated detentions.  On the 4th of April 1990 the tribe wrote to the President of Bophuthatswana, requesting an appointment to discuss the leadership of the Baphokeng.  All the signatories to \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n31\nthis letter were picked up at their homes in the early hours of the morning and\n\t\ttaken to Mmabatho on the instructions of the president.\n\t\tThe President of Bophuthatswana continually threatened to detain Chief Molokegle if he returned to the region.  This threat was made to the entire tribe when the President of Bophuthatswana addressed a meeting in Phokeng on June the 25th 1990.\n\t\tThe President of Bophuthatswana refused to meet the tribe unless the request for a meeting came through the acting chief.  When the representatives failed to secure a meeting with the President, they, despite the fact that the acting chief, was in their view, part of the problem, wrote to George Molokegle requesting a meeting.  The response to this on June the 9th 1990, was the arrest and detention of 20 persons who were associated with the request.  Such detentions also included Mrs Molokegle's typist who happened to be five months present at the time, merely on the suspicion of having typed the letter.  On the 15th of June another letter was written, calling for the resignation of the acting chief.  This letter was signed by about 1 000 members of the \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n33\ntribe.  It was then delivered by approximately\n\t\t1 000 people to the civic centre. \n\t\tLetters were also written to the then President of South Africa, President De Klerk, and to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister Pik Botha, but to no avail.  In the letter to Mr De Klerk the tribal representatives voiced their concern over the level of tension in the region.\"\nMr Chairperson, it is important that one is aware of the extent to which these representations were made.\n\"It has become clear that our efforts to achieve any proper resolution of this problem through dialogue with the Bophuthatswana Government are fruitless.  Feelings amongst the Baphokeng community have reached a very high level of tension and anger.  This was made manifest when Pres Mangope was loudly booed by the community when he recently addressed them.\"\nThat is to quote from the letter -\n\"It must be clear here that these events were taking place during 1990, a momentous year, the year of change throughout South Africa, not least of which was the unbanning of the African National Congress, the PAC as well as the release of imprisoned leaders, including our present President, Mr\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n34\nNelson Mandela.\n\t\tThese events appeared to harden the attitude of the Bophuthatswana Government, which had become increasingly resistant to change, and to threats to powers.\n\t\tHundreds of thousands of people in Bophuthatswana, including many members of the Baphokeng tribe had joined the ANC upon its unbanning.\n\t\tIn an article by Dennis Beckett - at the time the article was entitled The Tribe that Lost its Chief.  Reference is made to this.  He wrote:\n`In the vicinity of Sumani Mokgatle's palace it is nothing unusual to see people wearing ANC T-shirts. In the eyes of much of Bophuthatswana officialdom, the green, yellow and black insignia is a red rag to a bull.\n\t\tIn Phokeng itself a Press statement released following the June detentions, the tribe said the following:  One cannot overlook the events and profound changes that have and are continuing to take place in Southern Africa.  In expressing the wish of the Baphokeng tribe to meet with the President of \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n35\nSouth Africa, to voice the\n\t\tdissatisfaction of the tribe and the government of Bophuthatswana.  The delegation was doing nothing more than seeking to join the rest of South Africa's black communities in achieving a unitary state in which everyone would have equal rights.\n\t\tPolitical tensions and conflict were increasing throughout Bophuthatswana during this period. In an interview in March 1990 Mr Walter Sisulu described the unrest in Bophuthatswana as a popular revolt against repressive dictatorship.  He went on to say `we in the ANC have welcomed this popular rejection of undemocratic tyrannies which have been imposed on our people. Our people were never consulted on the Bantustan system'.  The acting chief in Phokeng and the chairperson of the tribal council despite the ever-increasing tension within the community, attempted to convene meetings of the headmen.  When most of the headmen refused to attend such meetings they were fined.  When they refused to pay these fines they were arrested and charged.  The chairman of the tribal council, Mr Glad Mokgatle became increasingly unpopular and as a member \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n37\nof the tribe himself, his actions and\n\t\tthose of other supporters of the Bophuthatswana Government were viewed as traitorous and disloyal to the chief.  Mr Mokgatli was increasingly viewed as nothing more than an instrument of the previous government and viewed as illegitimate.\n\t\tOn the 29th of December 1990 a meeting of the Phiris, all the active men of the tribe between the ages of 18 and 65, was held at the Roman Catholic Church.  At this meeting various issues were discussed relating to the chief and the ongoing administration.  The meeting was informed that the chief could still not return out of fear for his safety, and that his health was deteriorating.  The meeting resolved that those representing the Bophuthatswana Government in Phokeng, those persons working under Glad Mokgatle, at the civic centre, should not longer be allowed to handle the affairs of the tribe.  They were regarded as illegitimate and questions were being asked about their role in the theft of money from the tribe.  It was resolved therefore that the Phiris would go to the civic centre to regain control over their own affairs and they would obtain the keys to the building for this\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n38\npurpose.\"\nI will not deal with the rest of this submission at this stage, because it then moves into the actual events and the actual circumstances of the representations which were made and the incident which gave rise to the murder around which application revolves.\n\tI now would need to call three witnesses, who will be testifying to specific issues within this document and elaborating on some of those issues.  We would request, if it is possible, a five-minute adjournment just to get our witnesses in line.  They are within the community.  The applicants are sitting there.  The witnesses are available. I have not seen them, I can't see them at this moment, but it would be opportune just to organise them and to agree on the order in which we call them. \n\tIn conclusion, I would just like to thank you for your indulgence in allowing me to place this background paper on record.  We believe that it is very important that it was placed on record. I thank you, Sir.",

            "Before we adjourn, will those who assist us in organising this meeting, ensure that as many people as possible receive head-phones so that they can hear the evidence that is going to be given by the witnesses. We will now adjourn for a short while to enable counsel to martial his witnesses.\nHEARING ADJOURNS\n39\nTAPE 2 - SIDE B \n............................\n\t....... There was a lot of violence in Phokeng and the state of emergency was still in place at that time.  Since then I have been arrested eight times under the State of Emergency Act.  The Bophuthatswana police would come to my home and harass my parents and the people with whom I stayed.  \n\tIn 1990 it was in June, on the 5th of June, we were arrested together with Chief Mokgatle's son.  There were five of us.  I am referring to the person who is now the chief of the Baphokeng.  We were arrested together with him and we were taken to Thabani police station.  We were interrogated there and at that time we didn't understand what was happening.  And we were told that we have bombed a house belonging to one of Mr Mangope's members.  They said it was me and Mr Molokegle.  Because of lack of evidence they said no, we have bombed a house that belongs to Chief Mangope's supporter, and we were released.  \n\tOn the 29th of December in 1990 we met together as the Phiris.  There was a meeting at the Roman Catholic Church.  We came together as Baphokeng and the meeting was actually about the information that our king or our chief will never come alive back to Baphokeng, and we were told that those words were taken out by Mr Glad Mokgatle.  Seeing that I was one member of the action committee, this issue didn't satisfy us at all.  And we decided that as the Baphokeng - I must indicate that the building that we are sitting in today caused all these problems. Even the people who are Mr Mangope's supporters wanted to do anything they want in our tribe.  \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n40\n\tWe realised that it would be better to get the keys from Mr Billy Ramoresi, who was the secretary of the Baphokeng tribe.  We left as a group and we went to Mr Billy Ramoresi's house and we found him at his place.  We were surprised to see police there and we demanded to speak to Mr Ramoresi because he is Baphokeng and we are also the Baphokeng and the police started harassing us.  They shot at us with rubber bullets and they were throwing tear gas at us.  We ran away.  We ran and dispersed, but luckily we managed to meet again but this time we met at Legato.  We were 10 in number.  The 10 of us were members of the action committee.  Five of the members were from Johannesburg branch of the Baphokeng and the other five were members of Baphokeng action crime, based at Phokeng.  \n\tWe agreed that seeing that we haven't received the keys during the time we needed them we would now go back to Mr Mokgatle to get the keys, because he was now the chairman elected by Mr Mangope.  \n\tWe decided to go and see Mr Mokgatle and we were told that he is not at his residence, he went to see his girlfriend at Tchaneng. We left in a Kombi.  The Kombi was belonging to one of the action committee members from the Johannesburg branch and we went to Tchaneng.  \n\tOn our arrival we knocked and we found that woman called the girlfriend.  Then we asked her where is Mr Glad Mokgatle.  Mr Mokgatle came from the bedroom and he had a panga in his hand.  It was sharpened on both sides.  If I have to give the measurement it would be twice the size of my hand.  Four of us went into the house and the others were remaining outside.    \n\tOne of us, the deceased, Mr Mgopani, was at the corner. PHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n41\nMr Mokgatle wanted to attack Musi with his panga.  Because I was close to him, I managed to jump and stopped the panga with my hand and it chopped my hand, but at least I have already saved Mr Mgopani's life. I took the panga.  Because the people who were with me by that time were now angry.  They gave him a few claps and they took him with them.  \n\tWe locked him in the Kombi and we drove off with him.  We asked him where are the civic centre's keys, because we want to lock it up. We told him that the tribe was crying, the tribe was complaining about his administration, we want the keys back.  He said he doesn't know anything about the keys.  We told him not to lie because he is a councillor elected by President Mangope.  We told him that we wanted the keys from him because he has to know where the keys are.  He didn't co-operate and we saw it necessary to take him hostage.  \n\tIt was our intention to keep this man hostage until President Mangope listened to us.  We told ourselves that we are going to hold him as a hostage until we get the keys.  They decided we should drop him off there and some of the members said no, let us just kill him.  Others said no, can we keep him hostage. You know that in a large group people get emotional and you cannot stop them, and it happened that they attacked him.  I must say I was one of those people who attacked him, because I was already emotional, because he didn't want to listen to our issue, we wanted the keys.  \tMost unfortunately we lost our temper, we hit him until he died.  We got into the Kombi and we drove off.  We went to our different homes and that was the end of the story.  Our aim was actually to hold Mogale hostage so that Mr PHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n42\nMangope can realise that we were serious about our demands.  We wanted our chief to come back home, that was the first thing we wanted from Mr Mangope, we wanted the state of emergency to be eradicated because we wanted the Bophuthatswana Government to be dismantled because it was oppressing the people.  There was no progress among the people out there.  (Applause).",

When we met with the Phiri we took a decision.  We said to ourselves we are going to search for the keys, the keys to our offices.  Those keys do not belong to the Bophuthatswana Government, they belong to the Baphokeng tribe.  And then we left to go and see Mr Billie Ramirise.\n\tWhen we entered his place, trying to ask him where the keys were, the police arrived, the Bophuthatswana police.  They said nothing, they started shooting at people with the rubber bullets.  We hadn't had information about the keys.  And then we dispersed.  We were many.  And it happened that we came together as the action committee.  We said as an action committee we don't know where the keys are and we asked ourselves do we have any plan to get those keys, because they belong to us as the Baphokeng tribe.  Because there were many of us, there were a lot of suggestions as well.  \n\tAnd the decision to take Mr Mokgatle, the chairman, that was the right decision, because we thought he would tell us everything he knows about the keys.\n\tThere was a concern raised, seeing that the police were so on arms, how can we get to Mr Mokgatle's house, are they going to shoot at us, what are we going to do.  Then we decided to kidnap Mr Glad Mokgatle.  The decision was to keep him at a place where he would not be seen by anyone.  \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n74\nWe would interrogate him, to ask him questions about the keys.  And if he gives us an answer, some of our members would go and get the keys.  That was a very good suggestion and we all agreed.  \n\tWe got into the Kombi, ten of us and we went to Chaneng.  When we arrived at Chaneng other members of the group got outside. They went into the house.  I was one of the people who stayed behind.  I was surprised to see them taking a long time.  Because we knew, kidnapping is something that happens so quick.  I wanted to go and investigate what was happening.  I used the front entrance and I met Mr Glad Mokgatle standing at the bedroom door, carrying a panga.  I was scared to enter because he would start with me, he would kill me first.  I decided to go to the back door.  When I entered the house he had already been grabbed by the rest of the men and they took him into the Kombi.  \n\tI thought he would tell us where the keys were.  There was no order in the Kombi, because everybody wanted to ask him where the keys were.   While he tried to answer there would be a question from the next one, and in that manner we couldn't hear where the keys were.  \n\tWe drove into the veld.  I am working hard at Gauteng.  While we were still driving I saw the Kombi stopping.  The door was opened and Mr Glad Mokgatle was already on the ground, and it was a fight.  I got out of the Kombi and I just stood surprised.  I was really angry, because there was never such a decision to assault him.  I saw some of the members getting into the Kombi so quickly and it drove off.  When we drove off I had a look at Mr Mokgatle and I could see that he was still alive.  I took the sabre from him and \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n76\nI chopped him.  I chopped him personally.  I chopped him because I realised that we were heading for the prison.  I wanted to seep away the evidence.  (Applause).\n\tI didn't want anybody to know or to have any light that Mr Mokgatle was here.  We went into the Kombi and we drove off.  \n\tOn the way some of the people got off the Kombi. I went to a funeral at the vigil.  Later on I went home.  At home, the following morning, the police started to arrest people.  The whole day I wasn't feeling well, because I had never been arrested before and I had this strange feeling throughout my whole body. It came to pass.  I told my wife that this BOP police arrest anyone indiscriminately, but I didn't explain to her that we have committed a crime.  Then I moved away, saying that I would come later.  At that point I decided to go away to Johannesburg.\n\tI stayed a few days in Johannesburg and the BOP police came to Johannesburg and arrested me there.  They brought me back to BOP.   After I was here in BOP I appeared in court.  I was sentenced 15 years imprisonment.",

We tried by all means, we as the Baphokeng tribe, trying to get the government to solve our problems which we had, as the Baphokeng tribe.  I still remember, if I remember well on the 10th of July 1990, we wrote a letter to President FW de Klerk and we said in the letter please come and talk to the Bophuthatswana Government, so that we, as we try to meet him as the Baphokeng tribe, he must attend to our needs or to the call, and the central Government, that is that these things are now so much developed, we don't understand them any more.  The central Government under the presidency of Mr De Klerk, when they answered us, they sent us the message that we share your needs of the Baphokeng tribe, but I can't get into your problems because they are not mine.  That is the answer was from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Pik Botha, who answered us by saying that.  We tried again, we\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n103\tMR K C MOKGATLE\nas the Baphokeng tribe, that we are not satisfied about the\nway you answered us, Mr De Klerk; please reply us in a satisfactory manner before we go to the international community.  When the second letter came up, the letter said the Baphokeng, for the Bophuthatswana Government to come in and negotiate with you, that is when we started writing letters to the Bophuthatswana Government, to come and negotiate with us.  And we explained to the Boputhatswana Government that firstly, we want them to explain to us about the millions of rands which are coming from our mines, where are those rands going to.  Secondly, they had to explain to us what was Mr Edward Molokegtle fault, because he was chucked away from Phokeng.  \n\tThe former Bophuthatswana Government replied by saying he doesn't want anything from us, because our letter didn't reach him through the acting Chief.  We then started coming into the problems we had with the keys, because we knew that if we could get hold of those keys, we lock away all the crooks who were staying here.  (Applause).The people who burgled or treat the people and came to share the money here, we as the Baphokeng, we didn't build these offices so that people could do any crookery in there.

Therefore, the Baphokeng tribe, I want to tell you that is not the truth, that didn't happen.  And the person who told you that I was a sell-out, told you lies.  I am really very standing in what I say in front of this Committee, that if someone disputes what I am saying, he can tell the Committee now to investigate me and whatever errors they find in their investigation, they can always return to the Baphokeng tribe and tell them that I wasn't telling the truth; he was belonging to such-and-such a party, he was built a house with the moneys of the party.   \n\tThen I would also like to plea with you that, please forget about the past, let's start living together, let me belong to your community again, let me not be an outcast in my own people.  I have my younger brother by the name of Norman.  I also ask the same for him, because we lead one and the same life, me and him.  \n\tTherefore I want to tell the Baphokeng people that the impressions you had of me were never true.

            "Thank you.   Firstly, let me repeat what the chief said yesterday when he welcomed the guests here and opened these proceedings, when he said this is the beginning of the events heard by this Committee in Phokeng, and Phokeng will have to be exemplary in South Africa.   That was true.  I want to point these words to the Baphokeng and tell them that you are very lucky that the Amnesty Committee started its proceedings here at the Baphokeng Civic Centre.  \tGood people, what I want to say, is Phokeng has been in existence for a long time.  Therefore the Baphokeng, all the Baphokeng people are one community.  There is no one who doesn't relate to the other here in Phokeng.   What happens here in Phokeng which brought us here, really touched every member of the Baphokeng tribe and we are very happy that today the perpetrators have come and explained to us what happened.\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n127\tS A PHETOEANE\n\tIn sharing the council of the Phokeng, but please allow me with due respect, to say to the Committee, we as the committee of the Phokeng, as I have already mentioned that you are a family.  The elders of Phokeng are elders to all of us, the grandfathers, the grandmothers and the words of what I didn't like, which I never personally liked, is that when we talk about older people or an elderly, we must speak street language or use terms such as girlfriend or boyfriend.  That's how the Baphokeng people are.  Although we are very sad we still have to avoid such words or names, because these don't show respect in any way.  \n\tGood people, I would like to say that you must erase such words as girlfriends whilst you are referring to our grandfathers and grandmothers.\n\tI would further like to say to the Committee and the Baphokeng tribe who doesn't know or who don't know,  that me as Sambitso Phetoane, the guys who performed these deeds, who came before this Committee, are people who I know very well.  The person unto whom they did this is my father in my terms.  I would like to say I would like to forgive them and ask them to consider before doing such things, that they are doing it to their own community.\n\tFurthermore, the perpetrators of this incident have already said or have told you their feelings and the sons of the deceased have also told you how they feel about the whole scenario.  Therefore, I would like to plead with the Baphokeng that please, the difficult times we had have already passed.  Therefore, this is the time to talk about what happened in the past so that we can be forgiven today.  \tThe whole community is like that.  I am not only talking about the people who gave evidence here.  I am\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n128\tS A PHETOEANE\ntalking about the whole community, because these difficulties were not only for the people who gave evidence here, the whole community was living in those difficult times as a nation.\n\tPlease, let's sit down like we are sitting today and reveal the truth and put it on the table before the Committee.  I am happy with what Mr Charles Mokgatle said when he said during those difficult times, you said I was an outcast, but today, the Commission is here so that Mr Mokgatle can present his story and you can listen to him.  So we have to forgive one another as a Baphokeng tribe next time, without the presence of the Committee, so that we can live together again in harmony as we did before.  \n\tI plead with you the good community, let's forget about the past, come here and sit down and talk about these things so that we can forgive one another and start living together in harmony like we did before again.  \n\tGood people, in those difficult times in the past, many of our heroes left us, who were upright in the community, like Mr Glad Mokgatle, Mr Magetla Phetoane, Mr Goporana Sorane, Mr P...(indistinct) Rappor, but people fughting about Baphokeng, who Phokeng had as their pride.  When we talked about Phokeng we were referring to such people and they left us today, but if we can come together as a community. Those are heroes who left us, they will again come and live within us, if we together live in harmony and have forgiven each other or one another about the past.  \n\tWhen I am finished, I would like to say, I would like to thank all the Baphokeng who in these two past days have come here to listen to the evidence, to listen to the truth when it emerges. I would like to thank the Committee for\nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\n129\tS A PHETOEANE\ncoming here to the rural area and not only considering the urban areas.  We thank them for that respect they showed for us and the Baphokeng tribe has come back together again and the other things we leave to the Committee.   I thank you very much.",

Reference is made to Judge Waddington, that should be Judge Friedman.  We apologise for that error.\n\tThe second requirement is, we need to satisfy you that the offence is associated with a political objective, and that we will deal with shortly.  \n\tThirdly, that the offence was committed in the course of the conflicts of the past.  \n\tNow in dealing with the previous one, namely, that the offence is associated with the political objective, we will simultaneously refer very briefly to conflicts of the past.

            "I accept that.\n\tWe can then move off that particular point and refer to section 23 which is the section and I would just like to read the paragraph:\n\"Whether a particular act, omission or offence contemplated in subsection (2) is an act associated with a political objective, shall be decided with reference to the following criteria.\"\nNow before referring to those criteria, I would just like to make the point that quite clearly, the Act is worded in a way that those criteria are not pre-emptory and that all that needs to occur, is that when one is considering whether PHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\nMR CURRIN\t139\tADDRESS\nor not an offence is associated with a political objective,\none needs to have reference to those particular criteria.  If the applicants happen to fail, if they happen to fail in your minds, in respect of - with reference to one of those criteria, we do not understand that the application will be fatal.  With that in mind, we would like to go through the various sections within 23 and argue our case as far as the offence is concerned, being an offence associated with a political objective.\n\tIn the first instance, we are dealing with a common law offence, which was associated with a political objective.  In other words, in our view we need to satisfy you that the murder was associated with a political objective and not that the murder was in itself a political crime.\n\tIf we have reference to motive.  We considered the evidence of the two applicants in trying to establish motive.  What we have gleaned and teased out of that evidence, is that they both had as their motive - at least part of their motive, a fear of being arrested, tortured and possibly being detained.  \n\tBoy Diali added to that and said that he felt it was necessary to get rid of Glad Mokgatle in order to show the Bophuthatswana Government, and in particular, the President, that they were serious.\n\tWhile talking about motive, dealing with motive, I think it is also necessary to emphasise that in the context of motive we believe there is the provision in the Act that specifically says that one would be excluded if a murder was committed or an offence was committed for personal gain.  We do not believe that there can be any question of personal gain being achieved by the two applicants in regard to the \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\nMR CURRIN\t141\tADDRESS\noffence which they committed.\n\tThere is another very specific exclusion and that is out of personal malice, ill-will or spite directed against the victim.   We do not believe that this crime was motivated by personal malice, ill-will or spite.  \n\tWe do not believe that it is necessary, as we understand the Act, to persuade you that the murder was committed with a political motive.  The Act does not place that requirement on the shoulders of the applicants.  We need to show that the offence was associated with a political objective.  \n\tHad that been the requirement, the Act would have said quite unequivocally that the offence would have - should be an offence with a political motive.\n\tWith regard to context.  The offence was committed without any doubt, in the context of political uprisings, in the context of certainly a political uprising or disturbance.  If one looks at the very broad context of political uprising, we think one can go beyond just the uprising right here, and say that it was also part of - there was a greater uprising, namely within Bophuthatswana, in the context of reincorporation in South Africa.   But then of course, there was the particular uprising in Phokeng.  So certainly, Sir, and members of the Committee, there can be no doubt at all that the context in which the murder was committed, was in itself a political context.  And we think that is important, in fact, critical.\n\tSubsection (3) talks about the legal and the factual nature of the Act, including the gravity of the Act.  Now we know the legal nature of the Act.  We know that it was murder.  We know the factual nature of the Act. We have \nPHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\nMR CURRIN\t142\tADDRESS\nheard detailed evidence about how the murder was committed.\nWe are not going to go through that evidence, but we realise that we need to address you on the question of gravity. \n\tThere can be no doubt whatsoever, that this murder was a grave crime, and that it was a brutal crime.  We won't try and persuade you otherwise.  Having said that, when one refers to gravity in our view, one does it in the context of the particular crime.  In other words, one can't necessarily say that because it was a murder it was more grave than it would have been had it have been a serious assault.  Gravity must be considered in the context of the crime.  So we look at gravity in the context of murder.  We would argue that in certain circumstances a murder could be so grave that it would play a very, very significant role in your minds in possibly concluding that an application should not be granted.\n\tIn this particular case, however, we believe that there are a number of factors and we would like to call them for the sake of convenience, we would like to refer them to mitigating factors.  Factors that mitigate against the gravity which we concede and factors which we believe you should take into consideration when deciding on the applicants' fate.\n\tFirst of all, it is quite clear that the murder was not premeditated.",

You will find that nowhere in the Act.  What the Act says is that the offence must be associated with the political objective.  And what was the political objective?  With what political objective was the offence associated?  The political objective was to obtain keys of this building and this entire structure.  That was the immediate political objective that was verbalised and motivated by the applicants and others. We, as lawyers, know the significance of keys in the context of law.  We know that there was a time in Roman Law when they spoke about, in common law when they spoke about the transfer of property through the handing over of keys.   That is really what the keys symbolised.  Their political objective, their associated political objective was not only to get keys, and we heard that, it was to take over the - to take back the affairs of the tribe, to take back governance of the tribe.  To take back that power of the tribe of their own people.  That was the political objective.  The question that we need to ask and in respect of which we need to satisfy you, is merely whether the offence which we say was an ordinary common law offence, is associated with that political objective.

Regretfully, the liFe was lost in a brutal fashion and caused pain to this community, and we have heard about that pain.\n\tHaving said that, and not in any way wanting to diminish that pain, and the seriousness of the offence, one can say that it is almost a miracle that many people were not killed in that immediate conflict.  That one person was murdered during an attempt to regain control of their own governance.  \n\tFurthermore, one needs to see it in the context of their own suffering as a people.  The context of the oppression, of the exploitation, of the brutality, of the torture which they suffered at the hands of the security forces under the control of the then government.  \n\tIn that regard we have been told that the Human Rights Violations Committee will be here tomorrow, to begin to take PHOKENG HEARING\tAMNESTY/GAUTENG\nMR CURRIN\t155\tADDRESS\nstatements from the people about that suffering.\n\tWe are saying that if one looks at the killing, at the murder in that context and in the context of what the action\ncommittee which had been elected and which represented the people, set out to achieve, that we do not believe that the offence was disproportionate to that objective.",

You have behaved very, very well.  I thank you very much and I wish to remind you once again, that in the course of time the Committee which deals with the violations of human rights, will probably be sitting in this part of the world to consider representations by people who may have or who may desire to make representations to them, namely victims - not only the victims of this particular case, but victims of other political incidents and when that happens, I have no doubt you will be notified of the sitting of that Committee.  \n\tThere may be some here who might not have felt courageous enough to publicly inform that they would like to make representations to us.
