<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom, are you ready with your next witness, or do you want us to take a short break?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I would like to just go through the statement with the next applicant.  He was the person who was never here and only arrived this morning for the first time.  So I think I could use a little bit of time going through his statement.  I ask for a short adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So as to get a sense of what's ...(indistinct), the next witness that you intend calling is Mr Magubane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That's indeed so, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would people in the hall please keep quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>	Do you know at this stage who you would call after Mr Magubane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The next witness I intend calling is Sonny Michael Mkwanazi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the applicant who has always been in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Ja, Mr Magubane and Sonny Michael Mkwanazi have both been in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, very well, we will then give you the opportunity to recognise Mr Magubane.  We will come back at 3.30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That will be sufficient time, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I see counsel in the Committee room please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>

<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson, at this stage of the proceedings I just want to get on record.  My name is H Botha and I'm appearing on behalf of Mr Peens, an implicated party in this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> May I be excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, by all means.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I take it that by being excused you mean finding some convenient place at which you will be sitting in order to follow the proceedings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Indeed so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom?</p>

<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  I take it that you are going to speak Sotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">RUBEN MAGANGA DEBOGO MAGUBANE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you may be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>	Yes, Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>	Mr Magubane, what is your level of education?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I did not go to school, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I'm going to show you a form contained in the bundle on page 79, page 80, page 81, and I'm also going to show you a mark, a cross, did you make that cross on this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now this document is Form 1 has been explained to you and that what is written there has been explained to you, do you confirm that contents of this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Next to this document are two further pages, an annexure answering some of the questions asked in the form, has this also been explained to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you agree with the contents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The one answer given in this annexure or the explanation I would rather say, is to explain the political objective which you wanted to achieve by attacking Boipatong.  Now apart from what is stated here I want you to explain in your own words why did you attack Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I'll be able to explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> In 1991, my parents' house was destroyed, their house was burnt in Sharpeville.  I don't know why.  People came to look for me and I was not inside.  That is why I took part in the attack in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After you'd moved into KwaMadala hostel, could you move freely in Boipatong or any of the other Vaal Triangle townships?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> In the whole of Vaal Triangle I was not able to move freely.  My parents were not allowed to see them with me or to - they ran to Boipatong when their house was burnt in Sharpeville but to go to them in Boipatong I was not able to.  If I were to enter in Boipatong or Sharpeville or anywhere in the Vaal Triangle I would be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You testified that your parents' house in Sharpeville was burnt down.  What I want to know is why did you not attack Sharpeville rather than Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Sharpeville was too far from KwaMadala hostel.  The nearest place was our target, which was Boipatong.  If Sharpeville was nearer to KwaMadala hostel, we would attack Sharpeville but because Boipatong was near and we were able to go there on foot, we chose Boipatong as our target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In the answer you said that the ANC people were in control of the Self Defence Units, can you just explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> It is because that in the whole of the township, if you were kidnapped by the SDUs, all residents of Boipatong would take part in  your torture or in your attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know to which political party the Self Defence Units belonged to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I would not say I know which organisation they fell in.  I was a member of the IFP, there was no member of the IFP who belonged to the SDUs.  I would not say as to whether they fell within PAC or ANC or as to whether they fall in one organisation but I know that PAC was never suppressed or harassed to the extent that they had to leave the township as we did as members of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Certain particulars were required from you, the questions appear on page 85 and 86, and your answers on page 87 to page 89.  Do you confirm the answers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Maybe if you can read them to me I will be able to confirm or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.  I'll read them again.  The question is - and you indicated you want to effect a change there, that's to me.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>"When did you first move into the KwaMadala hostel?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>The answer given here:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>"More or less January 1992."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I said so, that early January is the time that I went to KwaMadala.  The date is the wrong one, I went there in 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So you want that date to read 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The next question</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>"Were there two groups of attackers?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>And your answer was:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>"Yes."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>Do you stand by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>MR STRYDOM</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>"Who led the two groups?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>You said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>"Mkhize and Damarra."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>Are you happy with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> That is Damarra Chonco and Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And the question was</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>"In which one were you?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>You said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>"I'm not sure anymore but I think it was Mkhize's group."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>Do you stand by that answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> My answer was that I was not sure in which group I was but I saw Mr Mkhize, so I fell under Mkhize's group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The question was</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>"Did you see AK47 rifles on the eve of the 17th?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>And your answer was:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>"Yes."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The next question</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>"Where did you first see these weapons on this evening?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>And you said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>"At the stadium."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> May the legal representative please be slow, we are not able to follow the questions led by the legal representative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I will go slower.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps it would be useful if you also indicate where you are reading at this stage so that they can follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I'll see they get a copy of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> I've just handed a copy to them, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> They're indicating they need another one.  The other panel needs one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> You may continue, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Alright, thank you.  I'll read the third question, question 3.2</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>"Did Mr Damarra Chonco bring weapons to the hostel in a vehicle, a Blue Nissan Skyline?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, at the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And you answer to 3.2 is</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>"I saw the blue Nissan Skyline at the stadium but did not see that Damarra brought any weapons."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>

<blockquote class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>"During the meeting prior to the attack the hostel dwellers complained to Mkhize about the ongoing intimidation and problems with the people of Boipatong."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>Now I want to ask you if the complaints just relate to Boipatong or other townships in the Vaal triangle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> It was not only about Boipatong, it was all about the townships within the Vaal Triangle.</p>

<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anything in the affidavit which the witness does not agree with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, the reason why he asked me to read it again is because we did not have a proper interpreter and he couldn't point to anything that is wrong but he elected that's it's properly interpreted to him at the stage when we have the hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, alright.  Well in that event, proceed.</p>

We wanted Mkhize to take a decision to act against the comrades.  He said that we must keep ourselves ready for an attack.</blockquote>

<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>	In Boipatong I was in Mkhize's group.  We broke down a wire barrier.  We saw a certain amount of people at a distance around fires.  We fired shots in their direction.  They ran away.  We started going into premises.  We actually were looking for SDUs and comrades.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>	The group, including me, went further to attack everybody and everything.  I started shooting people in houses and also outside.  I don't know at which houses.  People jumped through windows.  Some of the group stabbed people.  I cannot remember who stabbed.  I can remember that Samuel Tshabango hit someone with a kierrie.  Some of the people plundered houses.  I took a blanket and a hi-fi set.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>	We then left Boipatong.  I went with the group through the main gate of the hostel.  The next day many policemen came.  They said that the people of Boipatong are blaming us.  We heard that the people of Boipatong wanted to attack us.  We went out to the robots to wait for them.  The police stopped us and we went back to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>	I cannot remember who gave instructions that the good should be burnt but the loot was burnt that night.  The goods that I took was also burnt.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I didn't hear the question quite properly, will you repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The question was, where did you meet him for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I only saw him at KwaMadala hostel.  He was still young then.  That was after the Boipatong massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> As far as you know was he part of the group that attacked Boipatong on the night of the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> No, I started knowing Matanzima after I was arrested for this Boipatong massacre.  That was the first time that I knew Matanzima.  I didn't know him when we attacked the people of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> He has made an affidavit and in that affidavit he states that before the attack on Boipatong a person by the name of Peens, a member of the Murder and Robbery Squad, came to the hostel and addressed the residents, do you have any knowledge of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Well I don't remember that because I didn't know Peens then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But before the attack, did a policeman come to the hostel and address the residents about an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> No, I have never seen a policeman there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You have already indicated that your name is also Ruben.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now in his affidavit he further states that on the night of the attack Caspirs met your group or Caspirs were part at a certain point and a person with the name of Ruben, together with Gachene, Themba Kubeka, Lucky, Sipho, Makuka, Tsamo(?), Dondo and Mkhize got into the Caspirs, do you know anything about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Well there is nothing like that.  That is untrue.  It's the first time that I hear about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> From the time that you left the hostel on the night of the attack until you came back, did you ever set foot in a caspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Whilst you were in Boipatong busy with the attack, did you see any white people that also formed part of the attack or of the attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I did not see any whites.  Even at our meeting after we have attacked, there were no whites.  I didn't see any white men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During the course of the attack did you see any military or police vehicles inside Boipatong?</p>

<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During the course of that night did you see any military vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> The army vehicle I saw was outside.  That is when we returned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you explain more or less where you saw that vehicle when you returned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I saw that army vehicle on the road that moves from Vanderbijl Park to Sebokeng.  It was       travelling along that road,  it was not inside Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know Themba Mabote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did he do anything in particular at the stage when the group left Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, Themba Mabote shot, but I was not aware who he was shooting, but I remember him shooting when we were outside Boipatong, on our return.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know a person by the name of Victor Keswa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know that his nickname in the Vaal Triangle was "The Vaal Monster"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was he a leader of a so-called "hit squad"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I now nothing about the hit squad.  I didn't know whether he was whether he was part of the group or a particular group know as "hit squad".</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you used to move with him and go out with him out of the hostel to various places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Well I don't remember being with Victor, even going to the town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So were you not a member of the hit squad yourself, of a hit squad?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I have never been a member of the hit squad.  It's the first time that I learn of hit squads, here at the TRC.  I've never been part of the hit squad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You've indicated already that you fired approximately 13 shots with your 9mm pistol in the township, and  you also said that you went into houses and fired shots there an also outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now if I show you map, Exhibit J, can you give an indication where you went into houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I'll do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The witness points to houses in Papedi Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>	Do you know how many houses you went into in Papedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Well I don't remember which houses I entered in Papedi but I remember in that street there are houses that I entered.  It might be between two or three houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And did you fire shots in the houses in Papedi Street which you went into?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now do you remember when you fired the shots, did you fire shots towards males, women, children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I shot everybody, everybody I come across in the house.  Whether it was a woman, a man or a child, I didn't care about that, I wanted to kill because my intention was to kill there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You also said that you've shot people but you cannot say that they died, do you still stand by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why don't you know if they died or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> After shooting a person I didn't go and look as to whether he is dead or not, I went on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now apart from the houses in Papedi Street, can you indicate on this map other houses where you went into?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> In this street I'm pointing to my lawyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The witness points to Sekukuni Street.  	Sekukuni Street is one street away from Slovo Park, did you go into Slovo Park at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you remember which route you followed from Sekukuni Street to get to the other side of Boipatong to leave the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I remember which road I followed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you just give an indication?  Just for the record, the witness points that he took Bafokeng Street and he stayed in Bafokeng Street right through Boipatong on his way to leave Boipatong.  The witness also pointed out certain houses towards the end of Bafokeng Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>	What do you want to say about them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> That is where I took the blankets and certain goods.  It's a yellow house and big windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Just for the record, the witness points to a ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> There's a yellow house, I don't know whether it's on this side or not but it's a yellow house with big windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The house numbers being pointed to is in the vicinity of 738 to 740, 742 and 744, in the vicinity of those four houses in Bafokeng Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>	Is that correct, that area there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What house numbers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The area he shows is 738, 740, 742 and 744, more or less that area there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>	Those houses, is that correct?  Is that the area there where the yellow house is to be found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, those are the houses where I took the property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is 738 here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> 738 is - let me explain it like this.  Bafokeng Street forms a corner there with Shlube Street, towards the end of the map on the left-hand side.  The house on the corner is 734, the next on is 736 and then 738, 740, 742.  So that's the general area the witness has pointed out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, okay.  Is that a place where there is a cross which is encircled in pink, at least on my Exhibit J?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I haven't got that on my map, my map has been used at the criminal trial and there are many other crosses, so I can't really verify that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, but what he is pointing - he's point out at the vicinity of the point where Bafokeng meets Shlube Street, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The point he points out is more to the right-hand side of the map.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But it is in that vicinity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Ja, in that vicinity, those houses in that vicinity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>	So those are the houses you took the property.  Did you leave after that in the direction of Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After you've left Boipatong and when you got back to the hostel, did you go back to the stadium or directly to your room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I went to my room first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I put the property that I brought with me and the gun that I had and I checked the bullets which were left and then I realised that I was left with only three bullets.  Then I took my gun and I put it in a safe place and then I slept after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Where did you hide your gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I hid this gun in a place which was used as a kitchen before.  That is where I hid my gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know Prince Vanana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was he part of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> No, he was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> According to your own personal knowledge, was he at the hostel at the time of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> No, he was not at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You've already testified that you know Victor Keswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was he there on the day of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> No, he was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know where he was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Victor Keswa was a person who was arrested from time to time.  He was once arrested under Article 3.  On many occasions the police would come and collect him.  Even when they meet him somewhere they would just take him and arrest him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Whilst you were in Boipatong, did you see that any person or any woman was raped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> No, I did not see anything.  The way the situation was then, it wouldn't be possible for me to see a person who was raping.  If I had seen somebody raping I would imagine that he is one of the people that we were going to attack because the people who were with me would not do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> One last aspect. You referred to groups, now whilst moving through Boipatong, did the specific groups stay together in a close formation, or can you explain the people's movement through the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> We spread ourselves in the township, we were not in groups.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You said that you were, as far as you can remember, with Mr Mkhize's group, when was he last time for you to see him after you've entered Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> The last time I saw him was when he said that we should divide into amabuto.  That was the last time that I saw him.  When we entered Boipatong and started fighting I didn't see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You said that you saw people firing shots, including Mr Mkhize, when did you see that he fired a shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> That is when we entered Boipatong.  That is the place where we saw the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You also said that Smith fired a shot, where did you see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Smith was always with me, shooting all the time.  I would kick the door and then he'll get in and start shooting and at some times he would kick the door and I would start shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And Sipho Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He had a "haelgeweer".</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Just to get back to Smith, what kind of weapon did he have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He had a shotgun, that is the gun he had with him.  That was his own gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is that the same as Sipho Buthelezi, a "haelgeweer"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I've already explained that Sipho Buthelezi had a "haelgeweer".</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Maybe I just heard wrongly.  I just want to get clarity.  Did he say a "short" or a "shotgun"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>	Smith's firearm, was it short gun or a shotgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> It was a small gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> .765, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And Sipho Lukozi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Sipho Lukozi had an AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When did he fire shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I met him in the township.  I don't know when he started shooting but I met him in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And Themba Mabote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He's one of the people that I met inside the township.  I met him inside the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Where did you see him firing a shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I saw him running but I could not see whether he was shooting somebody because the people he was shooting at were on the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you have any reason why you would protect the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I cannot protect the police or I'll never say anything about the police.  If they were there I would say that they were there because what I'm saying toady is the truth.  I'm telling the truth when I say the police were not there.  They did not help us.  They were not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>	If maybe people may say that they participated by helping with the plans, maybe I would agree because I was not involved during the planning stages but inside Boipatong I didn't see any policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> It is because at that time after the - because they were calling me Inkatha at that time, therefore I had to run to KwaMadala hostel because I had no place to run to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Was it safe at KwaMadala hostel if you were a member of Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, it was safe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Do you know who killed Victor Keswa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> We were both in prison.  I heard the following day when I was told by the police but I don't know who killed him.  I don't know who killed him but he died in the hands of the police.</p>

<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> When I arrived at KwaMadala I was left with three bullets, so that means I used 13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I have no further questions, thank you, Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DA SILVA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>	Mr Magubane, I understand your evidence to be that you only saw one military vehicle when you left Boipatong and crossed the road on the way to KwaMadala, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Can you estimate more or less what the time was when you saw this military vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you just hold on second, we just want to change the headphones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can you hear properly now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Is it possible to estimate the time more or less when you saw the military vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> It was at night.  I don't remember even the time when we returned from KwaMadala but it was at night.  I saw that vehicle when we were leaving Boipatong, on our way to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Mazibuko testified that he recalls vehicles approaching the group as the group was crossing the road and then the vehicle turned around and went away, is that your recollection of what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I don't remember seeing a vehicle turning back.  The vehicle that I saw was on its way from Vanderbijl Park in the direction of Sebokeng.  I never saw it turning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So I understand your evidence to be that this vehicle was moving away from the group, is that correct, when you saw it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I'm talking about the route from Vanderbijl Park that passes through the robots to Sebokeng, so that vehicle was facing the direction of Sebokeng.  I didn't see whether it turned at the robot or not because at the robots there is a cross, so there is a way that leads to KwaMadala and the other one to Cape Gate.  I did not recognise whether it turned there at that cross.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Is your evidence then that when you saw the vehicle it was in the vicinity of the robot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, it was not far from the robots.  I can see where this car was, it was easy for you to recognise somebody between that car and the robots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I don't have any further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DA SILVA</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Ms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION MS TANZER:</span> Mr Magubane, you say</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>that you met Nosenga, or you know Mr Nosenga from the hostel when he was young, can you tell us approximately when, at what period did you meet Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> After we got there, that is when I first met Nosenga.  I used to take him just like a small boy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well how old was he or how old did he appear to be to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I would say he was the same age of my younger brother who died in Boipatong.  So I took him as a child because he was the same age as my younger brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Were you part of the youth brigade before the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I was a member of the youth brigade before the attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Were you employed in any fashion before the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> No, I was unemployed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So in the period before the attack on Boipatong, would you just hang around the hostel?  What would you be doing all day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> There was nowhere to go.  What I used to do in the township, I could not longer do because I used to run the stockvels.  So it was not possible for me to do that at KwaMadala because at KwaMadala you would not do things that you used to do in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Do you remember seeing or noticing Mr Nosenga's face before the Boipatong attack, who was also hanging around the hostel during that period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So on your evidence the first time you really noticed him was after he was arrested for the Boipatong attack and was released on bail with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I say I saw him after I got back, when we were released from prison, then I met him at the hostel.  That is after we got the bail, not that I was with him in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So after you got bail did you return to the KwaMadala hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> There was no place I could go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So when you befriended him when you were released on bail, did you discuss with him the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I never talked to him, we never had any discussions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So what did you mean when you said you related to him like your brother, your younger brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Miss, he did not say that.  As I recall his evidence he says Nosenga was of the same age as his younger brother who was killed in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> As the Chairman pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>	In your evidence-in-chief you said you did not know a police known as Peens then, you emphasised the word "then", did you later know Peens, was he known to you at any stage after the Boipatong attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I knew him after the death of Getisi.  I knew him when Getisi was killed. That was the first time that I knew Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> How did you come to know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Peens took me from my room at the hostel.  He talked to me at the offices of the Murder and Robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>	He asked by about the things that were allegedly done by Getisi and his gangs.  He promised that he will buy me a house, I should co-operate with him so that they should get Getisi.  So I was talking to Peens and then thereafter I heard noise and that was the police, other police with Getisi.  They were coming in pushing Getisi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Getisi means Victor Keswa, that is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Now Mr Nosenga actually has made a statement in terms of which statement he states that there was a relationship between Victor Keswa and certain members of the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>	In fact he names a policemen with the surname of Peens, Shaka and Rooikop, but he specifically mentions in his statement that on the day of the attack he saw Peens coming to the hostels accompanied by his colleague Shaka.  He even says that Peens came to the hostel in his own motor vehicle which he describes as a white Opel Monza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>	He saw Peens hand money over to Mr Keswa.  He doesn't know how much money was handed over but he says that later in that day Victor Keswa confirmed to him that he had received money from the said Peens.  He even went on further to state that he often saw Peens meeting with Keswa and he was sure that he was getting some money from Peens.  What are your comments in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> What Nosenga is saying is, he is lying.  I don't think Nosenga could actually say anything to Getisi.  The way I knew Getisi he would not talk to a person like Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>	What I can say about Nosenga, he doesn't know Peens.  Even if we can show him Peens' photographs, he cannot point.  What's he's saying is pure lies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is it that he cannot identify from a photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I'm saying that Nosenga cannot point Peens because when I started knowing Nosenga he was still young.    He has never talked to Peens, he's lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> If Nosenga can give a description of Peens, Shaka and Rooikop, would you believe him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I won't agree, I will only agree when he says he knows them from the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Where else would he know them if not from the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From the township, not from the hostel, Ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> You have disputed that he could even describe Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I think so.  Even when I was arrested I did not see Matanzima, I only learnt when I was in his office that he is Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> If Matanzima can give evidence and describe Peens, would you believe what he is saying is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ma'am, let me ask you this.  It is not for this witness to believe or disbelieve Mr Nosenga, that is a decision which this Committee has to make.  I think the point has been made that insofar as this witness is concerned, he does not believe that Nosenga knows Peens and ...(indistinct).  I think you have made that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> As the Chairman pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>	I put it to you that like you, Matanzima Nosenga was unemployed, was also hanging around the hostel all day and as such was able to give the evidence, or to make such statements and was seeing the relationship that was occurring between Mr Keswa and various police officers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would that have been before the attack on Boipatong or after?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> That would be after the attack - that would be before the attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you hear the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Can you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well what's being put to you is that before the attack on Boipatong, Mr Nosenga was already at KwaMadala hostel, like you he was not employed, he was hanging out in the hostel.  That is why counsel is putting to you Nosenga is in a position to describe the events that he describes in his sworn statement.  The upshot of this is that Nosenga was in the hostel even before the attack  on Boipatong, what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He was not there, he was not at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> You deny that Nosenga was staying in the hostel in the period prior to the Boipatong attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I disagree with that statement because I began to know him after the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Can you describe how you began to know him?  How did he come to your attention after the attack, what made him noticeable to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> What made me know Matanzima after the attack, that was a knew face because he was speaking Sesotho so it was unusual in the hostel.  Because I heard him speak in Sesotho I realised that he's somebody from the township.  That is when I started enquiring about him and they explained to me, they said that this is Matanzima.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well I put it to you that Matanzima Nosenga was at the hostel prior to the attack.  In fact he joined the hostel during the 1991 period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> No, that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did you know every single member of the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Even though I did not know their names but we knew each other.  The person I would not know is a person maybe who has just arrived from KwaZulu Natal but I will know him after some few days.  But now I cannot give their names but at that time we knew each other well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Could you say you could identify every single person, at least by face, at the hostel prior to the attack or even after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> All the people who were staying at KwaMadala knew each other.  The only person who would not know is a person who has just arrived because if a person comes from Nongoma, the people who come from Msinga would not know that person but we will know him a few days after, or a person who comes from Sebokeng, they will give him a room. So I will not be able to know that person that day, but after some few days I will know the person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well I put it to you that Mr Nosenga was at the hostel and that he knew about you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I disagree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Mr Nosenga - I put this to you, in his statement verifies the meeting that took place two weeks before the attack on Boipatong.  He says that he was at the meeting where there were lots of people, both men and women.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>	Mr Nosenga said that at - this meeting was chaired by Themba Khosa and a member of the Murder and Robbery Squad in Flora Gardens, whom he calls Peens.  He said further, at this meeting other speeches were made, including those made by Mtwana Zulu, Darkie, someone known as Darkie who is a leader of the IFP, Gatchene who he identifies as an Induna at the hostel, and a person he calls Danie, whom he says was a member of the South African Police Force in Everton.  What are your comments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I am putting to him the version of the meeting, according to Mr Nosenga, on the 10th, who addressed the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Nosenga is lying.  When he's mentioning Themba Khosa and that meeting that he is mentioning, he is lying, he's just lying.  I can see that he is in trouble for what he did, that is why he is now trying to lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> What kind of trouble do you think he is in about what he did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He's worried about those years that he is doing in prison.  The reason why he is in prison is because he killed members of the IFP.  He was a member of the ANC.  He is not in prison because he killed members of the ANC, so now he is trying to use us to ask for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> From where are you obtaining this information may I ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I know because I was with him in prison.  He used to say  that while we were in Vereeniging Prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So you do know him from the prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I want you to understand when I explain to you, to know why he was imprisoned, I learnt of that in prison.  He was explaining to me, he was telling me what happened.  We were then in prison.  I was in prison for my own things as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Were you together at the prison, were you both prisoners at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ma'am, please.  There are certain things which are pretty obvious.  I mean, is there a suggestion that he was not prison at that point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well as I heard I'm sure he said that he met when they were released on bail at the hostel and that they did not have any discussions in prison.  That's how I understood it.  Perhaps I'm incorrect, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> His evidence is that he first became aware of Mr Nosenga upon his release from prison.  That is when he met him at the hostel.  And the reason why he stood out is because he spoke Sotho which was unusual at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>	What he is saying about the prison is that Nosenga told him when he was in prison what he had done.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I do understand that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you, Mr Magubane, at any stage be imprisoned together with Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I met him in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> It was late '92.  That is towards the end of 1993, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did Mr Nosenga tell you what the charges were or what was he convicted of that he was in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He was arrested for shoplifting or fighting in town.  He also told me that he shot people in Zone 13 while he was a member of the IFP.  After that now he will change his story and say he shot members of the IFP.  He said to me he was suspected for the murders in Zone 13.  He said it is alleged that he shot people together with Getisi, but he didn't tell me when he met Getisi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you met Nosenga in prison, that is towards the end of, in 1993, had you already met him at the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> The record will show that Mr Nosenga was in fact arrested and convicted for activities in respect of which he attacked Zone 12 and Sebokeng ANC members and not IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Can we come back to this meeting.  Mr Nosenga made a statement as a witness to this meeting on the 10th of June, that certain speeches were given in which they were told to kill the dogs and he even said that Themba Khosa said that a certain insect should be killed, referring to the Boipatong residents, saying because a certain IFP member was killed in the location, what are you comments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He's telling lies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> He further stated that the Indunas agreed with the words of Themba Khosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He's lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I put it to you that Mr Nosenga is going to give evidence that Mr Peens was present at the meeting and he was speaking Afrikaans which was translated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He's lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> He's further going to give evidence and state that Peens had agreed with the statements of Themba Khosa and he said that he would supply Caspirs near the Boipatong location, what are your comments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He's lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> It was further mentioned at the meeting that they would supply Rooikop, a policeman known as Rooikop, with weapons who will give it to Themba Khosa who will bring it to the hostel.  What are you comments there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> When you talk about Rooikop, I don't know him, I used to hear about him.  When I was still involved in housebreaking I used to hear about Rooikop.  He used to work together with Barnard.  So this Rooikop he's referring to I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> But what is interesting is that as per the statement of Mr Nosenga, weapons were delivered on the day of the 17th of June to the hostel, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Well I don't whether weapons were delivered on that day.  What I can say is that we used to donate as the community of the hostel, and buy weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>	If it happened, maybe it was something that was done by people who were in leadership.  The only thing that I know is that we will be called to a meeting and those people who were working will donate an amount of about R15,00 and that money will be used to buy weapons.  That is what I know.  And the person they trusted when it comes to weapons, was Damarra Chonco. </p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> But weapons were delivered on the day of the attack, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I can agree because I saw Damarra's car but whether they were from the car or from the rooms, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did you take - were you part of a meeting that took place on about the 14th of June, three days before the attack on Boipatong, when the decision to attack was taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> No, I was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well Mr Nosenga is going to give evidence that there was a meeting on the 14th of June and at that meeting the decision to attack Boipatong was taken and it was decided that everyone should be killed, including women and children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>	He further said that at this meeting they were given instructions, the "they" being the people at the meeting, to bring back the weapons they were being supplied with, after the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would that be at the meeting of the 14th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> That would be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So they were told at that meeting, to bring back the weapons that they had used in the attack, that they would use for the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> According to Mr Nosenga they were told they would be provided with weapons and when they returned, they must return the weapons, yes, back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> There's nothing that I know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> When the signal was sounded or the, on the evening of the 17th, did you go straight to the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that night I went to the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> And as you gave evidence, when you became aware that you were going to attack Boipatong, did you drink ndelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, I drank ndelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> How did the ndelezi make you feel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> There was never a change in me.  Everything that I did I was aware of what I was doing, and I was aware of the place I was at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Mr Nosenga states and he's going to give evidence to this Committee, that he arrived at the stadium, he drank ndelezi, it made him feel strong, and he was given an AK47 which he used on the attack in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He's lying when he says ndelezi makes him feel strong, he's lying.  When he says that it made him strong and brave to kill the people of Boipatong, he's lying.  The only thing that I can say is that when I drank ndelezi and you shoot at me, you will never shoot at me, you won't be able to shoot at me.  That is what I know about ndelezi.  It works.  I have proved that it works.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I didn't quite get that, can you explain that again?  How does ndelezi work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well he says what he knows is that if he has drunk ndelezi, you can't shoot at him.  Right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> Yes, that's correct.  You'll never shoot at me after drinking ndelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> The previous applicants we heard so far said they all drank ndelezi that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, they said that, so what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Mr Nosenga is going to give evidence and states that after leaving the stadium with the weapons, you actually, you pass under a bridge in leaving the hostel and you arrived at a big open field before the township, where he saw about four to six Caspirs.  He describes them as yellow in colour.  What is your comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He's lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> According to Mr Nosenga, the policemen were wearing civilian clothes, he entered into a Caspir, together in the Caspir was Gatchene, Ruben, who I expect is you, Themba Kubeka, Lucky, Sipho, Makuka, Samo, Dondo and Mkhize.  He further states that Themba Khosa did not take part in the attack, what are your comments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> He is lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well Mr Nosenga states that he saw the Caspirs moving through the streets as the hostel residents were attacking the people of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> In all his stories I can say that he is trying to smear himself with fats of which he did not eat the meat.  He is trying to ask for forgiveness and apologising to ANC by claiming that he did what he did for IFP.  We did what we did because we knew that the police were not there.  I know that it's me that did that, not the police, not what he is saying.  What he is saying, he is lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well this is the evidence that Mr Nosenga is going to give and it is my duty to put his evidence to you and to get  your response which we are hearing so unambiguously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see Ma'am, I understand your obligation but I think at some point you have to consider what is the value of going through the entire statement when the witness denies categorically, firstly that Nosenga was at the hostel at all and that he took part in the attack.  I'm not saying don't put it but you know, once a witness says this man is lying, he was never there, putting everything that he said which he is going to deny in any event.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I hear what you say, Mr Chairman, but ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But if there are matters that you feel very strongly about and ought to be put to the witness, by all means do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Don't you think it's rather unusual that Mr Nosenga gives a vivid account of that night and besides the police presence there are similarities in the events that he describes and events that the other applicants describe on the night of the 17th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And there are dissimilarities as well, fundamental differences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I'm referring to the similarities now, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For you to put the complete - you've got to put the complete picture to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>	You see what counsel is asking you is the following, and this now relates to everything that Nosenga is saying in his sworn statement:  You say that he was never at the hostel prior to the attack and he was never part of the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, now what's being put to you is, in his affidavit he talks about some of the incidents which occurred at the hostel which everyone knows they did occur and he also talks about going to Boipatong and launching an attack there.  If he was never at the hostel and was never part of the attack, how then would he have had information often concerning these events that he had described?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>	Is that more or less what you want to put to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I couldn't put it more succinctly myself, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> I don't know where he heard about these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> My final question to you then is, did you attend a rally in Ulundi about a month after the Boipatong attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGUBANE:</span> No, I have never attended a rally at Ulundi.  I know Ulundi.  I went to a rally in Ulundi when Mr Mandela wanted to meet Mr Buthelezi.  That is when that date was postponed and then he said to us we should go and meet there, not at Ulundi because there were allegations and rumours that he'll be killed.  That was the first time that I went to Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Thank you, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS TANZER</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger?  The time now is about twenty to six, would this be convenient to take an adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It would, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did we agree on half past eight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I think we just have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well, we will now adjourn and we'll start at half past eight tomorrow morning.</p>
