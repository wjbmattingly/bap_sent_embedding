<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS TANZER:</span> You say that you met Mr Nosenga after the attack on Boipatong, what was noticeable about Mr Nosenga that you remember him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> The reason for me to remember Matanzima, we were sitting at the hostel playing some game called Mlabalala, a guy called Vusi and Spongulwana.  They were washing the cars and they said there was a young man who was speaking Sotho, and I enquired what is it that he was saying there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>	They called us to come and listen to him.  We went to that place.  When we arrived there they communicated in Sotho with him.  They later interpreted to us, they told us that he said he was sent there by the ANC to enquire as how to plant the bombs inside the hostel ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you please just slow down so that we can make some notes.  What are the names of these boys that you say came to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It was Vusi and Spongulwana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Myself and the others took him from that place ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, I didn't catch the name of the person, you said someone and others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Which person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Maybe you said I, it just cut off on the interpretation.  Just repeat your answer please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I said two gentlemen came, Vusi and Pongulwana.  They came as we were playing a game.  They came to tell us that there was a young man from the township who was there at the place where the two gentlemen were washing the cars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>	We asked them what was he saying, what was it that the young man was saying.  They did not tell us anything but they said we must come with them to listen to this gentleman.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>	We went to that place and they asked him questions in Sotho and they later interpreted to us because we did not understand the Sotho language.  He said he was sent by the African National Congress to come and inspect the place inside the hostel, as to how he can plant the bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>	We later took him - we then took him to the IFP Committee.  We handed them over to that committee.  They communicated with him and we left him there.  After some time we heard that he admitted to everything that was said by the two gentlemen.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>	Fortunately he came at a time where there was going to be a conference in Ulundi.  He was then taken - the people who were going to the conference took him with to Ulundi to the conference.  The matters was reported, the others were told about him.  I was not there at that conference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>	They brought him back again.  He stayed there inside the hostel.  As to when did he leave the hostel I do not know.  He was still young at the time and when I saw him here he was a bit older.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You mentioned that you took him to the committee of the IFP in the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who in particular did you take him to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It was Thembankosi Khumalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> To you your knowledge, Mr Dlamini, was Mr Nosenga only to talk Sotho, was he unable to communicate with yourselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well I put it to you that his Zulu is as good as your Zulu, that he will give evidence in Zulu and that he's not even a Sotho-speaking person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I don't know about that, you know about that.  All I know is that he was speaking Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Are you perhaps not mixing up Mr Nosenga with somebody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.  I can see clearly and my mind works very well.  I know that he is the person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well what do you say about the fact that he can talk Zulu so fluently, that in fact he's communicating with the interpreters in Zulu and not in Sotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well he's just answered you and he says he is not aware that he can speak Zulu as good as he does.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Mr Dlamini, you've heard the evidence of your co-applicants so far, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> You've been present throughout these proceedings, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, it's only on the 18th where I was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> You've heard me put Mr Nosenga's version to the other co-applicants regarding the events that led to the attack and the attack itself, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I heard you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Do you stand then by your denial that Mr Nosenga resided at the hostel prior to the attack and took, and participated in the attack on the night of the 17th of June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I deny that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So it is not necessary for me to put to you Mr Nosenga's version, you remember the version and you deny it in its entirety, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Can you tell me, what motive would you impugn upon Mr Nosenga for placing himself at the hostel when he was not at the hostel or for participating in the attack, when you claim he did not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I think this person is lying.  He is a bit confused because of the sentence that he is serving.  He's saying things that did not happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I put it to you that insofar as Mr Nosenga's evidence contradicts yours, you are the person who is lying and Mr Nosenga is being open and honest with this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I am not lying, I'm saying he is the one who is telling the lie.  Where - you are representing him, that is why you are saying I am lying.  I am saying he is the one who is telling a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I further put it to you that Mr Nosenga was at the Kwamadala hostel prior to the attack, that he did take part in the attack and that you and your co-applicants are for some reason covering up his existence at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> The way you talk it looks like you were staying there at Kwamadala hostel, then it means in that case I was not staying there.  You were the one who was staying there, because I'm telling you that Nosenga was not there and you insist that Nosenga was there.  It looks like you are the one who was staying at Kwamadala hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think, Mr Dlamini, what is intended to be put to you is that according to Matanzima Nosenga, he was staying at the hostel prior to the attack and that he was part of the attack, you've denied that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I dispute that, he was not there and he was not present during the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did you see any police presence in Boipatong on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He has answered that question, he said "no".</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS TANZER</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You gave instructions that stolen items be burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that was the instruction that I was given by Damarra.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you steal any good from Boipatong on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>	Mr Dlamini, I take it that the meeting or the conference that was in Ulundi, where Mr Nosenga was brought to, was the annual conference of the IFP, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And that annual conference is the one that is held in July's annually, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And that is the very conference which was held after the Boipatong attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> You say you were not there at the conference, you don't know what happened there, do you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I was not there, I did not go to the conference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Do you know what was said in the conference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I do not know because I was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, when Nosenga was speaking to you about his intention to plant bombs, did he tell you that he was present during the attack at Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, he never mentioned that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did you find out from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, we knew that he was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> How did you know that he was not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> He came after the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> How do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I've already mentioned that I was there at Kwamadala hostel.  Though I cannot be very sure about the month, I was still there, I was not yet arrested.  The other co-applicants were already arrested at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No, Sir, what I want to be clear on is, you did not see Nosenga when he was arriving at the hostel, you were only told that there is a boy, or there is a  young man by the  name of Nosenga who says this and that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I was told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is being put to you is, do you know precisely when Nosenga arrived at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> He came on that particular day when these two gentlemen called us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I have no further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>	Mr Dlamini, when Mr Nosenga told you and the many people who were you, that he had been sent by the ANC to plant bombs in Kwamadala hostel, I understand from your evidence that he was giving you this information freely and voluntarily, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I cannot say whether he was free to tell us because I was not the first person to see, he started speaking to these other guys.  I just saw him for a very shot time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you were there ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Wait a minute.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>	Did you just say that he appeared as if he was not mentally sane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> He looked shocked, he seemed very shocked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please speak close so that the interpreter can interpret everything, because some of the things the interpreter is not interpreting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Nobody was threatening Mr Nosenga, nobody was doing anything to Mr Nosenga to make him talk, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> When I was there nothing happened.  I don't know before that but when I was there with him nothing like that happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then after he had made this startling confession he was taken to the senior committee of the IFP in the hostel, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he was left there in the hands of the senior committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Besides Mr Thembankosi Khumalo, who else was present when Mr Nosenga was left there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Thembankosi was in his house, there were other people in his house.  He took him to the committee and I was not there at the time, but as we were taking him there, Thembankosi was in his house with his inmates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So when you said in your evidence earlier</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>"We took Nosenga to the IFP Committee."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>That's not correct, is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, you took Mr Nosenga to Mr Khumalo, Mr Khumalo took Mr Nosenga to his committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, Khumalo himself was the member of the committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, how long after that was Mr Nosenga taken to Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Though I cannot remember very well, that took place some time ago.  I think it was about a week or two and he was taken there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So what happened for that one or two-week period, between the time after Mr Nosenga was taken to Mr Khumalo and the time that he was taken to Ulundi, what happened to Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Nothing happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see him during that one or two-week period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I saw him inside the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Walking around freely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I used to see him sitting in front of one room that was occupied by the group from the township.  Most of the times he would be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He was associating with other people in the hostel quite freely during that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I can say so because he was staying with us inside the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that the treatment that was usually meted out to ANC spies, they were accommodated in the hostel and allowed to move around freely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> If the person would be there among us and be free, we would give him accommodation but if he would try to hide himself, we wouldn't help him by giving accommodation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At that stage you and none of the other hostel residents, besides the senior committee, knew what was going to happen to Mr Nosenga, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, we knew nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How do you know he was taken to Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> A meeting was convened just before the trip to Ulundi and it was mentioned that he would be leaving with the people going to Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who mentioned that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It was Mr Khumalo, Thembankosi Khumalo.  He told us that this man would be taken with to Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was this a meeting held in the stadium, a meeting of all the residents of the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So there would have been hundreds and hundreds of people present when the announcement was made that Mr Nosenga is being taken to Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, there was a large number of people when the meeting was held.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was Mr Mkhize at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I've already mentioned that my co-applicants were already arrested, he knows nothing about Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So the answer is, Mr Mkhize was not at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> He was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was Prince Vanana Zulu at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How long had Mr Nosenga been at the hostel before he was taken to Mr Khumalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I cannot lie, I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I cannot even estimate, I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga must have, on your version, must have come to the hostel almost immediately after the Boipatong attack, would that be right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So would you say that is was public knowledge, everyone at the hostel knew Mr Nosenga, and everyone knew that Mr Nosenga was a man who had been sent by the ANC to plant bombs in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Other people who were with me in the hostel knew, except the people who were already arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What did Mr Khumalo say at that meeting was going to happen to Mr Nosenga in Ulundi, why was he being taken to Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Though he did not mention the reason, he first mentioned something about the truth, the truth that would be taken.  And he later mentioned that even this young man who was there to plant the bombs would be taken with to Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga wasn't going to conference as a delegate I take it, he was going to conference as an exhibit, am I right?  He was going to be presented to the leaders at conference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I think he was there as an exhibit from Kwamadala hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As an ANC spy who had been sent by the ANC to blow up the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And this conference in Ulundi was addressed by the top leadership of the IFP at the time, am I right, including Chief Mangasotho Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Though I was not there, I think it was like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Can you explain why Chief Buthelezi has said in the media that he knows nothing about this Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Are you talking about the Buthelezi in the Committee or someone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, Mr Berger, the man wasn't at the meeting, how can he explain anything about what might have happened in Mr Buthelezi's mind or why he would deny something?  He doesn't know whether the man was actually presented to him or not, it's not a fair question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Mr Lax, I will rephrase the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>	Who else besides Mr Khumalo and Mr Nosenga went to the conference at Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Will you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm talking about the delegation from ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What you are being asked is, apart from Nosenga and Mr Khumalo, who else went to Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> The people who went to the conference, I heard that it was Vincent Khanyile, Vincent Khanyile was one of them and Prince Zulu was one of them too, Bazuka and the others, quite a number of people although I cannot remember the other names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well I'd like you to think hard about who the people were who went to Ulundi.  You were at a meeting ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, do you want him to give us all the names of the persons who went to Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you recall the names of all the person who went to Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> From Kwamadala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I've already said that I cannot remember the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Are there any of the people who are your co-applicants here, who went to Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, it is Vincent Khanyile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Is he the only one amongst the co-applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, among my co-applicants he is the only one that I know did go to Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Besides your co-applicants - well, are you saying that all your co-applicants besides Mr Vincent Khanyile were arrested at the time of the Ulundi conference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, there are others with whom I was arrested.  We were arrested in groups, we were not arrested all at once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well let me ask you about Qambelani Buthelezi, Bhekinkosi Mkhize and Victor Mthembu, had they all been arrested by the time of the Ulundi conference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Buthelezi was already arrested, Mkhize as well, Victor was arrested together with myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Victor Mthembu never went to Ulundi to the conference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I cannot remember very well as to whether he attended the conference or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then after the conference, Mr Nosenga was brought back to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what report-back did you receive from Mr Khumalo or any other delegate to the conference, as to what had happened in Ulundi in relation to Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> They did not tell me anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was the status then of Mr Nosenga?  Here was a man who had come to plant bombs in the hostel, the allegation was important enough for him to be taken off to Ulundi to the national conference, this had been announced at a public meeting in the stadium, and he comes back to the hostel and there is no report-back to the hostel dwellers about what has been decided to be done with Mr Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It might as well be that something was said in my absence.  Yes, that is possible, something may have been said to the residents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well didn't you ask anyone about what happened to Nosenga in Ulundi, or what is his status now in the hostel, what are we to do with him?  Did you ask anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I did not ask anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were just happy to have him back in the hostel and he walked around freely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I just looked at him as one of the residents at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I put it to you, Mr Dlamini, that your version about Mr Nosenga saying that he came to the hostel to plant bombs is absolute nonsense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I know that to be the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you made your application for amnesty at page 211, 12 and 13, were you in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This was February 1998.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were taken to the police station in Vereeniging to have your application attested, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you were accompanied by Mr Nana Tshabangu who acted as your interpreter, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You have confirmed that the documents at pages 214 and 215 have been read to you and translated to you and you agree with the contents of those two pages, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In that document you say, or you agree with the statement which says that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>"The attack was a warning to ANC supporters in Boipatong, not to support the Self Defence Units."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The idea, you say, was to intimidate the residents of Boipatong in the same way as  you had been intimidated, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How were you going to intimidate the residents of Boipatong?  How were you going to achieve that in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> To intimidate them would mean attacking them, nothing else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also say that the political purpose of the attack on Boipatong was to teach Boipatong a lesson.  How were you going to teach Boipatong a lesson, what were  you going to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> The lesson is beating them up, nothing else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So who were you going to beat up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> The comrades.  Some fled but we managed to get hold of others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But how were you going to teach the residents of Boipatong a lesson.  Leave aside the comrades, how were you going to teach the residents a lesson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Those who had not been attacked have learnt a lesson to the effect that we can beat them up, that is the lesson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So the purpose of the attack on Boipatong was to beat up all the residents of Boipatong, or as many of the residents as you could lay your hands on, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That was not the case.  It so happened but that was not the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So the purpose was only to attack the Self Defence Units, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And by attacking the Self Defence Units, you were going to teach the people of Boipatong a lesson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And this was your instruction before you left the hostel, only attack the Self Defence Units, we are not going to attack the people of Boipatong, that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Even though that was not expressed as such, but I thought that when we went there we were looking for the boys who were burning people in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well then how was it expressed at the meeting before you left, what were your instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> At the meeting on the 17th if was said that the day has arrived, let us go now to Boipatong.  Each one of us men were ordered to go and fetch our weapons, such as knopkierries.  I was already armed.  Only a few went back to their rooms, but most of them had already armed themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You did not attend any meeting prior to the 17th, at which the possibility of an attack on anybody, whether in Boipatong or anywhere else, was discussed, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I did not attend any such meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There was no meeting at which you were present, where there was talk of attack at all, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And yet when the siren went off on the 17th of June 1992, you knew to go to the stadium with your weapon, why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I want you to understand this very well, Mr Berger, when this siren went off I was in another room where we were drinking and when I left on my way to the stadium I came across Kwesele Zingene(?) and he said I should go back to my room and arm myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who said that to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It Kwesele Zingene Keswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the other residents who came, you don't know why they came out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> On leaving their rooms, they were responding to the siren that was summoning us to the stadium, to the arena.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So there was nothing said at the meeting of the 17th, about attacking the Self Defence Units, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I didn't hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now you say you entered Boipatong, and I'm reading from your affidavit at page 222, and you were chasing the SDUs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>"They ran away and one ran into a house.  There was a man who tried to run away and I stabbed him with a spear.  That man jumped over a fence and he disappeared."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>Now that man, was he an SDU member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Even though I would not be certain what he was, but I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So he was a young man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct, he was a youth but he was not young.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That's the first man you stabbed, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>"We continued.  We got into a house.  Themba was with me and there were children there who were crying."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>Is that Themba Mabote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>MR BERGER</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>"I asked the child: 'where are your parents'?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was that two young children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I saw only one, not two children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you said the children were crying, you say there was more than one child, so how many children were crying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Maybe you did not get me well, I did not say they were crying in this house, I am saying they were crying in houses.  In the house that I entered I only found one child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Dlamini, please listen to what you have confirmed under oath and confirmed again this morning. 	After this man has jumped over the fence and disappeared, this is what you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>"We continued.  We got into a house.  Themba was with me.  Children were crying there.  I asked the child: "where is your parents'?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct, I did ask where the parents were but I was asking one child.  Maybe you do not understand me quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you say the children were not crying in that house, they were crying somewhere else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>"Boom, boom."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What does that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is a person's name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that the name of Thembiso Kubeka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Sthembiso Kubeka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that is applicant number 18.  He's one of your co-applicants, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is he present today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, he is present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>MR BERGER</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>"He then stabbed the child with a spear."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>Am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you asked the child: "where are your parents?", and before the child could answer, Sthembiso Kubeka stabbed the child with a spear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was the child a boy or a girl?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I think it was a boy if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> About how old?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I don't want to attempt to lie, he was this high.  I cannot tell his age.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You indicate a very small child, a very small boy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Less than a metre high.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I don't anything about metres, I don't want to tell you a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm just confirming what you've indicated in Court.  Where did Sthembiso Kubeka stab this child, where on his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I think he stabbed him at the back because the child was facing me.  I think it was somewhere behind his back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How many times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I think it was once because when he stabbed him once the child cried and I fled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you go on - well, let me ask you, you couldn't have thought that this child was a member of an SDU, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I did not think it like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So there was absolutely no reason for this child to be stabbed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, there was no reason.  Had I thought about that, it would have been me who stabbed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It was a child.  I was not stabbing children that young, I wanted all the people, the ones who were troublesome, burning people around, not children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you say anything to Sthembiso Kubeka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I did not say anything, there was no time for conversations really, we were in a hurry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you try to stop him?  The child was between you and him, he was behind the child, you were in front of the child, you saw him lift up the spear, did you try and stop him from stabbing the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I was talking to the child on my knees, I only heard the child crying and when I raised my head I saw this spear being pulled from the child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You actually saw the spear being pulled out of the child by Sthembiso Kubeka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you go on</p>

<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> According to your statement you stabbed two people, according to your evidence before this Committee you say you stabbed about four people, why didn't you mention the other two in your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Maybe the person who was interpreting did not get me well.  I said, when we left the house in which we found the child, we found other people who were fleeing and we pursued them right into a certain house with a shack.  We opened the shack and we stabbed them inside the shack.  I don't know whether this is not written there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How many people did you stab in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I estimated them to be four or five.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you involved in any incident of violence concerning the people of Boipatong, before the attack of the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So the people of Boipatong had not done anything to you personally, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> ...(no English translation).</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> We're not getting any interpretation but he in fact saying that Mr Berger's speaking the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> I'm trying to rectify a mistake on the part of the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you had no family living in Boipatong, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So what then was your motive in participating in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> My motive was that the people from Boipatong had already killed our people and I too was not free to go to Boipatong to the shops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you able to point or to give the name of any person who was killed in Boipatong between January and June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Mr Berger, is it not common cause that people were killed in Boipatong and that was common knowledge to the people of Kwamadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's common cause, Advocate Sigodi, that a person was killed in Boipatong in January of 1992 and again on the 13th of June 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And that was common knowledge.  I mean, isn't that evidence that we've been hearing so far, in that the people in Kwamadala hostel could not go to Boipatong, and there was this tension between the Kwamadala hostel ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If it's as I've stated, yes, that is common cause.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But we've been hearing evidence about people being killed every day, day by day and that is definitely not common cause.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Advocate Sigodi is trying to put across to you is that there is no ...(indistinct), we now know, that two people were killed just shortly before the attack.  We know that the residents of the hostel could not go to Boipatong, we know there was animosity, that is common cause.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That is common cause.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do we have to hear more about that?  The record speaks for itself in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I take your point, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>	So when you said in your evidence-in-chief:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>"Even our relatives there were harassed."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>... you were not speaking about your relatives, am I</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would you agree with the evidence from one of your co-applicants, that the real problems were in townships such as Sharpeville and Sebokeng and that Boipatong was chosen as a target for the attack because it was closer, in fact very close to Kwamadala hostel, in stead of Sharpeville or Boipatong?  Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, because Boipatong was nearer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you say that your job was to stab the people, who gave you that job?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I took it upon myself.  Isn't it I had a spear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were asked a question about who you saw firing and you answered that there were two people whom you saw, the one was Damarra and the other one was Themba Mabote, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why is it that every time an applicant is asked: "Who did you see shooting?", the answer is always Damarra Chonco and Themba Mabote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> As far as I have concerned, I am talking about a person that I saw shooting.  I saw this personally, this is not a hearsay.  I saw Themba Mabote shooting.  I was with him right inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You've all been sitting here every day listening to the evidence, that you've moulded your versions so that they all say the same thing, you all say the same thing about what happened in Boipatong, who you saw shooting, haven't you discussed it with your co-applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, we did not discuss this at all.  I am talking here about people that I accompanied, people that I saw shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, is that a fair statement to put to this witness, if you have regard to his affidavit which was made before this hearing started, the further particulars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, it's not only in this hearing ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) suggesting to him is that he's mentioning these two people because he's been sitting here, and yet is appears in his statement and it also appears in his affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And it also appears in the statements and affidavits of his co-applicants.  It's not only that sitting here, but ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then you must put that specific point to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it correct that you and your co-applicants have conspired to put as far as possible a consistent version before this Committee, both in your applications and in your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is not the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Have you discussed your version at any stage with any of your co-applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it so that the Keswa that you referred to at page 222 is indeed Mr Victor Keswa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I did say that is an older man whose name Xhoslele Zingene from Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Dlamini, if there had been military vehicles or police vehicles in Boipatong during the attack, would you have seen them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You would not have missed them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when you left Boipatong after the attack, is it correct that you congregated in the field outside Boipatong, between Boipatong and the main road, Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, we did not gather on our way out, we were following one another.  We were walking hastily in groups, one group was ahead of another etc., etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you with Themba Mabote when you left Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, he was no longer with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you at the front of the attackers leaving Boipatong, were you in the middle or were you one of the last stragglers to leave Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I was in the middle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, in your application at page 212, you were asked for the names of your victims and you gave the name there</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>"Nonjoli"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I see that but I don't know anything about that.  I would not attack a stranger and later on come up with a name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, where does that name come from if not from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I have no idea.  I do not know Boipatong. I was going to Boipatong for the first time, who can I know the people when I don't know the place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you confirmed this document this morning, you made certain changes to the document, you corrected certain mistakes but you didn't correct this one, so you confirmed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It might as well be that my lawyer did not read this one to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well as I read the applications, you are the only applicant to put a name here, you are the only person to mention a name of a victim.  It has to come from you, Mr Dlamini, it couldn't come from anybody else.  You gave this name when you made your application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I have already pointed out that I know nothing about this name.  My attorney did not even refer to this name in the morning.  I would have indicated this to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you can't explain where this name comes from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I am not in the position to.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>MR BERGER:   In the criminal trial you gave evidence, and at page 3529 the following question was put to you:  "Mr Moloi has given evidence that you were in Boipatong and that you had a self-made spear with you and that you were in a certain house in Shlube Street, number 765, where you stabbed a person with a spear."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>What do you say about that?  And your answer was:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>"No, he is making a mistake."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I remember saying this in Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But Moloi was not making a mistake, was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> He was making a mistake.  I cannot make a spear, I did not make that spear, I buy a spear, I bought that one.  I do not even know the house that he is talking about.  I don't know what house it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well he was correct, you were in Boipatong, you did have a spear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct, yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you did enter a house in Shlube Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I have already pointed out that I went into two houses, one of which had a shack and the other one is the one house in which I found a child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You did enter a house in Shlube Street, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I would not admit because I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Interpreter he said he won't agree where the house is because he doesn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I put it to you that entered a house in the vicinity of Shlube Street, are you denying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I do not deny that, I am saying I don't know, I don't know which house you are talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well let me read to  you what you say in your affidavit at the bottom of page 222</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>"I stabbed another person, a man, with a spear in the vicinity of Shlube Street."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>You say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I would not bind myself to Shlube Street, I have already indicated that I do not know the place.  I cannot say I stabbed a person at such a place, knowing full well that I am not familiar with the place.  Yes, I agree, I stabbed a person at a particular place but I am not quite conversant with the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So where does this name Shlube Street come from, if not from you, in your own statement?  Is that another mistake that you forgot to point out this morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I don't know where it comes from.  I don't know really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In fact I read this sentence to you a little while ago, you didn't mention that it was wrong at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Maybe you did not get me well.  When I say I don't know a place, really I don't know how to go about explaining it to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You've got no explanation for how this comes to be in your statement, have you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, the point has been made.  The record speaks for itself.  He stabbed a man in one of the houses and he stabbed four or five others in a shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That's not my point, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Berger, the point is made with regard to his statement and the mistakes.  Really, we don't have to keep - it's emphasised sufficiently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If I can just round it off with this point, and that is</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>	At 765 Shlube Street, Mrs Martha Nonjoli, the name you mentioned, was indeed shot and killed and two minor children, Ndo, Ntombifekele were hacked and killed.  And aren't you responsible for that, Mr Dlamini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I still maintain what I was saying.  I know nothing about the names that appear here.  I will continue maintaining that I know nothing about these names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What happened at the hostel on the 18th of June 1992?  You woke up by - you were woken by Damarra Chonco, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He told you to go around and get people to burn the goods which they had stolen from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you alone when you went from room to room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I was alone indeed on my side, I did not see anyone else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were not with Mr Mkhize, you were not with Mr Matan(?)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And did people listen to you, did they obey your instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I would say they did because I was walking around calling upon people to bring along their stolen property or the stolen loot from Boipatong so that this could be put in the fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was your position in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was your position in the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Nothing, I was just a member, I had no position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was Damarra Chonco's position in the hostel or the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I knew him to be Mkhize's assistant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> After you had organised the burning of the goods, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Nothing happened, I then went back to my room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So according to you there was no meeting in the hostel on the 18th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> As far as I know I think there was a meeting yes, later on in the day, a meeting which was attended by Mr Khosa and Ndlovu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So Mr Khosa and Mr Ndlovu did come to the hostel on the 18th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Mr Khosa did not tell the residents to burn the goods because they'd already been burnt by that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, while you're looking, Mr Berger ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>	Did you - I just didn't hear clearly, there was a bit of interference at the back here, did you go to that meeting on the 18th or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I did not attend the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Oh!.  Why did you not attend that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I was busy cooking porridge in my room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Mr Dlamini, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, there's still some people ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have any questions, Mr Malindi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, maybe I have one question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MALINDI:</span> Mr Dlamini, am I right that you broke many windows while going through Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I did not break windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did you see any of the attackers breaking windows?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, even though I could not make out who exactly it was but I did hear windows shattering.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And when Mr Qambelani Buthelezi gave evidence he said when people have been cleared at the gate, if they happen to be young people they would be referred to him directly, and if I remember well he was giving this evidence to show that Nosenga was not referred to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I agree with Buthelezi because he was in charge of the youth.  They used to go to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> The point I'm trying to make is that if that was the practice then you would not have heard of Nosenga incidentally from some boys, saying here is this person, Mr Buthelezi should have been the one to hear about him first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And it was not Mr Qambelani Buthelezi who alerted the residents of the presence of Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, he was not around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MALINDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you, Chair.  	Sir, at the time that you moved into Kwamadala hostel in 1990, were you a member of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR CAMBANIS:</span> And at the time of the attack in June '92, you were acquainted with the policies of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> May the question please be repeated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR CAMBANIS:</span> At the time of the attack it's fair to say that you were well acquainted with the policies of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I did not know the policies, I was just a follower, I did not know the policies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Sir, you had been a member since - when did you become a member of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> If I am not mistaken I think it was in 1990, at the eruption of the violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> You've heard here that it was not within the police of the IFP that a massacre of this nature be launched, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I did hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And you knew that yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Are you aware of the fact that the national leader of the IFP had during the course of last week distanced himself from this attack, expressing himself as not condoning this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I think I did not hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Are you aware of the fact that the regional leader, Mr Themba Khosa has disassociated himself from this attack in not condoning this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I think I heard that yesterday during testimony here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS CAMBANIS</p>

<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>	During consultations with me, did I show you this map?  That is Exhibit J.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, you did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you point out certain areas to me, about the route and where certain things happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, you did.</p>

<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>	Mr Dlamini, I heard you saying you saw Kubeka stabbing this child in the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> I look at Dlamini's application and he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>"I didn't kill anybody but I threw a burning tyre into one of the houses."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, Mr Sibanyoni, you said Mr Dlamini's application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Kubeka in his application denies hurting anybody, killing anybody.  He says he only threw a tyre in one of the houses and he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>"I never entered houses."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>Why do you think he denies that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> He might be mistaken because I saw him.  He too knows that very well, that I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So you are saying he stabbed and also he entered into a house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You are not able to say how the names Nonjoli as well Shlube Street came into your documents, into your affidavit, you never gave those names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> The young man you knew, did you know that person as Matanzima or you also knew the name, Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I did not know him, I only knew him as Matanzima, not with any other name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> I also heard you saying the person was young and you were surprised now that he's a sort of a grown up person.  Was the person far younger than yourself, the person you knew as Matanzima?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I am an old man, he is a baby.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So would you say the person you saw now at this hearing, is he a baby a far as you are concerned, compared to your age?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> He is a baby, save to say he is now bigger, he looks like a man but yes, I can see he's now a little bit bigger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> If you say he looks like a man, are you saying he's almost your age?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, not at all, not with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, no further questions, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.   Is there anything arising?</p>
