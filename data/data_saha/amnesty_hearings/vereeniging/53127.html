<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, the next applicant I intend calling is Sipho Buthelezi, but I ask for the matter to stand down for a short time.  I must still consult with him and just go through his affidavits.  Unfortunately he was not here yesterday.   He phoned my attorney and gave an explanation why he could not be here, but I see he is here today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	I didn't say that I'm going to call him, I said Paulos Mbatha but I think I'll also call Paulos Mbatha probably later today, so he will still be called.  I ask for a short adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How much?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Twenty minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, Mr Strydom, is there any reason why you have not consulted with your client?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I've consulted with all my clients but just to make it more convenient for the Committee, I must go through their statements before they testify, just to get clarity on each and every aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>	I would submit that it shortens the proceedings if I can go through with the interpreter before he testifies, just before the witness testifies.  I've used all the other adjournments during lunch breaks to do consultations up till now, but things went a bit quicker today, so I'm in a bit of trouble at this stage so I will ask for a short adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you consulted?  You are now left with Sipho Buthelezi is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, Sipho Buthelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sibongeleni Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mkhize I must inform the Committee is not present.  I don't about his whereabouts, neither does my attorney.  He hasn't been present since the beginning of this session.  He's never been here, he never came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, is the applicant who said will be dealt with at the close of things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I indicated at the beginning that he was not present, he never arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So the outstanding ones are Sipho Buthelezi, Mbatha and then Kubeka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, okay.  Have you consulted with Mr Mbatha on the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, on a previous occasion but not today or yesterday, so I would like a short adjournment to consult with him as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  Mr Kubeka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I've consulted with him on the last occasion, I took his statement.  That was during the course of these hearings but not again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> A request, can the matter stand down for lunch now till 2 o'clock and then I can consult with three of them then I don't need any further time for any consultations after that?  I can consult with the three of them together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's what we are considering.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, what we propose doing is to allow Mr Strydom to consult with the three remaining applicants and then we will take the lunch adjournment now and allow him to consult with all of the applicants and then we will resume after lunch, do you have any objection to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No objection, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The time now is about twenty past twelve, should we come back at one thirty?  It would be one hour and ten minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can I ask until a quarter to two because I'm going to consult with three people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, very well.  Well if that is the case, what do you colleagues say to that request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We've got no problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, very well.  Well the Committee recognises the fact that we have probably been starting too early and perhaps finishing somewhat late and that may well have prevented you from consulting with your clients.  We will adjourn a this stage, take lunch and we will come back at quarter to two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when we come back, we expect at least you to have consulted with all the remaining witnesses and could you also make enquiries if you can, as to what is happening to Xholiseni Sibongeleni Mkhize or ask your instructing attorney to make enquiries from the other co-applicants as to when last he was seen or what his position is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  May I see all the legal representatives in the Committee shortly after this?  We will rise and come back at quarter to two.</p>

<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And do you confirm the contents of that affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> According to this affidavit, you arrived at the hostel on the date of the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I arrived on that day of the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Before you moved into Kwamadala hostel, can you just elaborate on what happened in the townships and what motivated you to move to Kwamadala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> What motivated me to move to Kwamadala hostel, I had a quarrel with two young men.  One of them was Doti and the other one was Skosana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>	Doti and Skosana were there at my place of work at Hollywood Inn Nightclub.  They wanted to hit Timothy Stals Mazibuko with a handgrenade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>	I said to them; stop doing what you intend doing.  If you want peace or harmony stop that because you are going to injure this person and all of us will be affected and the other people who know nothing about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>	They said they wanted to do their job.  I said - I drew my firearm, a 9mm that was in my possession and I told them that after finishing what they wanted to do, I was also going to hit them back.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>	The other said;  then that means the guy was my friend because I was prepared to do whatever on his behalf.  I told them that this person was a customer.  The situation was bad and I couldn't live freely in the township thereafter.  Whenever I'm walking around the township, I would see people looking at me in a funny way, in a strange way but I knew what the cause was ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Just to interrupt you there, this Doti and Skosana, were they members of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, they were well-known members of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During that period, were you a member of any political party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, can you take it from there, what then eventually happened and why did you move to Kwamadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> The month was April in 1992.  Skosana and other young men who were residing in that same area called me Umkgwenbe.  I told them to stop calling me with such a name.  Skosana referred to me - said I was a dog and he wanted to get something to hit me with.  When the other one opened his jacket I saw an AK47.  I ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>	They shot at me but they missed me and I went to my place.  I told my brothers and I told them that the situation was tense.  Just because I'd stopped the guys trying to hit Skosana(sic) with the handgrenade and Skosana influenced the other people against me and they told the other people that I was a member of Inkatha Freedom Party. </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>	My situation became worse.  On the 16th we couldn't sleep at our respective places because the people were pelting the house with stones.  We woke up.  I took that firearm, that 9mm.  I shot in the air for about five times.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>	The pelting of the stones subsided and my friend Jabulani said to me; it's better for us to leave the place because the people would come and burn us inside the house.  We did as Jabulani was saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>	I didn't even know that Jabulani was an IFP member.  We went to Jabulani's girlfriend and we spent a night there at her place.  Jabulani told them about the situation.  After that they said we must get into the shack.  They locked us inside the shack, they locked from the outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>	Jabulani opened the window and tried to talk to them through the window and asked them why were they using a padlock.  They said they that the people should think that there was no-one inside the shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>	On the 17th we woke up and Jabulani told us to go to a certain place to get better protection.  I asked him: "Where are we going?" and he said: "Lets go to Kwamadala hostel.  I had no alternative but we had to go to Kwamadala hostel.  We went to Kwamadala hostel, it was three of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who was the third person that went with  you and Jabulani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It was Doctor, the name was Doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now when you went to the Kwamadala hostel on that morning or during that day, did you know that there will be an attack on Boipatong that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Then what happened, how did you become aware that there was going to be an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> After we had got into this hostel in one of the rooms that was occupied by the young men from the township, we saw our old friend that used to work with us at Hollywood.  His name was Serame Mokoena.  We had some money, we bought some liquor.  We just wanted to calm down our emotions with this liquor.  As we were sitting there I went to the toilet to relieve myself.  I heard something like a whistle or siren.  I heard sound.  It looked like some people were talking outside, a number of people were talking outside.  I was in the toilet at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>	After relieving myself I went out of the toilet.  I enquired as to what was happening, what was this siren for.  Serame said it might happen that something is going to happen, maybe there are people who want to come to attack us because the siren wouldn't just ring for nothing.  He told us to go to the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>	We went to the stadium.  When we arrived at the stadium, as we were coming in Hollie Bajozi was going out of the stadium.  Serame asked him: "Why are you going out so quick, what was happening?".  Hollie Bajozi told Serame this: "We were instructed to go and fetch our weapons."  </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>	As he was telling us that, Mkhize came and he said: "I told you that this is the day that you've been waiting for, you must go and arm yourselves."  We left.  When I arrived at the house, Doctor gave me a pump-gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who gave you the pump-gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Doctor gave me the pump-gun.  After giving me this pump-gun there were two pump-guns left.  One was his and one was Jabulani's.   We left for the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>	When we arrived there, Damarra said each and every man must get out.  We went to Serele and we came back again - I beg your pardon, he said, if they can go to Serele and come back and find a man inside the hostel, that man would be killed.  We left for Serele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>	We used ntelezi just before going to that.  We applied that ntelezi on ourselves and we left through the gate.  We were in a hurry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you know at that stage what was going to happen in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, it was well-known that the Self Defence Units were to be attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you agree with the idea that Self Defence Units should be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, I did not agree.  As I was going there I did not agree with the idea.  As they said we were going to - if they said that we were going to Zone 12 at Sebokeng, I would be in the forefront but unfortunately we went to this nearest house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>	We went there, we went under the bridge, we walked behind the nursery ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Whilst you are in that area, did you see any Casspir vehicles there and did you get into a Casspir vehicle and were you transported to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So you said you were by foot, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> We went past the bridge that was on the tar road.  We walked through another footpath through the bridge and we took cover under a big tree.  We were told to wait there for the others.  They came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>	We were divided into two groups and we were told that another group should go in front and the other one would follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>	In that process we saw a fence from the school that was used to barricade, to close the road, and it was tied up next to a certain pole.  We removed that fence, we went through.  When we were at the corner, at the road that was used by the taxis, we were told to start with the job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you remember who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I was with Serame and I asked him who was the gentleman that was talking.  He said to me the gentleman was Damarra.  I said fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And what job are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> The job of attacking.  As we were going through on that road, we met with the Self Defence Units at the corner.  Damarra started shooting and the others followed those who had firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>	The Self Defence Units shot back.  Damarra took another direction with his group, going towards the direction of the shops.  I took another direction, taking that same street as we had used as we were coming in.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Plus-minus 300.</p>

<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I cannot remember whether he came after weeks or after a month, I just cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well when he arrived, was he only able to speak Sotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> He came to us and he was speaking in Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So how did you communicate with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I asked him about his visit, why was he there.  He first said to me the people want to burn him in the township because they said he was an IFP member.  I asked him what is it that he did that made the people to say that he was an IFP member ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Buthelezi, that's not really the question, the question is you say that Nosenga spoke Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, he spoke Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Now what you've been asked is how did you communicate with Mr Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>	Is that the question, M'am?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I understand the question.  He first greeted us, he said ...(Sotho).  That means he was greeting us in Sotho.  I noticed that he was a Sotho-speaking person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> But my question was, in what language did you communicate with him, how did you talk to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I can say I was born here in this Vaal Triangle.  I can speak both languages, Sotho and Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So were you conversing with him in Sotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> What was he relating to you, his reasons for joining the hostel?  You were telling us beforehand what he was telling you, can you just tell us again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> When I asked him why he was out of the township, he said the people were saying that he was an IFP member ...(end of tape) washing Hollie Bajosi's car.  I don't know what is it that he told the other gentlemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>	After a few days I heard Joseph Radebe who was also a witness during the trial, though he did not go to Pretoria, he told me that this person said he was sent by the ANC to try and inspect the place as to where can he plant the bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>	I got a shock because I realised that we were staying with someone who wanted to kill us.  I asked him;  gentleman, I asked you yesterday your reasons for being here in this hostel.  He said no, I was afraid, I was too scared.  Then Nosenga was then to be taken to the conference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Are you telling this Committee that he admitted to you that he was an ANC spy sent to plant bombs in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I was not alone, he admitted, I was with the other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did you discuss the attack with Mr Nosenga when he joined the hostel?  Did you relate details of the event of the attack to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Joseph Radebe would make an example about someone else in front of him.  I think this is where he got some idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> What motive would you then give to Mr Nosenga for alleging that he participated in the attack if he did not participate in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> The motive behind him saying that he was one of the people who participated in this Boipatong incident, perhaps he was regarding himself as a journalist, I don't know, or a newsman, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Now you've heard the version of Mr Nosenga that I've placed to all your fellow applicants to day, from the meetings that took place leading up to the attack and the attack itself.  I don't want to waste this Committee's time any further, so I'm just going to put to you that that is Nosenga's version, that there were policemen at the time assisting in the attack at Boipatong and that he did participate in the attack at Boipatong.  What are your comments and your comments regarding his statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well I put it to you, insofar as your version contradicts and differs Nosenga's that he is telling the truth and that you are not completely honest and open with this Committee, what are your comments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I'm the one who is telling the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I have no further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS TANZER</p>

<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>	Mr Buthelezi, after you became aware of Mr Nosenga's statement that he was an ANC spy and that he had been sent by the ANC to come and plant bombs in the hostel, what steps were taken to isolate Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> What do you mean, isolate him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, were any steps taken against Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> What steps were taken were that he was taken to Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How long after the allegation that he was an ANC spy was it until he was taken to Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I did get the question, I'm still thinking.  No, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, was it a week, two weeks, a month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, I cannot even begin to estimate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This was shocking news wasn't it, for you to discover that the man who is sleeping in your room is an ANC spy who has come to kill you, and you can't tell the Committee whether he continued to sleep in your room for a week or for a month after you became aware of that allegation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> He was always under our watchful eyes, even though he went to the toilet at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then how did you become aware of the fact that he was being taken to Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> A meeting was convened at Kwamadala to the effect that on a particular day people would be going to a conference at Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who addressed that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I cannot recall.  I was not quite familiar with the community at the hostel, only a few people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That was a meeting attended by all the residents of the hostel, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And at that meeting it was announced that Mr Nosenga is to be taken to the conference in Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was Mr Nosenga at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, he too was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So one can assume then that the entire hostel knew about Mr Nosenga and knew about his confession to be an ANC spy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And nobody attempted to harm Mr Nosenga in any way, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct, we received an instruction to the effect that we should not harm him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Oh, from whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> This came from Mr Thembankosi Khumalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was that also at a meeting held in the hostel immediately after it became known that Mr Nosenga was an ANC spy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Would you please repeat the question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This instruction from Mr Khumalo, was it issued at a general meeting in the hostel immediately after it became known that Mr Nosenga was an ANC spy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know who went to Ulundi with Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, there were people with whom I shared a room who went to Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Joseph Radebe, Serame Mokoena and Papie Skumbuzo.  In my room I think it was myself and a few others or should I say two boys who were twins.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you go to Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So Joseph Radebe, Serame Mokoena and papie Skumbuzo, they went to Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when they came back from Ulundi, did they tell you what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, they just informed me that Nosenga was put on stage, introduced and he was made to explain what drove him to Kwamadala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He was put on stage at the national conference and made to explain himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was this in front of the top leadership of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> That's how they told me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And did they tell you what Mr Nosenga said when he was on stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> They just informed me that Nosenga told the people there that he had been sent by the ANC to infiltrate the hostel and reconnoitre the area to establish where he could plant the bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>	I cannot remember which old man asked him but I think he was asked by an old man as to whether he was still prepared to go back to the ANC, and Nosenga is said to have said no, he's a member of Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then what decision - were you informed as to what decision had been taken at conference as to what to do with Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, I was not informed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well did Mr Nosenga come back to stay in your room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you speak to him about his trip to Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I asked him in the presence of other how they fared to and fro and he told me that they fared well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did Mr Nosenga tell you that he had met Chief Mangasotho Buthelezi at the conference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, he didn't explain that to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So as far as you were concerned it was alright for Mr Nosenga to come back and stay in your room, you were quite happy with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, because we had realised that he's a nice person.  He didn't have to be on his own thinking all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So from then on you treated him as a friend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I would say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Buthelezi, I want to put it to you that this version of Mr Nosenga admitting that he was an ANC spy who had come to blow up the hostel and kill the hostel residents is a fabrication and it has been concocted by you and some of your fellow applicants who have recently given evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, we have witnesses who arrived in Nosenga's presence.  There are people who can testify in my favour in this regard, people who are no longer at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who are those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Xhala, or should I say the first one would be Tsalmo, Nomjali Fasibiya ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know Tsalmo's surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know where he stays?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I used to see him at Zone 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When last did you see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Last week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is Zone 7 where, Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Tzwee is one person who has the full knowledge to this effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, you said that you last saw Tsalmo at Zone 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> At the shops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, but which township, in Boipatong, in Sebokeng or ..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> At Sebokeng, Zone 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said this was last week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is the other person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Tzwee Bajosi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> That's all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, I've got Salmo, Tzwee, Bajosi, who is the other one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Nomjali Fasibiya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And where does he stay, Nomjali Fasibiya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> When I asked him last week where he stays, he told me that he stays at the two rooms near Palm Springs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and Bajosi, where is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> At his parents' home, Zone 7, Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>	You say that Mr Bajosi would be able to come and tell the Committee everything about Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I trust that he can come here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Joseph Radebe, is he still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, he is arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where is he now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> The last time I heard he was in Groenpunt, Groenpunt in Stoffberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Serame Mokoena, where is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I have no idea as to whether he is still alive or not.  The last time I heard of him he had gone to Parys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Papie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> He too is incarcerated in Sun City.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And finally, Skumbuzo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> He cannot be found, he is moving about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This quarrel that you had with Doti and Skosana was in Sebokeng, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you friendly with Stals Mazibuko at Kwamadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see him at Kwamadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you take your 9mm with you to Kwamadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, we gave it to a boy called Lucky from Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you think you wouldn't need your gun once you got to Kwamadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, it never occurred to me that I might need it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So when you went to Kwamadala, you, Doctor and Jabulani, none of you had guns, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I would say as far as I'm concerned, Doctor and Jabulani had knowledge about the pump-guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, I'm not asking about their knowledge, I'm saying when the three of you entered Kwamadala on the 17th of June 1992, all three of you were unarmed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And where is Jabulani and Doctor today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> They died in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it correct that you - or let me ask you this, what time did you enter Kwamadala hostel on the 17th of June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It was round about 12 to 1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Wasn't it  about 3 o'clock in the afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> That is my estimation, 12 to 1 is my estimation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the criminal trial, page 3444 you said you arrived at the hostel at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I was not sure because - I am saying that I was not sure because I was angry about what happened to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So?  Because you were angry you said you arrived at the hostel at 3 o'clock in the afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> That was an estimation of time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> After you got into the hostel you were allocated a room you say, by Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then you went to your room together with Jabulani and Doctor, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What did you do between the time you got to your room and the time you heard the siren go off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> We held hands and spoke to some of the gentlemen that we found there.  We bought liquor, we sat drinking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And there was no talk that afternoon about an attack on Boipatong, was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In fact the first indication that you had that something was going on was when you heard the siren?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I asked what this whistle was all about, Serame then told me that we were wanted at the stadium, something might happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Doctor and Jabulani were drinking with you and talking throughout the afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> We sat drinking all together to the time that we heard the siren.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you see, my problem with that is there would then be no time for Doctor and Jabulani to go and fetch the shotguns from Sebokeng hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> There was time because at some point Jabulani disappeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, you see you said you sat drinking with them the whole afternoon until the siren went off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is what I've just said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you also say at some point in the afternoon Jabulani got up and left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he left the hostel and he went to Sebokeng hostel, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I only heard from him when he came back telling me that he was coming back from Sebokeng hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the distance from Kwamadala to Sebokeng hostel is quite far, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is quite a distance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he returned with two shotguns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> There were three of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I beg your pardon, three shotguns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> By himself he fetched three shotguns and brought them back to Kwamadala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Despite the fact that he too had no knowledge of any planned attack that night, that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you being honest when you say that you only came to the hostel on the 17th of June and that you had no knowledge whatsoever about a prior attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I am telling the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now when you got to the stadium you had no idea what it was all about, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What exactly were you told at the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> When we arrived at the entrance point, myself and Serame, that is the entrance point to the arena, we came across Bajosi and we asked him what was happening.  Hollie Bajozi then said to Serame;  Mkhize said this is the time, the time which you all have been waiting for, that we should go and attack.  He then said Mkhize had just said that we should go and fetch our weapons.  Indeed, we went to fetch our weapons.  As we were talking there, Mkhize spoke as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what - sorry ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Mkhize then said that the day of reckoning has arrived, it's about time we launched the attack.  We then went for our firearms or our weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did Mr Mkhize say anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I only heard him say what I've just said.  I don't know what he said before we arrived at the Arena.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did he say who you were going to attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Hollie Bajosi said we were going to attack the Self Defence Units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you know why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I already knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> From whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Serame had informed me that they were tired of being burnt all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you knew when you left Boipatong, when you left Kwamadala, that you were only going to attack the Self Defence Units?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The shotgun that you had was a pump-action, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The State witness, Mr Moloi, told the trial Court that you were in possession of a pump-action shotgun, so he was correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you were lying in the criminal Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Moloi also told the criminal Court that the following day he heard that, he heard you say that you had shot a small child in Boipatong, do remember that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, I don't.  I did not know the State witness at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But he knew you because he accurately described what you were carrying in Boipatong.  Let me read to you what was put to you at page 3447 of the record.  Mr Bajosi has said in Court that he saw there in Boipatong and that you shot at a person, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that evidence correct of Mr Bajosi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> That is a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never shot at a person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then it goes on.  Mr Moloi has testified that the following morning he was in a conversation with you and other people while he was drinking there and others were also drinking and then you said that you had shot a small child, do you remember that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say Mr Moloi was not telling the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Because you knew, or you know, and you knew then that small children were not part of the SDUs, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know what happened to your shotgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It was taken by Mr Damarra.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> He took it on the 17th, he took it together with the other two shotguns.  He brought them back on the following day, which was on the 18th and during which time we heard or we received information that we were going to be attacked by people from Serele.  When we came back, at the robots where we took a turn, Mr Damarra took these firearms again, put them in his Skyline and drove away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This is on the 18th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Damarra Chonco puts three shotguns into the boot of his car, were there other guns in the boot of his car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> His car was a distance from where we were.  It was on the side of a wall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But it was inside the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And there were other weapons in the boot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I did not get near the Skyline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then with your three shotguns in his car, he left the hostel and drove away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And at that time the hostel was surrounded by the police and the army?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> The police had not arrived yet and the soldier had not arrived as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What time of the day on the 18th was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It was in the morning.  It was after we heard that the Serele people were going to avenge.  The time could have been eight, nine or thereabouts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the people of Boipatong were marching towards the hostel, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> They had said they were going to avenge, that is insofar as rumour is concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And how were they turned away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> There were many soldiers and the Stability Unit around the area and they came to us,</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And it was only after that that Mr Damarra Chonco drove away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And at that time the army was already there outside the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> We left the soldiers and the police at the robots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you leave the hostel on the 18th to meet these people who were about to attack you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say, did you go as far as the robots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, we went as far as the robots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> After Damarra Chonco drove away with the three shotguns you never saw those shotguns again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I saw only two of them later and not mine.  He said he was going to bring my gun back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What happened to the two that he brought back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> The police confiscated them as exhibit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did he bring them back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> He brought them back after the soldiers and the police had left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This must have been many days after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It could have been a week or weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see Jabulani burying a shotgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> At the time when we were at the veld.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was it your shotgun that he was burying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> ...(no English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Whose shotgun was he burying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It was his own shotgun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This was after you had left Boipatong but before you returned to Kwamadala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It was on our way to Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On your way into Boipatong you saw Jabulani burying a shotgun in the ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Before the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Jabulani had already passed away at the time, I am the one who buried the shotguns.  I did not understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I think you understood the absurdity of your previous answer, but let's proceed.  You buried a shogun in the veld on your way to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> The guns were not hidden at Boipatong but were hidden at Kwamadala hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did you bury a shotgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, Mr Berger, he keeps talking about guns, not a gun, he's using the plural.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Mr Lax.  All of this flows from a question: "Did you see Jabulani burying a shotgun?", and he said: "Yes".  Now he says Jabulani didn't bury the shotguns, the shotgun, "I did".</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>	Do I understand you correctly, Mr Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I thought you were asking me if I did see Jabulani carrying a shotgun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'll start again.  Did you see Jabulani burying a shotgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the trial, your counsel put on your behalf a fact that you had seen Jabulani burying a shotgun.  And when I say on your behalf, I mean on your, Sipho Buthelezi's behalf it was put, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I do remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you say that is not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that was a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you tell your counsel that, that you saw Jabulani burying a shotgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I told him so.  I told him so as I was trying to run away from the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How many shots did you fire in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> About three times, I fired about three time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you fired into houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I fired only once, directing to the houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the other two times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I shot, directing my shots towards the SDUs and I shot for the second time in the air.  As the other people that were in my company were getting into the house I shot in the air.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did you shoot into the air?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I was too scared to kill a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You wanted to kill people, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that was the instruction that was coming from Mr Damarra.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you fired into the house because you wanted to kill whoever was in that house, you didn't care who was inside, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I shot at a certain window, the bullet penetrated the dining-room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that you didn't fire, you fired into the air because you were afraid of killing a human being?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Previously you had threatened to shoot at the people who wanted to throw a handgrenade at Stals Mazibuko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I knew that they wouldn't do that, they wouldn't hit Mazibuko with a handgrenade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you did threaten to shoot them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I tried to threaten them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You told us earlier on that if you had been instructed to go to Sebokeng, you would have been the first one to go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were you going to do there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I was going to kill the people who were trying to kill me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a>	Mr Buthelezi, at page 188 of your further particulars you say the following:  Question 6:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>"I had a shotgun and I fired shots in the direction of the houses and into the air."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At page 191, third last paragraph you say the following</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a>"I fired three shots in the first street which we entered.  I fired in the direction of the houses and into the air."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>Is that statement correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you fired at more than one house, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I shot at one house only.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You know that with a shotgun that the pellets spray all over the show, it's not just one bullet that comes out of a shotgun, you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So when you fire in the direction of one person you can hit 10 people, you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you went spraying shotgun pellets in the first street in which you entered Boipatong, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the first street that you entered in Boipatong, was at the bottom, the southern side of Boipatong.  The first street was Moshweshwe Street, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Though I do not know the name of the street, but it was the street next to the school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, that's Moshweshwe Street, right at the bottom of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And just at where you came in in that street, Moshweshwe Street, people were killed and in house 666 two people were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>DISTRESSED AUDIENCE MEMBER</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Mr Chair, may I be excused from the proceedings for a few minutes?  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the two people who were killed at 666, Mr Buthelezi, were Anna Sebolai and Percival Sebolai, and Percival Sebolai was shot in the face with a shotgun.  Is it correct, Mr Buthelezi, when you say that you didn't see who you were shooting at and you don't know if anyone was killed as a result of your shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I am sure that I did not see the person that I hit as I was shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just repeat your answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I am saying ...(indistinct) that as I was shooting, directing to the house on that particular street, I am not sure if I did hit someone or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you were shooting there were people around you with spears, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it correct that you went into the house at 666, you and your co-attackers, you shot Percival Sebolai whilst your co-attackers stabbed Anna Sebolai in Moshweshwe Street, the very first street that you entered?  Isn't that what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where was Jabulani and Doctor when you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> They disappeared, they just disappeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So they were not with you in Moshweshwe Street when you fired into the houses, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, they were not there with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you move down to Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, we took that direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And did you fire shots in Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I did not shoot thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I do not have a specific reason why I did not shoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> According to you, you hadn't killed anyone up to that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did you stop your shooting spree when you got to Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It's something that just happened unplanned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Weren't you still chasing the SUDs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> They had already run away, most of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Hadn't they run into the houses in Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> The others ran towards Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, and you followed them there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, we followed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you didn't shoot anymore, even though you could have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I did not use the chance to shoot them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You're not being completely honest with this Committee about your participation in the attack, are you, Mr Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You know because you saw the damage that a shotgun can cause, and you want to distance yourself from that horror, isn't that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Please repeat the question, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You know because you saw the damage that a shotgun can cause on a human being, and you want to distance yourself from that horror, that is why you say you didn't shoot anymore in Slovo Park and you don't know if you killed anybody in Boipatong.  I am right, aren't I?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I can still hear the interpreter interpreting whilst the next question was already asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The interpreter was still explaining the question to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I can respond like this, as follows:  at Boipatong I did not shoot anyone, all I know what I did was to shoot directing to one house only.  In my mind I think that was in the bedroom.  I was standing on the street, I think I hit the bedroom.  I shot in the air, I left the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well did you shoot once or did you shoot twice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I used three bullets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  The first shot that you fired, where was it directed at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> My first shot was directed at the Self Defence Units.  The second one was directed to one house and the bullet hit the bedroom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, you fired directing the shot at a bedroom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the third shot, was it the one that you fired into the air?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a>	You fired into a bedroom because you knew that there would be people in bed, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> In that bedroom the light was on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you knew there would be people in bed, that is why you fired into the bedroom, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I did not know that there would be people in bed, or there were people in bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did you fire into a bedroom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I was trying to break the windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well Mr Buthelezi, there were many people breaking windows.  Your job was to kill people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I've explained that I myself, I was afraid to kill a human being.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You knew when you fired into that bedroom, that you had a very good chance of hitting people in bed, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I was just shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Buthelezi, I can see you don't want to answer my question, I'll move on.  If there were police and police vehicles in Boipatong, you would have seen them, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If the police had assisted you and your fellow attackers in Boipatong, you would know about that, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I would know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Because you would have seen it and you would have discussed it with your co-attackers afterwards, am I right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Am I correct when I say you said Damarra's group went towards the shops and your group took the other route, that would mean that your group moved right down the first street in Boipatong, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In Moshweshwe Street I can just tell you that there were many windows smashed in many houses by your colleagues.  Do you agree that there were plenty of people around  you smashing windows in Moshweshwe Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At 11.93 Dick Mokoena was injured with a shotgun wound.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Dick Mokoena.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I do not know that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The next day after the attack, are you saying that you have no knowledge of anything being burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I did not know where these goods, the place, the spot where these goods were burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you do know that goods were burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Goods which were stolen from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who gave the order that those goods should be burnt, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> In the room that I was staying Damarra came in ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> He told us that if we had taken something from Boipatong, we should take it to the stadium so that it could be burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And was anything taken from your room to the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who had stolen stuff from Boipatong and what had they stolen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Hollie Bajosi brought a video machine, Skubuzo had a blanket, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Damarra said that these goods must be taken to the stadium to be burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, he said anyone who had stolen property from Boipatong, that should be taken to the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you went to the meeting at the stadium, had the goods already been burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I hope so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it that Themba Khosa gave the instruction that the goods should be burnt and the weapons should be destroyed?  I beg your pardon, the evidence linking you to the attack on Boipatong, should be destroyed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, that is not Mr Themba Khosa's instruction,  that was not Mr Themba Khosa's instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was his instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Mr Themba Khosa came and I heard him saying that they were shocked about the Boipatong incident and he wanted to know if we had any knowledge as to who did that, who was involved in that incident and  everyone denied having any knowledge to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No-one wanted to be arrested at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But when Themba Khosa spoke the police were not in the stadium, were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I think police were there on that particular day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you deny your involvement because you knew that such an attack would not be approved by Themba Khosa, is that why you denied it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, we denied our involvement there in that particular incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, the question is, did you deny your involvement in the attack because you knew that Themba Khosa would not have approved the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, Mr Khosa, I am sure that he wouldn't approve and he wouldn't be happy if he had known that we were the people who did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You knew that on the 18th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Will you please repeat the question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you know that on the 18th of June 1992, that Themba Khosa wouldn't have been happy if he had known that you were responsible for the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> That is my view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did Mr Mkhize give an instruction that the goods looted from Boipatong should be burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I don't know but in our room, Mr Damarra came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So would you answer at page 188 where you say: Question 5.1</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>"Mr Khosa did not give such a warning, this warning was given by Damarra and Mkhize."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>Would the reference to Mkhize there be wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I can say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you know Mr Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> No, at the time, did you know him, at the time of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, Serame pointed him to me at the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This is the night of the attack, the night of the 17th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Mr Buthelezi, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malindi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>	Mr Buthelezi, it's your evidence that you were not a member of the IFP before the 17th of June 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Are you talking about June or July?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> 17 June 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I was not an IFP member at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And the only conflict you had had with the ANC was the one involving Doti and Skosana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you become a member of the IFP subsequent to that, that is subsequent to the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I became a member on the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>	To the extent that you approved of this attack on Boipatong, it was because you were motivated by the desire to avenge what Doti and Skosana had done to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, deep in my heart I did not like the idea, I was not for the idea of attacking at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And you didn't want to take avenge in any form for what Doti and Skosana had done to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I would try and - I would revenge at Zone 12.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> So in other words, you can't put forward any reason why you attacked Boipatong yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> My reason to go to Boipatong is because Mr Damarra said openly that a man that be left behind or that would be left in the yard while the other men go to Boipatong, that man, the one who would be left in Boipatong - the man that would be left in the hostel whereas other men had gone fighting, that man it would be his very last day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> After you heard about Nosenga's existence, did you go up to him, Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I went up to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> When you got to him and questioned him, who else was with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It was a number of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Any names that you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It was the late Mtwala and Tzwee, Papie, Doti, Shemi and Matanana and Chanke.  Chanke is Joseph Radebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Was Mr Richard Dlamini anywhere near Nosenga at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, I did not see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Were Vusi and Spongolona also there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Though I cannot remember very well, as we were coming towards him I did not see the people who were in his company.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> At that time was Nosenga taken anywhere, after you questioned him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Do you mean on that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> On that particular day and specifically at the time when you were part of the group questioning him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> He came there and he joined us.  He stood there as we were washing the cars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> So as far as you are concerned, on this particular day, the day that you questioned him, he was not taken to any person, he just lay around the premises of Kwamadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> As we were there with him, in the evening a meeting was held.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> The meeting was held in order to address the Nosenga issue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Will the speaker please repeat the previous question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Was this meeting held to discuss the Nosenga issue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, and the other subjects were to be discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Up until this meeting was called, you had seen Nosenga walking about the premises, he was not handed over to anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I can see Nosenga was shocked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And at this meeting, was this meeting on the same day on which you first met Nosenga and you were part of this interrogating group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> I don't remember if I've asked this question, where was this meeting held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> The meetings was held at Kwamadala hostel at the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And who dealt with the Nosenga issue at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Mr Thembankosi Khumalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And Nosenga was at the stadium also?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, he was also present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And where had he come from before he presented himself at the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I do not understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did Nosenga go to the stadium like anyone else when the meeting was called?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Nosenga went to the IFP Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did he present himself to the committee or how did he get to go to the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> He came to the stadium with the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the question - wasn't your question how did,  did he go on his own to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Yes, that was my question, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> People came to fetch him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Who fetched him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I cannot remember those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> You yourself did not see Nosenga being taken away and being taken to the IFP Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, no further questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a>	As at the 17th of June 1992, how many of you were occupants in the room that you were occupying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It is very difficult for me to say but it was a lot of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're not being asked about the hostel as a whole, you're being asked about the room that you occupied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Do you want to know how many people occupied one room, is that your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Occupied the room which you also occupied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> If I'm not mistaken I think we were about 10 or 13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And I take it that in the light of Damarra assertion that every man must go and attack Boipatong, all your roommates did participate in the attack, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And of all your roommates, it's only three of you, that is yourself and the two twins who did not attend the Ulundi conference subsequent to the attack, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And your roommates who attended the Ulundi conference, were they necessarily delegates for that conference or were they just attending the conference as interested persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I think they went there as interested people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Why did you not attend the conference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I was not interested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR STRYDOM:</span> This interrogation which was referred to which you had with Mr Nosenga, was that an informal situation or was it a formal situation, like a committee situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> We would ask questions randomly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now when Mr Nosenga said that he was planted in the hostel as a spy and that he should look for places where he could plant bombs and all that, did you believe him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, we believed him because there were threats all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When you arrived at the hostel with Doctor and Jabulani, did you arrive by car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, we used public transport, we used taxis and we alighted at the robots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You stated that the instruction to attack was given by Damarra, now if no order was given by him to attack Boipatong, would you have attacked Boipatong out of your own freewill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, we would not attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you realise at that stage that Damarra was one of the leaders at the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You testified about three shots which you fired in the beginning stages of the attack and later on you went to Slovo Park, did you see any comrades in Slovo Park, or did you find any comrades in Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> The comrades at the street that intersects the Slovo Park and Boipatong, they jumped to the side of the shacks and they disappeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After they disappeared, did you see them again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, we did not see them again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know or did you see where Doctor and Jabulani fired shots with their shotguns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, I did not see them shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Apart from yourself, Doctor and Jabulani, do you know if other people also had shotguns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> The person that I remember seeing was Mr Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Apart from him - let me ask you, did you know exactly what weapon each of the attackers had with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom, what is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If he knew the weapons of each one of the attackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There were approximately 300 attackers the evidence indicates, so do you want him to tell us what each one of these men had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I know that the answer is obviously no, but if that is the situation he won't know if other people also had shotguns.  That is basically the point I want to make.  I can just put it straight away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a>	Do you know if some of the other attackers had shotguns with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, it was quite a large number of people.  The only person that was in front of me was Mr Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I've got no further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STRYDOM</p>

<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS TANZER:</span> Just two or three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>	Who related to you the event that Nosenga was on the stage at Ulundi?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Will the speaker please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Who related to you the event that Nosenga was on the stage at Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It was Joseph Radebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did Nosenga tell you about this when he returned from Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, Mr Nosenga did not mention that to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did you not ask him questions about being on the stage in Ulundi?  I mean it's quite an honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, I did not ask him question, the people were just discussing.  I did not ask him a question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did he ever tell you that at the hostel you people were thanked for the good work done in Boipatong, by Chief Mangasotho Buthelezi himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Now on your version Nosenga joined the hostel after the attack, that is correct right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Would you say that he got his information relating to the attack from his fellow roommates and hostel dwellers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I think he got that information from the other hostel dwellers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Do you think that in fact he pieced together the attack on Boipatong from information he obtained, resulting in the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Then is it not correct that even if your version is correct and true,  you are not relating an important fact to this Committee and that is that the police were involved in the attack of Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> The police were not present and the soldiers were not present during the attack at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Were you part of Victor Keswa's hit-squad or gang?</p>

<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks, Chair, just two quick questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a>	You said that a number of you went out to the robots early in the morning on the 18th when you suspected some sort of an attack, did I hear it correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> How many of you went out there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It was quite a large number of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> More than 50, more than 100?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I think it was more than 100.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And how did you get marshalled out, who brought you together so that you knew about these things that you went out there?  In other words, who called you together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It was Mr Damarra.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And that's when you were re-issued with your shotgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The second issue was the question of Nosenga, you were questioning him and you said they came and fetched him to the Committee, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I do remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Where did they fetch him from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> He was fetched from the room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So after you chaps had finished talking to him  you went back to the room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Will you please repeat your question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you go back to the room after you had finished talking to him or asking him questions etc?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, we went back to the room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Advocate Sigodi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You say that you went to the hostel for the first time on the 17th of June.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Had you been to the hostel before that date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you have friends staying at the hostel, did you know anyone before going to the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Who did you know before going to stay there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> There's a gentleman called Tabang that I used to know and one gentleman called Bono, the other one was Faltein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Alright, but were you a frequent visitor to the hostel before staying there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I was not a frequent visitor there at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And before the attack were you active in politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And this difference between you and Doti and Skosana, why do you think that it was a political difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I knew very well that Skosana and Doti were well-known people at Zone 12, each and everyone at Zone 12 knew them at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> No, but why do you ascribe your difference with them to being a political difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It is solely because they said Stals was a member of IFP, that was Smith.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But when you went to join the hostel you were not an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I was not yet a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You joined on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you submit your name to somebody, saying that you were joining the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, though I cannot remember the name of the person but I was issued a card.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Why did you join the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It's because the people were accusing me of being an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Yes, but was it necessary to join as an IFP member on that day?  Let me put it this way, you were only seeking  refuge in the hostel, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> It wasn't necessary for you to join as an IFP member on that particular day, is it correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, there was no need for me to join the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Why did you choose that day to join and become an IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> In the township already they were accusing me of being an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you agree with the IFP policies?  Did you know the IFP police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you know who were the leaders of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I knew the leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Who was the leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It was Doctor Mangasotho Buthelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Alright.  And you say that when you joined the group to go and attack in Boipatong, you were not really keen or deep down in you you were not for the attack on the SDUs, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Will you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You say that you did not align yourself with the idea of attacking the Self Defence Units in Boipatong on that night?  You didn't know anything about the attack before then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I knew nothing about the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And so you only went there to attack simply because you were scared of threats by Damarra Chonco that you would be killed if you did not join the attack, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a>	When Nosenga told you a different story than the one that he was sent by the ANC to plant the bombs, did these events happen when you were washing the car, on the same day or was it on different days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> As I was questioning him as to what was the reason for him to come to Kwamadala hostel, we were still washing the cars and he told me that the people who were accusing him of being an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a>	When I heard from Chunkie the following day he said the reason for that person to come to Kwamadala hostel was to assist the possibility of planting bombs.  I went back to him and I said;  Sir, I asked you the reasons yesterday and you told me that the people who were accusing you of being, you told me that you were being accused of being an IFP member whereas you know very well that you were there to check whether you can plants the bombs.  And he told me that he was afraid to tell me the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So when you confronted him of having told you a lie, was it also at the spot where you were washing cars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> We were in the house, in the room when I was asking him that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Earlier in your evidence when you were asked about the shot you directed at a house, I heard you saying that you directing it at the dining-room, but under cross-examination you say you directed it at the bedroom.  Did I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, you did not hear me well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You said Nosenga was left to live in the hostel because he was asked by an elderly person at Ulundi and he said that he was an IFP person, he was no longer ANC, did Nosenga become a member of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, he became an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> At what stage, when did he become a member of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> After the conference in Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, no further questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anything arising?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, there's just one question and it's for clarification only.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a>	Mr Buthelezi, the Mkhize that you saw armed with a shotgun, that's Bhekinkosi Mkhize, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I saw him with an AK47 rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, the question was, which Mkhize did you see with a shogun?  We're trying to clarify which Mkhize you saw with a shotgun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No-one was armed with a shotgun, it was</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>only a rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So that was Bhekinkosi Mkhize that had an AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It is Archie's one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> "It's my co-applicant, yes."</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> It is my co-accused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm sorry, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a>	In answer to a question by your counsel under re-examination as to who else had shotguns, you mentioned a person by the name of Mkhize, and I want to know that Mkhize, is it Bhekinkosi Mkhize, your co-accused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I thought you were referring to a rifle.  I just said he had a firearm, I did not know that he was referring specifically to the size of the firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
