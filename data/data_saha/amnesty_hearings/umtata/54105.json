I did it this morning, but for those of you who were not here, I'll do it again for your benefit.  On my left is Mr J B Sibanyoni, he's a Member of the Amnesty Committee and he is an attorney and he comes from Pretoria.  On my right is Mr Ilan Lax, also a Member of the Amnesty Committee, also an attorney and he comes from Pietermaritzburg.  I am Selwyn Miller, I'm a Judge of the High Court, and I come from Umtata and I'm attached to the Transkei Division of the Court.  I'm also a Member of the Amnesty Committee.\n\tAs you can hear, these proceedings will be simultaneously translated into isiXhosa.  Before we proceed, I'd request the legal representatives to kindly place themselves on record.  Mr Dukada?",
