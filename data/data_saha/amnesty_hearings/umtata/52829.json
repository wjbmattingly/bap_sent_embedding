I am saying this because we couldn't  work in any of the neighbouring States at all, such as Transkei, Venda or Bophuthatswana, unless arrangements had indeed been made with the relevant Security Branch in that TBVC State.\n\tArrangements were usually made, let's say for example in Bophuthatswana the arrangements would have been made through the Liaison Officer who was stationed at Zeerust.  For example if we wanted to do an operation in Venda, we would liaise with the Liaison Officer who was liaising with Venda, who would then be stationed at Louis Trichardt.\n\tIn other words, we would have liaised with one of two institutions in order to do work in the Transkei.  One would have been Aliwal North, with Willie de Lange, a Captain Willie de Lange, the other would have been with Warrant Officer Dan Naude, who was officially and generally known as the Liaison Officer or person who liaised with the Transkei Security Forces, and then indeed with the Head Office.\n\tOnly then would C1 be able to enter the Transkei and in co-operation with a Transkei Security member or police member, would they be able to take action within the Transkei, because they didn't have any powers of arrest.\n\tMy recollection is also that this infiltration of the ANC and PAC members was undertaken from the Lesotho area to Transkei.",

Lieutenant Adamson, a former Koevoet member and unfortunately he is deceased today, he had cancer, he was in control of this group as far as I can remember.\n\tShosha was a female member of the ANC who had only just begun working for us.  Lieutenant Adamson mentioned to me and I remember that this was during a telephonic conversation, that there was a wrestling which took place in the kombi between the Security Force members and the ANC member.\n\tThe ANC member escaped through one of the side windows of the minibus and during this, it happened that they held him by his shoes and during his escape, he lost his shoes.  That is actually how he escaped, but during the struggle Shosha shot this man through the leg with a pistol.\n\tAnd apparently, according to my understanding, this shot was placed high up on the hip.  She had a 32 pistol.  She had been issued a 32 pistol as all female  members of the police were issued.\n\tI must just say that this is possible, but I did not want to include this in order to border on speculation, however, I do believe that it is significant.  The information which was based largely on hearsay was that the Transkei Police were handling the case and that an informal inquest was held into the matter.\n\tA while after that, questions were however posed in Parliament as to who this former ANC member had been, who was in the service of the Security Police and had been appointed as a member of the South African Police.\n\tI was called in by Brigadier Willem Schoon and requested to cover up the identity of the former ANC member.  It was then denied that such a member ever existed or that any former ANC member had ever been in the service of the SAP.\n\tI cannot recall the entire process in particular, but I did make arrangements for the removal of the documentation from Tshabalala's file as well as for the removal of any other relevant information on the central computer network of the South African Police.\n\tThe nett result thereof was that Tshabalala ceased to exist for all ends, that would be administrative and any other purpose.\n\tI continued to appoint Tshabalala and once again took him into service at Head Office as a source and appointed him under the name of Mavusu.",
