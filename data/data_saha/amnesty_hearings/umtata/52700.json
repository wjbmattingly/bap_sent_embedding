And in the second document which sets out a list of statements which were submitted at the magistrate, one of the statements is that of Mr Shabalala and the first thing I ask from Mr Mapoma whether the statement is available.

And we pursued this with Inspector Jordaan. He said they don't have this inquest record nor the inquest findings. What he has with him there are the extracts of the statements that were made to the inquest proceedings. And those documents all that he had are the documents that he handed over to us. We do have some documents with us which we received from him. But we cannot say that there are some documents which he has that we do not have.
