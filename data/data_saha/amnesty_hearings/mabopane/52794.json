Firstly, after I was detained in 1978 I was expelled at Rondylane and I came to Pelotona in Mabopane.  \n\tThe following year 1980 I went to Megakasi High School where I led a student revolt and Tata Molope being the type of a commander who would be at the forefront of his men, was actually commanding the battalion or the group of policemen who attacked us at Megakasi High School.\n\tAs a leader I approached him and tried to plead with him.  He had a baton which baton he forced into my mouth and such things happened on a number of occasions when I was detained.\n\tLike I say, he was a type of commander who would be at the forefront of his men.
