He was nearly beaten in that only the membership, not APLA itself that time, I was in Dar Es Salaam at that time, just to tell the membership internally that no, the situation - Africa thinks we must participate in the negotiations and we must participate in the negotiations in Cape Town, I think it was well read in the newspapers then, those who were in South Africa at the time.  He was booed in that meeting, he could not finish what he was saying and at that time he was the most respected person because he was the Chairperson of the PAC and also the Commander in Chief of APLA at the time but his credibility was lost because of the militancy within the PAC at that time and this was a very short space of time for anybody really.  I agree with the sentiments of also of the gentleman here when they continued because also ourselves at that time, we could not take a very serious decision.  We had senior internal members of the High Command who could not see things, also the other people do see things.  We had to iron out those differences and they continued, despite the fact that that was done, but they continued and they are still continuing.  When we are meeting we are still labelling each other, sell-outs and the rest, amongst our own selves, so this is the depth of the problem.",

So it's my submission that, Chairperson, the statements which were made with the intention of going to Court, definitely I know that though it's taken into regard in some other aspect, but it's not the thing that the Commission will decide on the amnesty because most of the people lie in Court, they lie deliberately in Court because the first thing that comes to mind is the way of getting out of this whole thing.  \"If I put it this way I may get out with the whole thing.\"  So definitely Chairperson, if one admits that:  \"What I did, I did this and I did with the purpose of political objective\", you are sunk, there's no doubt about that.\n\tNow, therefore Chairperson, it's my submission that the applicants have met all the requirements of the Act and that they belonged to a bona fide political organisation and what they did, they did in pursuance of the struggle of the PAC at the time.

I would say:  \"Look, they did that in defiance, so what they did, they did for their own benefit, it had nothing to do with the struggle at the time\", but as Col Poni correctly put it and of course he put it in a very diplomatic manner, but I must say that Letlapa Mphahlele was a Director of Operations and everybody was looking at him and as he said that they have to do damage control, the first thing they have to get hold of the Director of Operations who was in the Transkei in the rural areas.

Now the High Command outside has to contact him to say:  \"Look, a decision has been taken, the arms struggle has to be suspended, he has to stop everything now\" but they could - of course Moses has to contact him but at that time Letlapa had not been ordered by Sabelo Pama to stop everything and by the time everything was ordered, where was Letlapa?  He was in Lesotho.  He has run away because everybody was after him.  He was hiding in Lesotho because also himself, he could not face the forces because everybody did not understand.   Chairperson I know that's not the platform for that because it has a lot to involve in it and of course at the end of the day who is suffering?  The ordinary foot soldiers.",

The victims and the ordinary foot soldiers because of the politicians and the politicians now are nowhere to be - they are alone in jail and the victims are here, they are nowhere who are responsible for the whole thing.  Must they, Chairperson, be punished because of the decisions of the politicians?  Must they suffer because of the decision of the politicians because they take hasty decisions, they could not face them to tell them and explain to them that look, this is the decision and they decided that they'll hear it over the radio or on the papers and they knew that APLA has to follow certain procedures before it has come to ...  Chairperson I know that I've been involved in many hearings with the Chairperson and one of the incidents happened in March, if Chairperson would remember, it was a repossession here, it was an APLA - and they came from Lesotho.  At that time the arms struggle was suspended and Letlapa was there and it was under his command and Tabelo Maseko was there, who's the head of repossession and he testified in that hearing that:  \"I ordered them because at that time there was nothing as APLA - we have not taken that decision to suspend the arms struggle and those people were granted amnesty, if I still remember ...(indistinct) the other applicant they could not get him because he was at Lesotho, he did not receive the notice so it's still going to be heard.\n\tSo Chairperson it's my submission that the applicants should not - the responsibility of the politicians should not be put on their shoulders and therefore Chairperson they should be granted amnesty as they applied for as they have met all the requirements of the Act.  \n\tChairperson, unless there is any aspect you want me to address you on.",

Applicant number one conceded under cross-examination that it was their intention to rob the bank at Mankweng, Standard Bank, it was their intention to rob the bank at Lebowakgomo, it also was their intention to go back to two shops to rob those shops.  Applicant number two under cross-examination and despite his statement said no, it was never their intention to rob the two Standard Banks and the two respective shops.  That's number one.  Number two, as far as applicant number two is concerned Mr Chair, he now avers that his statement to the police, which was never used in Court, is false.  His evidence before the Court was false and even his instructions to his counsel were false.

The second problem, or my second submission I would like to make Mr Chair, it was asked to the applicant\n\"Why did you rob, or why did you attack the shop or cafe or restaurant in Roedtan?\"\nand the answer was:  \n\"To get petrol money\"\nnot to achieve a political gain.  To get petrol money.  Why did they want petrol money?  To go back to Alexandra, not to go and attend the political meeting or anything like that.  They conceded under cross examination that the reason why they've robbed the Bouwer family or the restaurant and killed the two Bouwer husband and wife and wounded the young Mr Bouwer was to get petrol money, it wasn't for any political gain.  It was solely and they conceded that under cross-examination, to get petrol money.  Why did they want petrol money?  To go back to Alexandra.  Therefore Mr Chair it is my submission that from the statement and from the cross-examination, it's my submission that the applicants were busy with criminal activity and not with, as far as the Bouwer family are concerned, I'm not appearing on behalf of the Pyper family Mr Chair, was there was no political aim or political gain to be obtained by killing the Bouwer family.  The reason was to get petrol money to go back to Alexandra.  Thank you Mr Chair.",

            "Chairperson firstly on the question that the applicants, the other applicant indicated that the intention was to rob and the other one said it was not the intention to rob this place, Chairperson it's my submission that both applicants agree that they went to this with the purpose of\nreconnoitring the place for purposes of attack, so they are not denying that.  It was reconnoitred for purposes of that, so it's not in dispute that the purpose was, at the end of the day, for going there to rob, though they did not do it that time because the others were saying it was for reconnaissance first, which is understandable Chairperson.  \n\tNow coming to this point, the other point is that, Chairperson, it must be borne in mind by the Committee that there was a Commander.  They were always acting on the instruction of the Commander, Morapapa, who they were depending on.  They did not take the decision on their own and coming to this point, the decision was that they need petrol and it's agreeable, the petrol for what?  They were busy reconnoitring the places and for whose benefit were they reconnoitring these places when they ran out of petrol?  Was the purpose of pursuing the struggle.  And then they ran out of petrol and the petrol, they were going to use it, was in furtherance of that and according to them, but at the end of the day, who was commanding?  The Commander decided at that time, as the first applicant indicated, he never said anything and he attacked.  \n\tNow Chairperson, should they be now at the end of the day - unfortunately he cannot come and answer for what as to when did he decide to change his mind.  We don't know whether, Chairperson, at the end of the day he was going to take the money and also kill the people, but what they were told was that they wanted - they have to have the money for petrol because they cannot continue with their activities without the money for petrol.  So definitely Chairperson, if one reads that in all in perspective as to what the activity was, but if you take incident by incident as to what was happening, definitely Chairperson we will punch all the holes, definitely, you won't get the gist of the whole thing as to what was the purpose and we'll remain with many questions, but unfortunately the person who's supposed to answer the question, is the person who was tasked with the duties to establish APLA.",

Thank you and also Mr Bouwer, we appreciate the fact that you have come here today and you obviously have our deepest sympathies about this tragic incident, the loss of your parents and also your own personal loss and I'm sure it must have taken a lot of courage to come here and that is appreciated.
