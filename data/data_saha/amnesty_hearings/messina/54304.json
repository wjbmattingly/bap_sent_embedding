I was carrying a rifle and Moses Motapo and Lebohang had a hand grenade in his possession.  Only Ashley was not armed because he was driving.

We put him in the boot.  I cannot recall whether we put him in the boot of the vehicle in which he was travelling or our boot.  We drove him to some place called Boyne near Moria.  There was some bush there and we took him out and took him to the bush.  It was myself and Moses who removed him from the boot.  The other one and Lebohang, Ashley and Lebohang remained behind in the vehicle and we told Ashley and Lebohang to signal to us because we wanted to shoot the person and they would have to signal if there was no car approaching so that we could shoot the person.

Upon arrival at the taxi rank, Ashley and others were waiting for us in a BMW and we went to Motapo's place, that's where we were based and nothing happened that week until Friday.  On that Friday Moses said we should go around and reconnoitre the area to try and get another target and we went, it was on Friday night.  I didn't know the Northern Province.  I didn't know the places that we were going to.  We went to some place around 10 at night at Rotwane and Moses saw a shop and he told Ashley to stop the vehicle, which he did and then he sent Ashley to go to the shop to buy and check the situation in the meantime so that we can go in.  Ashley went in, bought some cigarettes and he came back and informed Moses that the situation was conducive for us to go in and we stopped around the shop and myself and Moses went out and we left Ashley and Lebohang behind and I was following Moses from behind.  We had rifles in our possession and when we entered the door of the shop, Moses opened fire.  He shot the father and the mother and there was a young boy, who could have been around 14 years old and when Moses shot the father and the mother, this young boy managed to get hold of Moses and I too was inside and they were wrestling over the firearm and Moses said:  \"You see what this boy's doing, shoot him\" and I shot him.  Even though Moses had not instructed me so, I would have shot the young boy.  I shot him and I thought he had died because I shot him at close range, only later I discovered that he didn't die.\n\tWe went out.  We went back into the car and drove away, but the vehicle did not drive a long distance and it broke down.  We left the vehicle there and took our bag with firearms and ran away until the following day which was on a Saturday.  On Saturday morning we wanted to get a vehicle, or hike away and the first vehicle that we came across was a police vehicle and the police apparently had surrounded the whole area.  They arrested us and we were made to lie down, the three of us and Ashley was not there because we had planned that because the vehicle is not a stolen vehicle, he should run into the bush and later he would claim that he was robbed of his vehicle, so that he was not there when we were arrested. \n\tWe were made to lie down and Moses tried to run away as we were lying down, because we had our bags hidden just nearby so that these people should not see that we had firearms and when Moses rose, trying to get to the bags, one white man shot him and he died and that's how we were arrested.",
