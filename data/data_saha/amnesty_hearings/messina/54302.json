Then I took out that AK47 and I fired shots to both people who were transporting me and I escaped.\n\tA couple of days later, because I could not get some water and I was hungry, I think it was nine days later when I came across a young girl.  I asked some water from that person, the she said:  \"Okay, wait here\", then she went inside the farm.  Then she didn't come with water.

            "Yes, well I sincerely hope it would be somewhat earlier than today, seeing we only started after lunch.  It would seem in any even that we won't be finishing this matter tomorrow because there's have to be argument as well and Mr de Beer might - but would it be possible to start at 9 o'clock in the morning because we'd like to finish.  We have another matter on the roll which we would like to get on straight away after that and hopefully, if we don't finish it, make large inroads into that.  \tYes, I think then if we could start at half past eight then, if -  that would be good.  I'd then just like to say that we'll adjourn now to continue with the hearing at half past eight in the morning and when we will be commencing with the evidence of the witness to be called by Mr Wagener and I'd just like to apologise to the people who stayed later than they expected, but we started late, we just wanted to get as far as possible in this matter.  Thank you.\n\tWe'll now adjourn until half past eight tomorrow.\nCOMMITTEE ADJOURNS",
