            "I will do that, Mr Chairperson.  The affidavit reads thus\n\"I, the undersigned, Mangalisekile Bhani, do hereby make an oath and say that I am the applicant in the Randfontein ...(indistinct) operation.  The facts to which I depose are true and correct and within my personal knowledge unless the context states otherwise.\n\tI was born in Uitenhage in Rocklands Plot on the 1st January 1970.  I grew up in the Eastern Cape.  We were eight children at home and I was the last born.  We were supported by a person who was living on an old age pension. \n\tI left school doing standard seven in 1986, due to financial reasons.  My mother died in 1985 and my father in 1987.\n\tI joined the PAC through Azania in 1986 when I was 16 years, and joined APLA in April the same year in exile.  I received my military training in Tanzania and Guinea.  I became a platoon commander and instructor.  I came back into the country in 1992 and I went to Transkei.\n\tI was arrested in September 1994 when I was already a member of the South African National Defence Force.  I am currently serving 58 years for the Wesselsbron operation, having been sentenced by the Bloemfontein High Court on the 25th of October 1995 under case number 23/94.\n\tI was part of the APLA unit that attacked a fruit and vegetable shop in Randfontein.  We received instructions for this operation from comrade Ntjebe.  We were a unit of three and I was the commander of the unit.  It was myself, Nkopane and Tando.  Myself and Nkopane were armed with R4 and Tando with handgrenade.  \n\tWe went to this target by car which belonged to one of the Africans named, Hlakene and I do not remember his name as I was not well versed with the area as I was not from there. When we arrived the owner was on the telephone and I demanded money from him.  He said he has no money.  When I was trying to look for money on my own he tried to grab my firearm and I shot him.  The time I think was around 19 hours and 20 hours.  We found an amount of     R3 000,00.  \n\tOne would raise a question that at the time of this incident all the political parties were preparing for elections and that the PAC which was leading APLA was alleged to have suspended the armed struggle.  \n\tI want to state that I raised this point with comrade Ntjebe when he was giving the order and was a member of High Command.  He told me that PAC has not yet informed them that the armed struggle is suspended.  He told me that the PAC Congress resolved in December 1993, that the time when it is ripe, it is opportune for the suspension of the armed struggle.  The President, members of the High Command and commanders will discuss this matter and decide about the date of the suspension of the armed struggle, and none of this has been done.  Neither the PAC nor the Director of Operations has told him about the suspension of the armed struggle.\n\tHe further told us that maybe the reason the PAC has not ordered APLA to suspend the armed struggle has been sceptical of negotiation process and anticipated what was being done by AWB at the time. He further advised us that the PAC President has told them many times that the PAC will not abandon the bullet until the ballot is secured and the ballot was not yet secured.  It was therefore my duty as a disciplined cadre of the PAC to carry out the order given to me by my superior.  We were arrested for this incident but we were released because of lack of evidence. \n\tI respectfully submit that my application complies with the requirements of the Act and that I have made full and proper disclosure of my involvement in the Randfontein ...(indistinct) Shop operation. I therefore humbly request that my application for amnesty be granted.\n\tSigned by the applicant.\nThank you, Mr Chairman.",

            "Thank you, Mr Chairperson.  The affidavit reads as follows\n\"I, the undersigned, Tapelo Patrick Maseko, do hereby make an oath and say that the facts to which I depose are true and correct and within my personal knowledge, unless the context states otherwise.\n\tI was born on the 3rd day of May 1956 in Westonaria.  I started school at Nibanong Gold Mine and went to Mapute Community School in Bekkersdal until standard six.\n\tI then worked at Kloof Gold Mine until I left the country in 1986.  I joined the PAC through Azanyo in 1983.  \n\tOn the 18th day of June 1986 I left the country to Botswana where I stayed until December 1986.  I left Botswana for Tanzania where I stayed for a week before moving to Guinea Canary for military training.  I did infantry training for three months and returned to Morogoro Camp at Iringa, Tanzania.  I stayed there for more than three years undergoing intensive political and ideological remoulding.  \n\tI was thereafter deployed inside the country at the end of December 1989.\n\tWhen I returned to the country through Harare, we were a unit of four called \"Makana Detachment\", comprising of myself, Lumumba, Telo and Small Baby.  We met our contacts, Junior and Siki in Bulawayo, who arranged for us to enter the country.\n\tThe two contacts arranged for us to meet a person at Mmbatho Sun.  It was arranged that we should enter the country in pairs.  Myself and Telo went first.  We met our contact at the pre-arranged place and time.  He took us to a taxi rank and we boarded a taxi to Johannesburg.\n\tIn Johannesburg we met our contact, Mr Tepani Moswade. He took us to a safe place in Orlando West, Pefini, where we stayed until the other two comrades we left at Bulawayo arrived with arms. \n\tI was deployed inside the country with specific instructions to advance the struggle for the liberation of the African people in all fronts.  We were told that the PAC and APLA have no funds and therefore the cadres should be self reliant.  We were told that the targets will be chosen by us.\n\tThis unit therefore was called \"Repossession Unit\".  The was the first unit to be sent in the country for this specific purpose, although we were to conduct other operations.\n\tI was involved in 28 other operations.  I'm still waiting for the outcome of the application in respect of 11 others.\n\tThe affidavit of comrade Bhani has been read to me. I confirm it insofar as it relates to me.  I confirm that I gave an order for the operation at Randfontein vegetable shop.  I further confirm that at the time of the operation I was a member of APLA High Command and head of APLA Repossession Unit, codenamed \"Beauty Salon\".  \n\tThe unit was duly established by APLA High Command, with the full knowledge and unequivocal approval of the PAC political leadership.  The task of the unit was to repossess from the enemy items such as weapons, money, jewellery and vehicles and other necessities which were necessary for the APLA operations.\n\tI was reporting directly to the Director of Operations, who was reporting directly to the Defence Secretary.  \n\tAt no stage did I use my position to enrich myself or my poverty stricken family.  I am aware that at the time of this operation it was being rumoured that PAC/APLA has suspended the armed struggle.  I want to make it clear that the members of APLA who represented APLA members at the PAC conference in Umtata, reported that the PAC leadership has been given a mandate to suspend the armed struggle when the time is opportune.  And before doing that they will discuss this matter with the APLA High Command and commanders on the ground and thereafter announce the suspension of armed struggle.  This never happened until at the time of this operation.\n\tWe as commander of APLA thought that PAC political leadership decided to take a tactical position to announce the suspension of the armed struggle in the manner they did, as the did, in the manners they did not comply with the resolution of the PAC comrades.\n\tWe thought that they were aware that the right-wingers were arming themselves with the purpose of disrupting the election, hence they did not bide by the decision of the congress.  The PAC President then, is on record saying that the PAC will never abandon the bullet until the ballot is secured.  \n\tIt is in that spirit that I ordered the operation because the ballot was not yet secured and PAC has not yet suspended the armed struggle according to the congress resolutions.\n\tAt no stage did the comrades use their position to enrich themselves or their poverty stricken families.  I hope this will go a long way in decriminalising the bravest, selfless and dedicated heroes of our anti-colonial struggle.\n\tThe money was handed to myself after the operation and I also handed it over to the Director of Operations.  I therefore humbly request that their application for amnesty be granted as they did not act for personal gain, nor out of malice, ill will or spite against the victims, they acted on my orders.\n\tSigned by the applicant.\"\nThank you, Mr Chairperson.",
