<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Chisoma, what language would you prefer to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got any objections to the taking of the oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">C CHISOMA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> May I proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>	Mr Chisoma, are you 27 years old?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, I'm 27 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And you belong to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And during the 1990's you were a member of the SDU in Thokoza, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Who was your commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Meneer and Ben Mashile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairman, I think I've got to ask - the offences that this application applies for are in fact three offences.  They all relate to the same incident, that is the kidnapping, the murder of Mr Zulu and possession of an AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Murder of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Mr Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Z-U-L-U.  May I proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And the third one is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Illegal possession of an AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what was the second one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Murder of Mr Zulu.  Kidnapping, murder and possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say it's all one incident really?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Yes, correct.  May I proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>	Mr Chisoma, you're applying for amnesty for the kidnapping, murder of Mr Zulu and possession of an AK47, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Where did Mr Zulu live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> 611 Extension 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And who was Mr Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> He was a member of IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I see.  Now what orders did you get from your commanders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> They said we must kill any member of Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I see.  Now relating to this incident with Mr Zulu, in what year did it occur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> In 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And approximately in which month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> I can't remember very well, I think it was between March or April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Now who was with you on this day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Joseph Tamo, Veli Tsotetsi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Now describe in your own words what happened on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> It was on a Saturday morning, it was myself, Joseph and Tamo and Veli Tsotetsi.  We went to Mr Zulu's house and we took him from his house ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he go voluntarily or did you have to force him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> We forced him because he didn't want to come with us because we knew him as an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> We took him to Mbatha's house.  This house had already been damaged and Veli shot him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Veli shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Did you take part in the shooting as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> No, I had a gun as well but I didn't shoot him.  Joseph held his hands and Veli shot him, but I also had a gun with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you associate yourself with what they were doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, because I also had an AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No but even if you didn't have an AK, did you agree with what they were doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes.  He was an IFP member and I was an SDU, so we were all in this thing.  Joe held his hands and me and Veli we pointed the guns at him but only Veli shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Did you know that being in possession of an AK47 was illegal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And finally, Mr Chisoma, another applicant, Vusi Gazide: G-A-Z-I-D-E, he will mention that you had handed to him a pump-action shotgun in about 1990, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> It wasn't in 1990 when I gave him the gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Sure.  Which year was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> It was in 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was that person that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Vusi: V-U-S-I Gazide: G-A-Z-I-D-E.  His application number is 7684/97.  It will be a matter heard in chambers.  Thank you, Mr Chairman, that is the evidence-in-chief for the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SAMUELS</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> No questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR SWANEPOEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:</span> Mr Chisoma, besides the fact that Mr Zulu was an IFP member, was there anything else that he had done or said that led you to killing him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> We knew him from 1990.  The reason we left our places and ran away, it was because of them, it was because of the IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> No, I'm asking about Mr Zulu specifically.  Was there anything that he himself had done, who had participated perhaps in the activities of the other IFP members, that led to people having to leave their homes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why was it necessary to kill him, as opposed to telling him he must stop it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> It wasn't easy to tell an IFP member to stop.  We knew him as an IFP member and the reason we ran away in 1990 was because of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I know that but did Mr Zulu do any specific - I mean, if you killed Mr Zulu, would the IFP's power be reduced?  What purpose did his death serve?  Was he a leader of some sort or something like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> He was just a member of IFP, I won't know if he was a leader or not but he used to go to every Inkatha meeting.  We used to see them.  I was staying in Extension 2 and he was staying there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> What they were doing to us in 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you killed him, when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> In 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you killed him for something he did in 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> He was still a member of IFP and he was still participating as a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what was he doing as a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> When they attacked Polla Park, he was one of them.  We knew him all along as an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm not interested in whether he was an IFP member or not, I want to know if there is any other reason, other than his membership of the IFP, that he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> He ran away when we wanted to kill him and when he came back we got hold of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> When did he run away?  You didn't mention this in your evidence-in-chief.  Is the same incident or is it a separate incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well let's put it this way, what has his running away got to do with the matter?  If he ran away then he wasn't a threat to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> In his house there were too many Inkatha members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> People from Polla Park came and burn down the shacks in his house and that's when the violence started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you have any other private matter against him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> The only thing I know about Mr Zulu is that he was a member of IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And so you killed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, we were given orders that we should try to eliminate Inkatha members in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Why did you choose him specifically?  I mean, he's the only person that you've applied for, so there must have been a reason for you choosing him specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> That's because he was the only one we got hold of.  If we could have got other members we would have killed them as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I have difficulty in accepting that.  You went to his house to kidnap him, surely he was not the only IFP member you knew?  Is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Others were ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If there was only one IFP member in Polla Park then there wouldn't be a war, would you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Others ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you go to another IFP member's house, why Mr Zulu specifically is the question?  Why didn't you kidnap somebody else, another member of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> In my section it was only Mr Zulu who was an IFP member, the rest had run away at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it took four years to go and kidnap him?  He must have been very illusive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> ...(no English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't get that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Would you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How come then if Mr Zulu was your target, that it took you four years, almost four years to get him?  He must have been very illusive, and if he was such a clever man to elude you, you catch him in his house.  It doesn't make sense.  Can you explain it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> In those years, 1990, IFP members were the ones with guns.  We didn't have guns, so we didn't even try but in 1994 it was easy for us because in those years we also had guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja.  1994, that's three years and some months after he was party to chasing you away from your home, was he still an active member of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, he was still an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what did he do that irritated you in 1994, the time he was killed more or less, in those few months or weeks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> It's what they've done in 1993.  Some of them ran away.  Those that I know from my section, it was Mduduzi and Mr Zulu and another man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did they do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> We used to call meetings in our section and they never wanted to co-operate with us or with the community, and they supported Inkatha and they would tell the community that they were not involved in those meetings.  And they had guns in those years, so we didn't have a chance to attack them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But why would you want to attack somebody who refused to come to a meeting?  What's wrong with saying I don't want to come to a meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> He had done a lot from 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's what I'm asking, what did he do that you didn't agree with?  You've told me now he refused to come to a meeting, that you didn't agree with, anything else that made him deserving of being killed and kidnapped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> He's done a lot.  We used to call meetings for youth and we never used to continue with those meetings because they would stop us, they never wanted the youth to hold meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How would they stop it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> They used to harass us.  They would come with guns and we would be scared and ran away because we were scared.  And in those years we didn't have guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.  So he was seen as the disruptive force of your democratic processes, like meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, he never agreed with what we used to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anything else you want to mention about what he did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> He will attend IFP meetings and I used to consider him as a leader because he never missed any IFP meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But at that stage, a few weeks before the election in 1994, because you killed him in March/April '94 and the election was in April '94, there was already an agreement at Kempton Park, that all political parties would participate in the election and that they could hold meetings, even the IFP, was it necessary at that stage still to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Meneer and Ben(?) had given us orders and they never came back to us to tell us to stop, therefore we didn't get that message that we should stop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When did they give you the order to kill him or to kill IFPs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> I'm not sure, I think it was four months before the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> But Mr Chisoma, Meneer testified here yesterday, he made no mention of this in his testimony.  If he had given you that instruction, surely he would have said it?  He didn't apply for this incident either, for having instructed you to go out and kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Sorry, may I be a bit difficult?  There's a distinct between what a person says: "Go and kill IFP member or IFP supporters" and "Go and kill Mr Zulu".  If Mr Xebe, Meneer, had specifically said that, in my submission that would have been an offence for which he would have had to apply for.  In the case ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) is the question, Mr Samuels, why even at this stage was he not told that, look here your co-applicant is going to say this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> No, that was my decision.  My submission is that if person gives an order as far back as four months ago and a general order, it in itself doesn't link that person to the offence and that is why I did not lead him on that specific - it was only one fact, I appreciate that.  In an attempt to be short and quick, I only focused on those issues that were led.  I appreciate that it's not evidence in relationship to the applications but if it counts at all, it was my specific decision not to testify on that point, just simply because it wasn't relevant to Mr Meneer's, Mr Xebe's application and I wanted to just be specific on those issues.  The hearing can consider that evidence whichever way it wishes, but that is my submission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Samuels, on a lighter note, I really enjoyed your remark "Mr Meneer", so he's now a double Meneer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Be that as it may, Mr Xebe yesterday did not mention that he, that there was a general order that he had given out for IFP members to be killed, regardless of whether there's a link between that general order and a specific incident, as this applicant is applying for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you able to explain why he never mentioned it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Would you please repeat that one for me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The Evidence Leader has asked you why Meneer did not mention that he had been party to giving a general instruction for the destruction of IFP and their members in the area, are you able to explain why he never mentioned it, or can't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> I don't know how to answer this question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, it's simple, can you explain why he didn't mention it, or can't you, or do you think it's his business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> He only talked about one incident, he didn't mention the one of Mr Zulu.  I don't know why he didn't mention that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> After killing Mr Zulu, did you report back to Mr Meneer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, we went to his house afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And what was his attitude, what did he say about the killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> We told him in passing, and the soldiers were behind us, we were running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Ja, but did he approve of it, did he say it's alright that you did it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> He only asked us if we've killed him for sure and we told him yes, we have already shot Mr Zulu and we ran away, we were looking for cover.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Mr Chisoma, do you really want us to believe that the only person whom you were involved in the killing of, that you chose to report back to your commander whilst you were running away from the police, and that this serious matter was discussed under those circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> We were running from danger zone to the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And you chose that particular time to report back to him, whilst you were running?  I put it to you that Meneer probably doesn't even know of this incident and that is why he didn't mention it, and that there was no order or instruction to go out and kill IFP generally, from Meneer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Meneer knows about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Alright, thank you, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you kindly clear up your answer on page 87.  You were asked</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>"Did you benefit in any way financially or otherwise?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>And you said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>"Yes."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>What benefits did you receive, or what did you try to convey to us there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> This is a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You didn't write it yourself, or did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> I was writing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But you've made a mistake there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, I've made a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Did you understand the question asked there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> I think I didn't understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now Mr Ben, did you tell him about the killing of Zulu, because you said you got the instructions from Meneer and Ben?  Now you've told us that you told Meneer, did you tell Ben, Mr Ben?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Meneer reported to Ben on our behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Were you present when he did so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> There's no-one else who would have told Ben, Meneer was the one who was telling Ben.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Are you thinking that, or are you assuming that Meneer would have conveyed that to Mr Ben?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> I know because Meneer was the one who was attending meetings, and he would go back and report everything to Ben.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> You said Mr Zulu was amongst the people who attacked Polla Park, do you recall saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> You saw him in that crowd that was attacking Polla Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Mr Zulu was staying in my section and I would see him all the time, so I've seen him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> I see.  In the crowd that was attacking Polla Park, I assume it was IFP attacking Polla Park, but I mean, did you see him in that crowd going to Polla Park to attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, I've seen him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Did you see anything that he did when he was amongst that crowd attacking Polla Park, did you see anything which Mr Zulu did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> They went and attacked Polla Park and they burnt houses in Polla Park, and he was one of the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Ja, but my question is simple, did you see him or did you not see him do anything?  I know you saw him in the crowd but did you see him - let's take it that houses were burnt, but did you see him doing so or didn't you see him do anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> If you are with people who are armed and who are attacking, obviously you are an attacker yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Chisoma, we will decide that.  The question is simple, that when you observed Mr Zulu in this crowd, did you see him do anything specific?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> I'm staying in Extension 2 and if you're going to Polla Park, there is no way you cannot pass Extension 2 and that.  So ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So when did you see him in the crowd then, did you not see him in the crowd?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> They will pass Extension 2 all the time and even if the police were trying to chase them away, they will come running.  So I've seen Mr Zulu among the crowd or among the attackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now did you see him doing anything specific while in that crowd?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> They were all armed, he was also armed and he was among them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that all you can say about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> That's all I can say, that if you are armed and going to attack people, you are going to kill people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> And lastly, Mr Chisoma, turn to page 83 which will lap over to 84.  Did you understand question 8(a) because they are asking you there</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>"If you are/were an officer/officer bearer, employee of the State or any former State or if you are/were a member of the Security Forces of the State or any former State, state the Department/Division."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>And you ...(indistinct) employer."</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>That's your answer to that question:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>"Your employer."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>Did you understand what was required of you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> I used to work at Coca Cola company.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Do you understand the word: "Employer", what it means?  What does it mean?  Don't just nod your head because we've got a machine and it doesn't record the nods.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Now I understand, it means "Employer".</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> So you were none of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> In 1993 I was working for Coca Cola company.  It was a contractual post.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Do you know the difference between an employer and an employee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> You mean and employer and an employee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Ja, that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> I think I know the difference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When was the attack on Polla Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Would you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When was the attack on Polla Park, which year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> From 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> No, but this one you spoke of where you saw Mr Zulu in the company of the people who were attacking Polla Park, when was that?  We don't want generalities here because you mentioned a specific incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, it was in 1990.  At that time we didn't have guns in the townships.  They were the ones with guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Samuels, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I close my case for this applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Mr Chairperson, if I may, the victims's daughter is present.  I just wanted to place her details on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You take the details and give it to us when we're finished all the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>	Mr Chisoma, I just want to point out to you that we are not a Court of law, we don't represent the Courts, especially those before 1994.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And therefore you mustn't think you are on trial.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I get the feeling, during your testimony, that you want to prove a case and there are times that you don't want to answer certain questions that are very simple to answer.  Now I'm not going to ask you why, I'm going to give you another opportunity to answer one specific question.  We're trying to help you but we can't help you if you're not giving us the reasons to help you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>	During any of these marches or attacks in which Mr Zulu was a party, did you see him do anything specific?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> No, I didn't see him attacking as such but I've seen him armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he was part of a group that were armed, and you assumed that they would attack because they were armed?  It's a fair conclusion to come to, I must add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Yes, he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And how often did you see him in a group like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> I would often see him going with them and more especially going to IFP meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now I am sure that there were other people who were also in a similar position, that you would have seen going to these meetings and you would seen present and armed in these marches or gatherings of the IFP members, why did you choose Mr Zulu as a person to be kidnapped and killed, why not anybody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> I couldn't recognise others because others had ran away.  Mr Zulu was in my section so it was easy for me to recognise him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.  Thank you, you're excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry, could I just ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>	How old was Mr Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> He was big, I can't tell his age.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was he an elderly man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHISOMA:</span> Not that old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">WITNESS EXCUSED:</span> CHAIRPERSON:   Is that all your applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Mr Chairman, ...(inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> ...(inaudible) three persons were prisoners and a few days later we in fact were informed that they in fact had been released and they were no more prisoners and therefore we should try and trace them in the normal method that we try.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>	I've just been instructed this morning that in fact we found out that two persons are still prisoners.  So in fact I think there may have been crossed wires between the two sides.  For that reason, and I know that I've been given until 11 o'clock this morning ...(end of tape) </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>	...(inaudible) if we don't my suggestion is that all matters that I haven't consulted with, I'm prepared to have those matters adjourned sine die and they can the place in the roll at any stage. </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>	I'm reluctant to withdraw persons whom I haven't consulted with because I don't know what a person is going to tell me in relation to the very general statements that person made in their papers.  That is my only reason why I wish to ask for one last adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Patel, those three people, were they given notice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> If I may, Honourable Chairperson, Brian Kopedi from the ANC TRD desk had undertaken responsibility for services of all the notices for these matters.  We were given no indication up until recently, that these persons weren't located.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>	My instructions late last week was that these persons were in fact paroled and that we couldn't locate them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Well Mr Samuels will have to answer for that.  They take the instructions from ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Sorry, I didn't hear the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is Mr Kopedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> If a person is out on parole, the officials must have his address because a person on parole should report frequently.  So they must be able to trace them unless they've broken their parole rules and then they could even be rearrested.   That may be the case, but it wouldn't solve our immediate problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see this apparent disrespect for this process has gone beyond just an irritation.  In their favour I must say, one doesn't know whether they did in fact receive notice but at the same time I don't want to over-extend this hearing, it's not really our fault.  Mr Kopedi is the address chosen and by agreement he is supposed to do what is necessary.  How long do want to find out where they are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> If we have today, and by 9 o'clock - without any witnesses, I will be here to give an answer to a convened Court or hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why can't a couple of phone calls sort this out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Oh, we can try right now, yes, we will.  I will keep you updated at 11 o'clock and at 1 o'clock and equally when we close this afternoon ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I said, just hold your horses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> We had a contact number at Correctional Services, the TRC.  I don't what's his name, is he still operating and could he assist us perhaps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> I will endeavour to get hold of our Investigative Unit who will make the necessary arrangements if possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)  It's going to help me make a decision also.  Of these three people, are there any one or more of them that have been mentioned during evidence that has gone by?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So if they are involved in hearable matters, it will be on their instructions only, not because other people had mentioned them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I certainly hope Mr Kopedi is not going to charge for the days of this hearing because he's put in no work.  Ja, I hope that is conveyed to him, Ms Patel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> I'll ensure that it is.</p>
