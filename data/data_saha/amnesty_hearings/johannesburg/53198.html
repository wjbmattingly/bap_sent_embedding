<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the first one?</p>

<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> When did you join?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> In 1991 or 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> For which Section were you a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Mlangeni Section, that is also called (indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Okay, you indicated during our consultation that at a later stage, you were deployed in Slovo Section, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Who were your Commanders in these two Sections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Mt Mlangeni Section it was Vusi Malinga, at Slovo it was Suzi, I do not know his surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> In your application form you indicated that you are applying for amnesty for killing three people.   Just tell us about the first incident.  When did it happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> The first one took place in 1993, around September.  I was at Mlangeni Section, I was coming from Slovo Section.  When I was there, I heard gunshots at Slovo Section.  I went back to Slovo Section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>	When I arrived there, the other comrades were with this well known person who used to be seen during the fights between the IFP and ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Then what happened on your arrival there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> The other comrades had this person, he was captured by the other comrades.  He was taken to Nhlapo Quntu.  He was stabbed, he was also assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>	They told me that they were looking for me because they needed a spade, they were actually referring to an AK47.  I had to go and fetch this AK47.  When I arrived there, he was already shot with a pistol on his head.  I realised that this person was already dying, therefore I decided to do nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>	I left.  On my way out of that house that belonged to Khumalo in Tokoza, comrade Bkeki came and he told me that this person was trying to wake up.  I went back and I saw him trying to hold on the fence and I shot at him.  I shot him at the back.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>	I shot him behind his head, just on the neck.  I saw him falling.  I came closer and I shot him on the head and he was quiet after that.  I left the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> You mentioned earlier that this person was known to be an IFP member.  What information did you have to confirm that this person was an IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> As we were fighting with the IFP members, when they used to appear from their site, shooting at our direction, I used to see this person.  I knew him, he would appear and shoot at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>	He had an R4 rifle.  He would come and shoot, directing at us, and we used to identify him with his red head band, that is why I was sure that that was the person, because I used to see him closer as he would be shooting next to Buthelezi Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> On this particular day, did he have the red head band?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> When I arrived, the band was not on his head, but the comrades had this red head band.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> So you said you knew this person, you saw him on previous occasions, but you do not know his name, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Yes, I did not know his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Okay.  Can you remember who were present when this incident happened, your fellow comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Comrade Bayo and Mzwake.  I cannot remember the others, those are the only two people that I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> The second incident, where did it take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> That took place at Nhlapo Street.  We were patrolling there.  A boy of about 18 years old, appeared and he came closer and we were watching him.  He turned, he took a turn at Buthelezi Street and we went straight to him and we captured him, and we questioned him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>	We wanted to know what it was that he was looking for, because he was coming from the other side.  He said he was there, his brother brought him there, because there was a job for him, this job that was to be done at Buyafuthi.  He said there was a firm or a factory that was at Buyafuthi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>	We captured this boy and we searched him.  In his hand, he had a piece of paper with the medicine inside and in his pocket, he had some small bottles containing muti.  We took him, we said we are going to show him where Buyafuthi was.  We took him down Gubeni Street and I was the one who was holding him.  I questioned him further and I asked him what is it that he knows about this particular firm.  He said he was not certain or he was not sure what was happening there, but I told him that the firm, the factory that he was talking about, it was the place where they were killing the people, because that was a well known rumour that the people from Buyafuthi were fetching people to kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>	They were taking people to kill and I asked for a cigarette from Bizo and I instructed him to hold this young man.  I handed over this young boy to Bayo when I was trying to lick my cigarette.  I was this young boy running away, he escaped from Bayo's hands and he ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>	Bizo had an AK47.  I grabbed that AK47 from Bizo, I knelt down and when he was about to take a corner, I shot him.  We ran after him and he was already falling.  I shot him on the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>	When I left there, I went back to Nhlapo Street.  I don't know what happened thereafter.  I later realised that he died.  The other comrade decided to set him alight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> So the fact that this person said to you that he was looking for the hostel Buyafuthi and he has been promised a job there, what impression did you get?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> What came to my mind was this, this person was there, he was on his way to Buyafuthi to kill because during those times, people would be fetched from kwaZulu Natal to the hostels and those people would kill people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> After you shot him, you said you left.   When you left, was he already dead?  Did you notice whether he was dead or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> When I left that scene after shooting him, I saw that he couldn't survive, because I shot him right in the head and the way he was bleeding, to me that was a sign that he was going to die.  Therefore I left the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> You said you also used an AK47 on this particular incident, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> The third incident, where did it happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> We were patrolling with the other comrades at Slovo Section.  There was a place that was declared a no-go zone after Buthelezi Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>	This woman came from another direction.  We were at Khumalo Street and then she came down Mdagani Street.  We had information previously that there was a person who was coming down the street, and we should monitor that particular person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>	When she came, she came down Buthelezi and she went up once again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> You said you got information that there was a person that you should monitor.  From who did you get this particular information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> There were comrades who were stationed at Mdagani Street and they sent a boy to come and tell us that there was a person that was coming down Mdagani Street, who was about to take a turn at that particular point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>	We waited for her and she went, she took a turn.  She went up to the upper direction.  We decided to take a chance and walk through the no-go area to see where this person was actually going to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>	When we did that, going to that no-go area, when we were about to reach Khumalo Street, we took cover in another house.  We saw this person.  There was a group of Inkatha members with AK47's.  She talked to them and we saw her talking to these IFP members with AK47's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>	We saw these people pointing towards Mdagani Street as if they were going to walk down Mdagani Street, and to Buthelezi Street.  When she took another turn, we saw these people jumping over to Mdagani Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Then what happened thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You saw them pointing towards Mdagani Street and they entered Mdagani Street, is that where you were?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Yes, we were in Mdagani Street, in one of the circles.  Mdagani  Street was facing Khumalo and when we saw them, they came from the third house from where we were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>	When we went in there, we went back to Buthelezi Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Sorry, did they then enter Mdagani Street, these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Yes, they went through Mdagani Street and they went towards another direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Where did this woman go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> She took a turn, she went through Khumalo Street, to Buthelezi Street.	When she arrived next to Buthelezi, we were on the other side and prevented her from going further because we told them, we had told the other people that the woman was coming from those people who were our enemies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>	They captured her and we took her to Nhlapo Street and we questioned her.  She said she was looking for a church, Masango Church, Apostolic Church, the St John's Apostolic Church and we promised her that we were going to direct her to the church, but we raised our suspicions but we decided to direct, to give her directions to Masango.  We took her to Ngubeni Street and we directed her to go through Mavimbela Street and then we told her that when she reaches Mavimbela, she has to ask some people that would show her to the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>	We decided that another group of people must go straight and check if this woman was really getting to this St John's Apostolic Church.  We decided to wait at a second house and we waited for these people to give us information about this woman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>	When she was about to reach the veld in front of the furrow, she took a turn again, she went towards Mapanzela School and now it looked like she was going to this group of people. </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>	She was facing the Dube Street where the Inkatha people were staying.  She took another turn, going towards that direction and we decided to get out of that second house.   Basdi had a 7.65 pistol.  I grabbed that firearm and I went straight to this woman and she ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>	I called her and when she looked back, she saw us and she ran away.  In that process I shot her from behind.  She fell.  I came closer and I shot her for the second time.  I shot her on the head and I left the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Okay, the fact that you saw this woman coming from the no-go area and the fact that you saw her talking to IFP people, what impression did that make in your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> What came to my mind at that particular time, because we were watching her, we wanted to know what was happening, and when we found her talking to these people, and these people now were telling her where to go and they were going to take another direction, I told myself that this woman was a spy and she was sent down to check the situation and our base where we were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> In your application form, you mentioned on page 3 that all these people were killed and then burnt.  Were you present when the bodies were burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> The other two people, the first one and - the males, the first one and the second one, when their bodies were set alight, I was not present, but this woman, after deciding to go back to Ngubeni Street, I met with the other comrades who had petrol and I went back to the scene and I saw them pouring petrol over her body and they set her alight.  I did not participate in setting her alight, I just stood there and watched them setting her body alight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> The last victim, you also do not know her name and particulars, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> No, I know nothing about her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Who were present when this incident took place, your fellow comrades?  Can you remember who was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> I remember that Mqunu was there, Basdi was also there and I cannot remember the other people who were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> In our consultation you also mentioned Nkosana, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Nkosana is the one who is also called Basdi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I have nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS NHLAYISI</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> No questions, thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> In your application you also mention that Mpegeleli and Nqedesi were also there.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> I am referring now to the boy you met who said he was going to Buyafuthi.  If he was not connected to the IFP, was it possible for him to stay at Buyafuthi Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> No ways, that was not possible for him to be there, because during the violence, the only people who would stay at Buyafuthi was the IFP members.  The people from the township wouldn't set their foot at Buyafuthi Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Where did he say he came from, where was his home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> He said he was coming from kwaZulu Natal, Inhandla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you Chair.  The same incident, the chap from Inhandla, where was he stabbed and assaulted, in Nhlapo Street or Nhlapo Section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> He was not stabbed, he was shot.  The only one who was stabbed, was the one that used to be among the Inkatha members during the fight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Oh, I beg your pardon, you are quite right.  It is the first incident I am looking at.  The chap who had been captured by the time you got there, that is the one i am talking about.  Where was it, at Nhlapo Section or Nhlapo Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Nhlapo Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Street?  In respect of the chap from Inhandla this time, were you saying it was Bayo you were with, I was not sure of the name, was it Bayo?  You were with Bayo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Bayo, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Okay, and then the last one is the woman, Mdagani Street and Buthelezi Street are very close?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> Yes, they are close.  They are in the form of a T-junction, Mdagani is going through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Okay, then that solves my problem there.  Just give me a minute, and then finally the same woman, when they set her body light, was she still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKHOSANA:</span> No, she was already dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, that concludes my roll.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, Mr Sibeko will be taking over from Ms Nhlayisi.</p>
