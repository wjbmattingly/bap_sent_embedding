<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Mr Chairperson I call Mogoera Valentine Modikoa, application number 7212/97.  His application is on page 142 of Volume 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Modikoa, what language do you choose to use here?</p>

<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SAMUELS:</span> Mr Modikoa, do you belong to a political party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> You are applying for amnesty for the offences of arson, attempted murder and kidnapping, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Let's talk about the arson.  Can you tell us when this occurred and who was the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> It was in 1993, it was at night.  We went to Ben - Sibongele Sambo's house.  The house number is 9381, that is Sibongele Sambo's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Why did you burn Sibongele Sambo's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Sibongele was a member of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Who were you with and who ordered you to burn Sibongele's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> We received an order from Meneer.  I was with Jango, Mdmase and M'Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Repeat the names please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> That is myself, Jango, Mdmase and M'Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> What did you use to burn the house with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> We used petrol bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Tell me, when you burnt the house was there anybody present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes, they were present in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Who was present that you know of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> That is Sibongele Sambo was present in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Did you think by throwing a petrol bomb onto her house that you could endanger her life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes I knew very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Now let's talk about the kidnapping incident.  Can you tell us when that occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> That's Sibongele Sambo.  A month after the arson we went to fetch her from Section 5.  We informed her to go with us then she denied therefore we decided to take her by force to Section 2.  When we arrived there, Ben Mashinini who was the commander, it was myself, Vuyisili and Jabu.  Then Mashinini instructed us that because we were not armed we should return.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> What did you then do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> We returned back.  We waited for those who went with her to find out what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Did you know that when you were told by your commander Ben Mashinini to leave the house, did you know that Sibongele and her sister would be attacked by your comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> May you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Sorry.  When you were told to leave along with Vuyisile and Jabu, did you know what was going to happen at the house after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> I did not know Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Thank you, I have no more questions Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SAMUELS</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you think was going to happen there, were they going to have a party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> I thought they were going to be questioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> About what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> About their involvement with IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Swanepoel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR SWANEPOEL:</span> May it please you, Mr Chairman.  How far apart from the others, apart from each other were your involvements in the two incidents pertaining to Sibongele?  How far apart in time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> It's a month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> So you were involved in two incidents pertaining to Sibongele in a space of one month apart from each other and you testified that knew her well, is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes I knew her well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Now look at your application on page 144.  Let me first ask you, who filled out this application, whose handwriting is this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> There was somebody who was filling in that form but I was instructing him what to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What's the name of this person filling in a form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> That is George, I don't know his surname Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> But you instructed him what to fill out here, what to write here on this paper, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Then why do you say under the question</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>"State whether any persons was injured, killed or suffered any damage to the property as the result of such acts?"</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>"Yes, but I don't know their names, they were killed when we were defending.  Why is that?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> May you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> I want to know from you, if you knew Sibongele well and you were involved in two attacks in the space of one month at the same premises on this person, why don't you disclose her name in your application?  Is it perhaps because when you filled out this application you did not have this specific incident in mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> I knew that it was Sibongele.  I did not know her sister's identity.  I filled these forms after I've received their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Did you have the incident that you gave evidence about or the incidents that you gave evidence about in mind when you gave George instructions to fill out these forms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> I was not writing about those two incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were not writing about them did you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Chairperson, the interpreter suspects that the applicant doesn't hear correctly, maybe if they can change his earphones?  He must be on channel 3, please put him on channel 3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you able to hear properly now?  Are you able to hear properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You should answer, the machine can't take up your nodding of your head, so you say yes or no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Can I start from the third question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of the mechanisms are operating properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Yes they do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now can the witness hear from the phones what is being asked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes I do hear now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now the most important question that is being recently asked is when you filled in this form, or when this form was being completed, were you talking or were you referring to the incidents relating to the burning and attempted murder as you referred to in respect of Miss Sibongele Sambo and a month thereafter the kidnapping, were you referring to those incidents after you completed the application or some other incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes I was referring to them because we filled this form after we did those incidents then at that time when I filled this form I didn't know their identity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I thought you said when you got the order to go kidnap then you knew who you must go kidnap, no so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes I knew that we were going to Extension 5 but I did not have the full information about the identity of the person we're going to kidnap.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who were you going to kidnap?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> I only heard when the commander instructed us that we should go and kidnap Sibongele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) knew he was talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> I knew that the commander knew the person, he has the full information about the identity of that person.  CHAIRPERSON:   I'm talking about you, did you know who he was talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> No, I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did you find out who Sibongele was by name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> I knew after - when we were filling, after we had filled the forms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>	Now the first attack, the arson attack that you carried out on Sibongele's house, who did you receive your orders from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> On arson the order came from Mr Meneer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> And at that stage who was the commander of Section 2 or Extension 2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> It was both Meneer and Ben Mashinini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Now when you threw the petrol bomb to Sibongele's house, you said you knew she was inside, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes, I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Was anybody else inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> I did not know as to whether there were other people in the house but we knew that Sibongele was in the house but we did not know as to whether there were other people in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Did you look yourself?  Did you look through the window before you threw the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> How did you know only Sibongele was in the house or how did you know Sibongele was in the house, who told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> There were members of Inkatha who were drinking alcohol in the house therefore I knew that they would not entertain themselves in her house in her absence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> So you knew that there were other people who you say were members of the Inkatha Freedom Party in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> They would entertain themselves during the day and they left.  I did not know as whether all of them left the house but we had the belief that Sibongele was in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Who told you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But if they've left early and you don't know when they've left, how would you know whether she's still there or whether she left with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> They were in the car, we were watching when the car left then we confirmed that he was not inside the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Alright, you received orders to go and burn a house while you knew she was inside and you're applying for Amnesty for attempted murder.  Is that in respect of that offence of the house burning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> So your instructions was to go and kill her by burning the house in which she was at that stage, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Now did you hear whether you succeeded or not?  Where did you hear she was still alive the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> I knew the following day that she survived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> So would it be correct to say that approximately a month later when you got instructions to kidnap her, you were aware of the fact that your leadership wanted her dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> May you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Am I correct to say that when you got the instructions approximately a month later to go and kidnap her, you were aware of the fact that your leadership wanted her dead.  In fact you already tried to kill her once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes, yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Now why do you tell the Commission that you were under the impression that you were to kidnap her to take her away for questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> When we tried to inform her that she should go with us, she denied then therefore we had to kidnap her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Yes, but how did it come that you believed that she was to be taken away for kidnapping - for questioning and not to be shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Because he had claimed that he was a member of the ANC and she was lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> What was the accusation against Sibongele?  Why did you have to kill her when you threw the petrol bomb at her house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> It's because members of the IFP were burning members of the ANC in the community therefore we had to retaliate by burning an IFP members house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Wasn't it general knowledge amongst both you and your comrades, the members of the group that were instructed to kidnap Sibongele that she was a person whom your leadership wanted to be dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> May you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Wasn't it common knowledge amongst you and your comrades that your leadership wanted Sibongele dead when you went to kidnap her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Do you say it was common knowledge that our leadership wanted Sibongele to be killed when we kidnapped her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> I'm asking you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Listen could you kindly listen now.  She was regarded as an enemy of the ANC is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you received orders to act against her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And the first order was to burn her house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And if she's inside the house she should be killed with the burning, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you knew that this person being seen as an enemy should be killed at one stage or another?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> At the time when we were throwing the petrol bombs to her house, we wanted to kill her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and therefore at the time you kidnapped her you knew that the ANC wanted her dead, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> At the time when we kidnapped her I knew that she was going to be interrogated about her claim that she's a supporter of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you knew they wanted to kill her a month before already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes, at that time I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it's not an issue of a question that you only thought they want to question her, you knew in all likelihood she was going to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes I knew that there was that possibility for her to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> And further, was it not for the fact that you did not carry a gun that day, you would have been present at the attack on her, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes I would take part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Now just one point that came up now.  How did you know she was going to claim to be an ANC supporter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you misunderstand Mr Swanepoel.  The day of the kidnapping, somehow she had already made that assertion and she was going to be questioned about this assertion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> As you please Mr Chairman.  I have nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SWANEPOEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:</span> When you received your orders, can you tell us exactly what Meneer had said to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> You mean about the order for assault or for the kidnapping?  It was at night in 1993, as I've explained that I was with Jango and Mdmase and Mafrica.  We arrived at her place ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Never mind about that, Ms Patel will probably ask you about that just now.  What did Meneer say must happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> He instructed us to go and burn that house, that's what he said to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he say whether Sibongele must die or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please, that's what we're asking, the full instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And regarding the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> He instructed us that we should throw petrol bombs in that house so that she should be burnt together with her house because as supporters of the IFP we were burning the houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Did he explain that that is why you were to go and burn her house and kill her if possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did he give you the name of the person whose house you should go and burn and who should be killed with the burning?  Did he mention any name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> He told us that we should go at Sibongele's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did he specifically say that you should go to Sibongele's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you knew whose house it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes as he has mentioned the name and again the house number I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So before you acted you knew her name and before you kidnapped her you knew her name, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes but I did not know the identity of Sibongele, I only knew the name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So when you filled in this form you knew her name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> I knew the name but I did not know the identity of the person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When you kidnapped her you had the name and you had the person together so you knew the name and the identity because here you have got the two together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> I will say it for the second time, I forgot her name because everytime I when I was filling these forms I was filling them with somebody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> At the time of the kidnapping what were your specific instructions then from Meneer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> He said we should talk with her peacefully and take her from Extension 5 to Extension 2 and go with her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Who did he say should talk with her unless specific instructions regarding that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> No she did not mention a person responsible for talking to her it's an order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> So in terms of the general order the possibility existed at that stage that you might have been one of those people who would have questioned her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Given that at the stage when you received the order to kidnap, right, you say that Meneer gave a general order that she should be questioned.  What I'm putting to you is that there is then given that, there's the possibility that you would have been one of those people who would have questioned her, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, so the order was not only for you to kidnap, the order was for you to question her as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> The instruction was that we should go and take her at her place at Extension 5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> No, that wasn't my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you supposed to question her as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> We arrived and informed her that we should leave, then she denied therefore we had to take her by force to Extension 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, let me try again.  After she was supposed to be kidnapped, what did Meneer say should happen to her exactly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Mr Chairperson, if I may interject here.  According to my client's instructions or according to his evidence in chief he testified that the incident of the kidnapping was ordered by Ben Mashinini.  My learned friend is still I think leading him on the fact that Meneer gave the specific order whereas Meneer gave the order regarding the arson of the house which occurred a month before.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whoever gave the order for the kidnapping, were you supposed to have interrogated her as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> No, we tried to talk to her so that we should go to Extension 2, therefore that is why we had to take her by force.  We were not supposed to question her but just to instruct her to go with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Is all that Ben had said to you, that that was the full extent of your instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr Modikoa, at Extension 2 whose place was she supposed to be taken to at Extension 2, Extension 2 is a big place.  Precisely where at Extension 2 was she to be taken to?</p>

<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Whose house was that at Extension 5 where you were supposed to fetch her from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> I didn't know whose house was that in Extension 5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> So the number given I think 9381, was that number at Extension 5?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> That's Extension 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> This number is at Extension 2, that's her place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes, that is 9381 that is her house number.  That Extension 5, I didn't know whose house was that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> How did you find the place when you didn't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> We didn't know the house number in Extension 5.  The 9381 is her house number in Extension 2.</p>

<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Those were the orders of Mashinini that she must be questioned at her place and not be taken to Mashinini for instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MODIKOA:</span> Yes.</p>
