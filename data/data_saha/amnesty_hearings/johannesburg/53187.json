During those years, that is in 1985, COSAS was banned.\n\tAs I was a member of the Executive Committee in COSAS, many members were detained.   I had to leave school and leave my area, the community where I lived.  Then I left school.  I went to hiding.  At that time, I was staying in Tokoza, but I was attending school at Letutula Secondary School.  I looked for employment.  In the township I was a member of Tokoza Youth Congress as from 1987, 1988. \n\tI was compelled to look for employment as to support my family.  I found employment at Early Bird TV Services.  Whilst I was working there at Early Bird, I was detained by members of the Security Branch.  It was during the time of the state of emergency.\n\tAfter I was released, I was restricted.  I was confined to my house, so that I should not roam around in the township without notifying the police.  I was not supposed to be amongst people who were more than three, unless it was at church or members of my family.  \n\tBefore I leave Tokoza township, if I go to my relatives or wherever I go, I've got to give them an address of where I will be going, and the telephone numbers of the place I was visiting.  They would verify before I leave.\n\tThat happened for a month.  After that, I defied those restrictive orders.  I didn't go to the police station to sign weekly.  I defied those orders and moved freely.\n\tFrom 1988 up to 1989, it happened that whilst I was in Early Bird TV Services, members of the Security Branch went there to bribe my girlfriend so that she will lay a charge of rape.\n\tI was prosecuted for rape.  On the final day in court, she exposed the members of the Security Branch that they bribed her, and that she was lying, that she must lay a charge, therefore I was acquitted by Magistrate Van Wyk in Germiston.\n\tWhen I returned to Early Bird where I was working, my employer told me that because I was arrested for rape, I am working with female employees, therefore they terminated my services.  I worked in the township with Tokoza Youth Congress.  I was a member of Tokoza Civic Association at that time.\n\tI was taken by Bishop of the Anglican Church, who is Bishop Mokoene.  Because I did not have a steady place to stay and was not able to stay with my family, he got a scholarship from Britain so that I should go and further my studies there.\n\tI stayed with him in Benoni, I was working as a driver and as a field worker in the church until he died.",

As I was a Media Officer of the Youth League in Tokoza, there was a meeting because the war had started between hostel dwellers and the residents of Phola Park.  At the time the war started, it wasn't clear that it was a fight between the ANC and the IFP.\n\tEverybody observed that as a fight between Zulu's and Xhosa's.  On that meeting of the ANC Youth League, they said that amongst the members of the ANC Youth League and I was also the Chairperson of the Slovo Section, that we must form Self Defence Units.\n\tThe issue was referred to members of Umkhonto weSizwe.  The members of MK adopted me in that particular structure, which would form the Self Defence Units in all the sections.\n\tAfter the formation of those structures, we held elections for various positions within the Units, because at that time, members of the leadership of the ANC or members of the Executive in Slovo Section, people like Thabi Penqe, Vusi Sibeko, were attacked in their houses, and then I was left alone.\n\tPeople like Sam Ntuli, Dan Pumselo Mbatha and Tshabalala have already died at that time.  That is where we formulated the SDU structures.  Those people who were near the hostels, came to our sections and at times, they were threatened to join the IFP.\n\tThere were activities which I did with the SDUs until I was arrested in 1992, around September or October, I don't remember well.  After I was detained, I stayed in detention for some months.  In 1993, I learnt about what was happening in the township, especially in my particular Section.\n\tThose three months which I stayed in detention, six people or seven people, were killed by Bishop Khumalo's gang, who is a member of the IFP.  I was forced to get out of prison, because I was never granted bail.\n\tI was able to escape from prison for the first time.",
