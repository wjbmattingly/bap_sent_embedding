<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman in regard to the third applicant, William Mabele, in the light of the evidence which he'll give about his limited knowledge of what was going to happen and his limited role in the matter, may I ask for a short adjournment to discuss the matter with Mr Prior to see whether it is necessary to recall him at this opening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman we don't need to adjourn.  I mean it's clear from the evidence, which hasn't been challenged, Mr Mabele had a very limited role but I think the act requires that he gives some evidence relating to his role.</p>

<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR LANDMAN:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Mabele how old are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I am 30 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> During 1987 did you know Mr Joe Kgoele, the previous witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes I knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> How did you get to know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> He came to where we were repairing cars, he came to repair his car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> When you first got to know him did you know that he was an MK member, an operative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Do you recall an incident when he asked you to drive a car to the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Can you describe to the Committee what happened the day before you were asked to go to the Magistrate's Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> The day before we went to the Magistrate's Court Joseph Kgoele came to me at home and he collected me and we went to his hiding place.  When we arrived there there was a car, a white Golf.  Because I had a knowledge of certain issues on a car we checked as to whether the car would not stuck and give us problems on our way to the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court.  As I was busy checking the car he was busy putting some few things in the boot of the car.  I saw the things that he had in putting them in the car.  I stood aside and he got himself busy with some wiring.  After that he took me back home.  He said I should not leave home early the next morning I should wait for him, which I did.  He arrived the next morning, he took me to his home.  He gave me his car keys and he ordered me to follow him, to drive after him.  He drove in a Golf and we headed for the Johannesburg Court.  On our way he stopped me, he said I should stop somewhere and he would come back.  He went to park the car and he came back, took the car from me and we went back to Soweto.  He dropped me off at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>Before he left he said I should watch television during the news and I was not used to watching the news but on that day I stayed at home and when it was the time for the news, I saw the spot where a car was parked and when I realised how things were, I realised that it was the car that was driven by us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Mabele if I can just deal certain 	aspects of your evidence.  When you saw Mr Kgoele</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>putting things in the boot of the car, of the Golf and doing certain things to some wiring in the vehicle, what did you think that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I had a suspicion that there was something going on but I was not aware as to what exactly was happening, but I suspected that something was about to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Do you have any idea as to what it might be that might happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I did not know what could happen, but sometimes when we were watching television we would get reports of incidents that took place.  My suspicion was to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What sorts of incidents are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I'm referring to bomb blasts, there were reports such as bomb blasts at certain places and I was not used to such things, but I just suspected that it might happen but I did not even see the necessity of putting that into the car, to me it didn't sound - he would, at time he would come to me and say I bumped my car please help me and I would help him repair the car, I didn't suspect anything when he put things into the boot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> By the morning of the explosion when you drove the vehicle in the direction of the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court, were you aware that Mr Kgoele was an MK operative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> No I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Were you informed of that fact at a later stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes afterwards I came to know that he was an operative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What time in the morning did you drive to the Magistrate's Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> It was in the morning, between six and seven o'clock, if I remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Now precisely what did you see on the television that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I saw many cars that were destroyed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Were those cars in the vicinity of the Magistrate's Court were you had drive to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes they were near the vicinity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you at that stage, after watching television, believe that the vehicle which Mr Kgoele had used that morning was used for the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes I saw the car and I realised it was the one driven by Mr Kgoele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What did you do about that, did you speak to him or anyone else about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I did not discuss this with anyone.  I concluded as to what was happening because he had told me earlier on to watch television, but I never discussed this matter with anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you consider going to the police to inform them of what you knew about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I would have done the same as well but unfortunately I was not affected.  It happened one day that we attended a funeral to bury one of our students at school and the police arrived and they assaulted us, they shot rubber bullets and they arrested one of my friends and they assaulted him until he lost his eye.  Even to this day he doesn't have an eye.  That is why when I saw that on television I had no doubts because I was happy that the Whites would realise that as Black people we are in a position to revenge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you then, once you became aware of what had happened, support Mr Kgoele in what he had done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I was not supporting him, I was supporting the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you later leave the country for training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes I left the country to get training outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Which organisation provided you with training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Were you told by anybody that you should leave the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Joseph Kgoele came to me and told me that there was a need for me to leave and he told me that at any given moment it was possible for them to come and pick me up so it was necessary for me to leave because I also wanted to train.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LANDMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR WAGNER:</span> Mr Mabele when the amnesty process was announced, did you yourself decide that you should now apply for amnesty or were you told by someone else that you should apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Shell House did not have a contact with me, they had to contact Joseph Kgoele, that was when I applied for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Does this mean that you were approached by Joseph Kgoele and told that you should apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes, I did not have information to come here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> May I refer you to your written application, it is in Volume 1 from page 23 onwards.  Merely for the record Mr Chairman I see that this was also not a sworn statement.  May I refer you specifically to page 26, that is paragraph 10.b there at the top.  Do you have it in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes I have it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Only one question and I'm not sure what you're saying here.  Maybe I should ask you this.  Is this your own handwriting or did someone or did you tell someone else what should be written into your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> This is my handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Then can you please tell me in the second last line, the letters WM there, what does it stand for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> This is not WM, it's with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> So is the sentence then:  "To us Black people at that time ..." - maybe I should read it then complete - "The Magistrate's Court is one of the government institution which was used to enforce apartheid laws to us as Black people at that time with policemen", is that the word, "with policemen"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Now if I may take you back to page 23 you say that you were a member of Umkhonto weSizwe.  When did you joint Umkhonto weSizwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> In 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Was that before or after this operation which was also in 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> After the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Was that when Mr Kgoele told you that you should leave the country and then you left the country and you joined Umkhonto weSizwe in some foreign country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> On what day did you leave the country in relation to the bomb explosion, was it the same day, the next day, a week later.  Can you just help me there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I do not remember the day quite well, I do not even remember the date, but it was after a few weeks.  I do not remember whether it was after three or four weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> And in those three weeks did you and the people you were with discuss what happened at the Magistrate's Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I did not speak to anyone in those weeks.  This issue was known by myself and Joseph Kgoele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Were you a member of SOYCO (?) at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Mr Chairman I think it stand for Soweto Youth Congress.  SOYCO.  Did you attend any meetings of SOYCO in that period immediately after the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Mr Chairman so as not to confuse you, those questions were merely asked, I have information that the explosion was discussed in some detail at such a meeting, but I can't take it any further with this witness, there was nothing else intended by the question.  I have no further questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WAGNER</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> No questions thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Mr Mabele when Mr Kgoele said to you that you should watch TV news that evening, what did you think about that, didn't that surprise you someone telling you that you should watch news on TV tonight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I asked him why and he told me about his hatred to the "Boers" and I asked him why he targeted that place.  What he told me was the Magistrate Court was sentencing the Black people and he was a trained person, he knew that a policeman was an enemy and the government buildings were also targets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did he tell you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> That was after days, when he came to repair a car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question was, when he told you that morning to watch television, didn't you think it surprising?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes it surprised me because I did not know what to expect on the news.  I asked him why do I have to watch television today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> And what did he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> He said watch television, I did not actually ask him, he said watch television today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Did it ever happen to you before that someone asked you to watch television?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> It was the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you say you found that surprising?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> It surprised me because he told me to watch television at night, he didn't used to tell me to watch TV, but when he told me on that day to watch the news it surprised me and when I watched the news I got more surprised when I saw what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> At that time were you a member of any kind of organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I was an ANC supporter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> How did you go about supporting the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> When we had funerals I would attend the funerals and I would attend night vigils.  Sometimes at school, because of the harassment by the Whites, there were times where we would conduct discussions and there would be people among us who had knowledge about the ANC and Joseph Kgoele used to talk to me about the ANC at times, but not stating in details all the facts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> But I understand the ANC was still a banned organisation in 1987 Mr Mabele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes it was banned, but we knew about the ANC and I've already told you that there were people who had knowledge about the ANC and they passed it on to others and as they were talking one gained interest as to why is the ANC fighting and these are issues that we would be discussing and I realised that ANC was the right organisation to join.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you support any other organisation besides the ANC, I'm not talking about membership?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> No other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Mabele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand your evidence, and correct me please if I'm wrong, after you saw the television you realised that Mr Kgoele had set off the bomb which had damaged many cars and killed several policemen.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I did not see the policemen at that time, they only showed, only the damage to the cars was shown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You learned that many policemen had been killed and others injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> I did not know about the police.  I learned that when I applied for amnesty.  I did not know how many of them died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm not saying you knew how many, but you knew there had been an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you did not report it to the police because you supported what had been done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You yourself had suffered at the hands of the police and you felt that this was a justifiable action.  Is that the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is was politically justifiable, it would teach them a lesson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABELE:</span> Yes I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I'm sorry Mr Chairman there's one aspect that arises before my learned friend, I notice that at page 30 of the bundle in a letter to the Amnesty Committee Mr Mabele supplied certain further particulars and I just possibly, in fairness to him if he can comment on the first paragraph where he seems to suggest that he knew that the car that went to Jo'burg city had explosives in it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well he did know when he wrote this letter didn't he Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He's not saying I knew at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Oh I see, I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... (Inaudible) he left with the other car .. (inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes but it doesn't seem clear.  His evidence is that he didn't know at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Any further witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> No further witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Mr Chairman may I raise an issue.  I was requested by a gentleman here in the audience, although I don't formally represent him, to raise a quick aspect with you.  If you look at Volume 2 Mr Chairman, page 43, there's a list of vehicles damaged.  Actually the list starts at page 41.  Now this gentleman he's number 27 on page 43, Mr Erasmus and he is here and if I may refer you to page 57 as well Mr Chairman, the top photograph apparently that is his vehicle directly in front of the vehicle with the bomb, that is immediately to the right-hand side of the gentleman standing there.  His vehicle was extensively damaged and he's here to, he doesn't really know what he should do.   I said to him I'll raise this point on his behalf if he want to give evidence to you to tell the damages he suffered he's here.  I only said to him I'll raise the issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Erasmus did speak to me and I indicated that because he had sustained damage that would be highlighted before the Committee.  His vehicle was a write-off.  Apparently it was under HP and he had to pay, for some or other reason the insurance never paid and he sustained loss of approximately</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>R20 000,00.  I understand that's virtually common cause and ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I doubt that the extent of the damage can be common cause.  The fact that many vehicles were damaged I think is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman we don't contest that evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> If that can be conveyed, obviously Mr Erasmus is within earshot and is listening.  I don't believe that unless, that's it's necessary to lead viva voce regarding this aspect, it's common cause as I've suggested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well because Mr Erasmus is present that he indicated that his vehicle had been damaged, as is shown in the photographs, and that it was not contested on the part of the applicant that the damage could have been in the region of       R20 000,00.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I'm indebted to the Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Mr Chairman ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any of your other victims wish to say anything or ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Mr Chairman no, my clients they don't intend giving evidence here so I've got no witnesses to lead or evidence to tender.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman I have no further evidence to place before the Committee.  As I indicated earlier, except for Mr Erasmus, no other victim or witness has come forward in this matter so I ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not even the Chief Magistrate of Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman can I possibly just enquire via the Chair as to Mr Wagner's position at this stage.  I don't know whether at this stage he's reached any conclusions as to whether he continues to oppose the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know if Mr Wagner's in a position to tell us that now or whether he wants to talk to his clients?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Mr Chairman one aspect remains.  I was told by Mr Landman that he also represents General Nyanda.  Now to me that is the only outstanding issue and I'm not sure how we should go about this, but if General Nyanda for instance disputes the evidence given here today it may influence the matter even to the extent that we may request him to come and testify but if he is not in dispute, I would like via you to request my learned friend whether it can be put on record because that may have a very relevant bearing on the outcome of this hearing.  That's my personal view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know if you're in a position to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman we in fact are in a position to comment on that.  We appear for General Nyanda as an implicated person.  He is aware of the evidence, he's been present and has listened to the evidence and he does not contest the evidence which has been led about his role and about the rest of the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He is obviously, if represented by your instructing attorney, fully aware of his rights and that is that as an implicated party he can choose, if he so desires, to give evidence, to make representations, which through you he has indicated to us he does not do so and he does not wish to dispute the evidence that has been led here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> That is so Mr Chairman, as we've indicated earlier on, he has an application which still has to be dealt with and certainly it is correct he doesn't dispute what has been said today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that meets your problem Mr Wagner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> In that instance Mr Chairman if Mr Landman will bear with me, I will in fact just have to take instructions on the question of opposition and I will revert to him and Mr Prior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I'm going to suggest further that much as the thought of spending a day away from here attracts me, would it not be possible in this matter for us to hear addresses tomorrow morning and to dispose of this matter at least without the necessity of written arguments later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman we don't have any objection to that at all.  Would it be possible to start a bit later than 9 o'clock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Certainly because I don't think any of you are going to be very long in your addresses, I hope I'm not being unduly optimistic, but we could certainly start later.  What time would you suggest,  11?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Mr Chairman if I would obtain instructions to the effect of not opposing the application, would you still require me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No certainly if you notify Mr Prior he can notify us on your behalf.  It's only if you wish to oppose that you should have to be here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman would half past eleven be (indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman the other aspect which my attorney has raised, is that certain of the other Chairpersons of the Amnesty Committee have, before their addresses, indicated what areas the representatives ought to concentrate in particular, areas that might bother them.  Now I don't know whether the committee wants to make any comments in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think this ... (inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Certainly Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is not a matter whether ... (inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> That is so yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> ... (Inaudible) well to the extent that we reconvene tomorrow, it seems from the nature of these proceedings that the arguments are certainly not going to take up any length of time at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No let us ... (inaudible) some other day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> No not at all, just whether we needed to actually reconvene as a body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prior what we're seeking to avoid is further written argument which we have in hearing after hearing after hearing, which we get weeks after the hearing when we've all forgotten what it was all about.  Here we want to dispose of the hearing that's it's over and I think Mr Wagner has a great deal of experience with that and I see him nodding and I think Mr Landman would also like to be able to say at the end of this well that's over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> I certainly would Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If we go on with the other matter on Friday we don't want to delay that do we, because we could perhaps say we'll start this one for argument at nine o'clock on Friday morning and start the other one at ten, but if we start the other one at ten will we finish it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman it might be more convenient in fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It might be for everybody here ... (inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman there is another variable fact and that is whether Mr Van den Berg's going to come back and say that he's ready to proceed.  On the basis that he does proceed I think it's a very limited area where he'd have to lead his clients and there had be some cross examination.  I would imagine within 2 hours that could be disposed of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Inaudible).  We will not adjourn until tomorrow, we will now adjourn till 9 o'clock on Friday morning.</p>
