<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, excuse me, Mr Shane will be next.  I've already asked him to come in and be ready.  He tells me he will be ready.  He will be next Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	Mr Chairman I do apologise, I've asked him now again to be ready.  I phoned him again and tell him please to be ready at two o'clock, so we can start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there nothing else we can do in the meantime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> No Mr Chairman.  Mr Sibeko's client is only for tomorrow.  The rest of the clients of Ms Nhlayisi are in custody.  She still has to consult with them.  But Mr Shane's clients are here and he's supposed to be ready now sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) do tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman I would guess about four, four to five.  Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see there's left 11 applicants.  Will we finish the balance today, the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> The difficulty is some of the attorneys need still to consult with their clients Mr Chairman.  Some of them only started this morning to consult with them, but be that as it may.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I hope they're not going to charge for consulting, if they're charging for the day's appearance.  Yes Mr Shane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman I'd like to proceed with the application of Mr Antony Maci.  I do believe he's here.  I have consulted, I saw him, and I asked him to be here at two o'clock.  I told him we're going to start at two o'clock, I don't know where he is now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> ...(indistinct) that we can start with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well where were you at two o'clock, nevermind your client?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, call your client.  What happens to your other client that you wanted to call?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I don't know where he is Mr Chairman.  He's been here the whole morning, I told him to be here at two o'clock.  I don't know where he is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What happens to his application now?  It's been called.  You called it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Well if he comes I'll - if he can stand down and if we can proceed with Mr Booi who's now before you Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I hope this standing down procedure is not taken for granted.  I may just be in a bad mood and not grant it.  What's the name of this client?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shane will you put your speaker on please?  Your speaker, yes.  Mr Shane what you said now was not picked up by the tape recorder, because your speaker wasn't on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman this is the application of Mr Daniel Mahese Booi, reference number AM 7561/97 on page 81.  Mr Chairman if I can just know the number of the Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Number four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Booi I understand you want to testify in Sotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you any objection to the taking of the oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">DANIEL MAHESE BOOI:</span> (sworn, states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Mr Booi don't worry about that mike, it will stay on now.  Don't worry about pressing again, it will just stay on permanently.  Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SHANE:</span> Mr Booi your identity number is written on your application 730405 5419 08 8.  Is that the right number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Booi you applied for amnesty for murder of Mr Dubula.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> You also mention in your application form about another unknown person who died.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now you also had nothing to do with that person's death and you therefore withdraw your application in respect of that unknown person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> You became a member of the ANC and also of the Self-Defence Unit for Katlehong or Natalspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> What was your function in the Self-Defence Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> I was an operator.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now, this person, Mr Dubula, who you shot.  First of all just describe what did you do relating to his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Dubula was a police informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> You can speak Sotho, it will be translated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Dubula was a police informer and also he was a member of IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> How did you know this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Most of the times whenever he disappeared from the township, they internal stability unit police would arrive and disarm the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, now is it correct that, or explain to the learned Committee how your weapons were confiscated, and what part Dubula played in those weapons being confiscated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was wrong with being in the company of the internal stability unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> It was a big mistake if you were seen in the company of the stability unit because they used to harass the community and kill people.  Therefore, everybody who was closely associated with the police was not trusted by the community at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, and insofar as the deceased's membership of he IFP is concerned, what did you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> What did you know about the deceased Dubula's membership of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Most of the time Dubula was closely associated with the hostel dwellers, which was a stronghold of the IFP then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right.  Now, you say he was also a police informer, he used to tell the police something which caused you to lose something.  Correct?  What was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Whenever Dubula disappeared from the township the police would come and attack all the places where we kept our armoury.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> That is where you kept your weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Then while we're on that point, although you didn't mention it in your application, you did poses weapons without a licence.  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> They were not mine, they belonged to the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes, but they were in your possession.  There were weapons in your possession, during that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> They were not kept by me, but by the commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes, but you sometimes used weapons.  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And when you used them they were in your possession for the time you used them.  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> You never have had a licence to possess them.  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> So you will also seek amnesty for possession for the times when you possessed those weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now Mr Dabula, you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Yes, I did shoot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> How many times did you shoot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> I shot him once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> This was in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> It was in 1993, I cannot really recall the month and the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Can you tell was it towards the end, in the beginning or in the middle, of 93?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> It was in the middle of 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Were you alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> I was not alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Who were you with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> I was with Jabu Nkosi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Was Jabu Nkosi also a member of the Self-Defence Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Can you describe the circumstances where you found the deceased, and what you did before you killed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> The, some comrades came with Dabula and said that we have found him.  There was no firearm at that time, and me and Jabu rushed to fetch a firearm.  We came back with the firearm and some of the comrades were still holding him, Dabula. MR SHANE:   Can you give the names of these comrades, or any of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> The ones I remember are Jabu, Frank and Mandla.  The rest I do not remember because there were many of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> These ones that you've now names, were also SDU members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Yes, they were SDU members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> So in fact when he was shot he had already been captured by other members of the SDU.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> When you fired the shot at the deceased, had you know him?  Had you met him before, did you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> It was not the first time I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> When you shot him you were quite satisfied that he was an informer, and an IFP member.  You knew that.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Can you remember, you say you fired one shot, Jabu Nkosi was the other person who fired.  Can you remember how many shots Jabu fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> The first person who shot him was Jabu.  He shot him once, and he handed me the same AK-47 and I used it to shoot him once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Do you know where you hit him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> In the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Did you aim for the head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> I just fired aimlessly, because I was not well trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Did the deceased die there and then on the spot, or can you, do you know what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> He died on the spot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> What did you do afterwards, after you shot him?  What did you do?  First of all what did you do with your weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> We took them, we took the weapon back to the commander and we went different ways because the police were already roaming the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now when you took the weapon to your commander, did you give him a report that you'd killed the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> That is so, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Can you remember what the commander's reaction was when you told him you'd killed the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> He said that we did well if that was exactly what we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right.  Now who was the commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> It's Mr Msetla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, that's evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SHANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> No questions thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Now, Dubula, did he live in your section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And did he associate with the SDU comrades, the members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Yes, he knew them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And how would he have come to know the spots where you hid your weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> When these weapons are stored they are stored by a group of all the people who patrol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Are you saying Dubula used to patrol with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Dubula was quite an unpredictable person.  He was staying in our residential area but it was not his actual home.  He was just a person who was happened to be staying there.  And whenever he was present we used to be surprised as to where does he actually belong.  He would pretend to be participating in all the activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But did he patrol with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Sometimes he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Now, I'm not too clear as to exactly where it is that you killed him.  Your evidence is he was brought to you.  Where were you?  And where did you take him to when you killed him?  Help me with those aspects.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> We were at the Digula section and comrades brought him at Digula section and they told us that there is the Digula you've been long looking for.  Where is the firearm?  We went to consult our commander, and he gave us the AK-47.  The comrades were still keeping him at that time.  He was shot there at Digula section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Where was this?  Was this at a house, in the veld, where exactly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> It was in the veld.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you very much.  Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Booi you said he sometimes pretended as if he was patrolling with you.  And at the same time you said he was in close contact with hostel dwellers.  My question is, was he really an IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Yes, he was an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> How do you know that he was an IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> He's got friends residing in the hostels and also at that time no-one who was not a member of IFP would be able to enter the hostels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was he frequenting the hostels?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson that's the only questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, you're excused.</p>
