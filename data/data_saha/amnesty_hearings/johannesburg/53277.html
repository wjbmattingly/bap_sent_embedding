<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> Adv Motepe from the Pretoria Bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Thabile Thabete, Evidence Leader, TRC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Motepe, I understand that you're appearing for the first two applicants today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They are different matters though.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So which one are you going to deal with first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> The matter of Zakhele Simelane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will complete the evidence in that case and then move on to the other one.  Is that what you plan to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> I'm in the Committee's hands, but I thought we would finish with this one and then go to the next.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Good, we'll do it that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> As it pleases the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> Just bear with me, the applicant is having problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> Committee Members, as already discussed in the chambers, what we intend doing is to hand in the affidavit that has already been prepared, the supplementary affidavit.  I don't know at this stage if the Committee would like me to read it into the record.  As I have already indicated, the application by the applicant is detailed, it gives all the necessary information that we require.  The supplementary affidavit was just to add where, especially on the question of instructions by commanders.  I don't know if the Committee would like me to read any of this into the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you carry on, Mr Simelane, which language would you prefer to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ZAKHELE SIMELANE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may be seated.  Yes Mr Motepe, you were saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> I was saying that I don't know at this stage whether the Committee would like me to read the supplementary affidavit into the record or is it not necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, we can all read, so you don't need to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> Okay.  We do not have anything to add on the information that we have, that the Committee has before it.  As I've already indicated, the application is detailed, all the information is in there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Simelane, have you heard what your advocate has said to us about your testimony?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Yes, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you aware of the contents firstly, of your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And do you confirm the contents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you aware of the contents of the affidavit that supplements that application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you confirm the contents of that affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got any other questions that you wish to raise with the witness, Mr Motepe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> No, there's no question on my side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR MOTEPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETE:</span> I do have questions, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>	Mr Simelane, you have given evidence that, or your evidence says that you were an SDU member, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Under which area were you operating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Zone 5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Where?  Whereabouts in Zone 5?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Katlehong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> And can you briefly explain the structure of your SDU in Katlehong, from the commander right down to the last, how many members you were, who was your commander, how you used to operate. - just briefly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Let me start off with the first one.  As I was a member of the SDU we were divided into cells and sometimes there would be 10 to 15 people within a cell and each cell had a commander and there was an area commander as well as a central commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Before committing the operation that you've applied for amnesty for, what other activities did you used to do as SDUs in Katlehong, or what other activities were you involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> I would say that I was patrolling at night, patrolling with other members of the SDU's.  Those are the activities in which I was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Coming to the first robbery you spoke about, where you highjacked a car to go and fetch material, what was going to be done with the material?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> The material was to be used.  I would say there were firearms involved as part of the material and these were to be used in protecting ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Do you have information as to who supplied that material that you were going to fetch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> I would not be in the position to say because we would be given an address to say we should go to Secunda at a particular address to fetch the material.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> And who gave you that address?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Manyala, our central commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> And what position did he hold in the ANC or what authority  did he have besides being a commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> I would not know, I just knew that he is the one who was liaising with the ANC as a central commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> So are you saying you don't know whether was a member of any ANC or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> I can say he was a member of the ANC, because all the approvals came from the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Can you explain what you were going to do with the self-made weapons that were going to be made from this material?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Would you please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Can you explain how you were going to use the weapons, or rather what the weapons that you were going to make were going to be used for?  Remember you said you were going to fetch material to be used to make home-made weapons, so my question to you is what were those weapons going to be used for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Let me start off by saying that the situation at Katlehong was terrible, we were under attack most of the time, we were not in the position to protect ourselves under Inkatha's attack.  They were being assisted by the Security Forces.  We wanted to have our own weapons and we had to make our own home-made guns with which we would be in the position to protect ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Sorry, I don't know whether I missed - who used to attack you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> On page 17 of the bundle, in your statement you say you were fetched and taken to the centre point at Khumalo where you met with other comrades.  Who fetched you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> On which date may I ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> 6th of December '91.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Not 16?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Sorry, 16th, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> It was a Tuesday(?) and we had gone to a rally and on coming back I went out to see my girlfriend and on coming back from my girlfriend I received a message to the effect that comrades had come to say I was being sought at the centre point and I had to avail myself there at 7 o'clock, which I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> So you were not - were you fetch by someone to the centre point, or you went there</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> As I have indicated, people came to pick me up to say we should go to centre point.  I was not there at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Still on the first operation, when you committed the first operation of stealing the vehicle, how many were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> ...(no English interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> How many were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> There were four of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Besides Mlungisele Lindabane(?) that you've mentioned, who are the other two that you were with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Comrade Vincent as well as comrade Mpigelele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Where are they right now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> I would not say.  What I heard is that one of them has since passed away at Dekule, following the 1993 violence and I don't know where the other one is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> In your own words, how do you, how would you say - the armed robberies that you committed, how would you say they were political?  In what way were they political?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> I did explain briefly in my application that we were attacked most of the time at Katlehong so that the youth were no longer going to school, the adults were not going to work as well and there was no money with which we could buy firearms.  So an order was issued to the fact that for us to be able to protect ourselves we should go and procure help to try and protect ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Why couldn't you use your own cars, why did you need to rob other people's cars to go and fetch that material?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> We had been instructed to the effect that we should not, on fetching such materials we should use vehicles belonging to anyone of the SDU members, so avoid being arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> In your supplementary affidavit on page 2 you talk about a gun that was confiscated by the police, where did you get this gun from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> I did not have a firearm on this day, I had a toy gun.  But yes, we used to get our firearms from our commanders.  For example when we were patrolling in the evenings we would go and sign for the issuing or the reception of such firearms and we would take them back in the morning.  We used to use these firearms as well as ammunition for which we had to append our signatures.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> If you were not caught, what were you going to do with the car after you had collected the material?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> We would put the car at a place where it could be easily located by its owner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> When your commander told you to go and rob the cars, did he explain to whether it was the policy of the ANC to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> He did not explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> He did indicate that, or should I say it is not the policy of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> And with regard to the bank robberies, did he explain whether it was the policy of the ANC to robe banks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> That too was not the policy of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> So what justification can you give for having proceeded to commit these acts even though they were not policies of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> I would say that we robbed banks not following the ANC policies, but we knew that we were being attacked most of the time and we were trying that the commanders should confer with the ANC so that we can get assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>	At the time the ANC military wing had been banned or disbanded so that that structure could not be used and therefore the SDUs had to be set up so that the community could protect itself.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>	There were policies within the SDUs themselves and members knew that certain policies were broken under certain circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> With regard to the second robbery on the 7th of February 1992, is it correct that you actually did rob the bank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Which bank was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Volkskas Bank in Heidelberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> How did you rob it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> We were travelling in a vehicle.  I got off the vehicle, there were two of us in the vehicle, Boy Ndamane went to park the car at the door of the bank.  He went in first and I came in from behind and we took some money from the employees of the bank.  We out, got into the car and fled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Were there any people injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> According to what I heard in Court, one employee apparently went to see a doctor, apparently he or she was disturbed mentally, but no-one was hurt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> So they weren't any shootings that occurred during this robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> And when there was a chase between you and the policemen, were there any shootings that occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETE</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Motepe, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> I don't have any questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR MOTEPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Where is comrade Manyala today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> I was told that he passed away in the past few years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And comrade Dondolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> He too I heard is deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Simelane, are those leg irons you have on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> May the question please be repeated.  Yes, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will the prison authorities please remove that. Proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You say that you wanted to get his material to make home-made guns or weapons, do you know where these home-made weapons were going to be manufactured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Where were they going to be manufactured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> At our centre point, our meeting place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And who was responsible for manufacturing the home-made weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Katiwe was experienced, Katiwe and Khosikona Majola were the ones who were charged with the manufacturing of these.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Were they charged and convicted, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> No, they were not arrested because our operation was not accomplished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I thought you said they were charge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Chairperson, a point of rectification, they were charged with the responsibility of manufacturing the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Okay, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> For which offences are you seeking amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> All the offences that I committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, we aren't able to give you blanket amnesty, you've got to specify them to us, that is why the question was asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> May I come to his assistance there?  I believe he's referring to the offences that are mentioned in here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Three robberies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Three robberies, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Is he not applying for unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> As he has already explained he didn't possess the guns actually, he only had a toy and he was only convicted for robberies, not for arms and ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Yes, what I understand is that he was convicted for robbery in respect of the first robbery, what about the second robbery?  Wasn't there a subsequent conviction on two counts of robbery?  This one robbery, is it three robberies - I'm a bit confused, that he is seeking amnesty for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> It is three robberies, two for the motor vehicles, the third one for the bank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was your sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> 19 years prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How was that made up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> May the question be repeated please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How was that made up.  How did they get to 19 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> For the first car theft offence I was given a sentence and for the second offence I was given 13 years and for this other offence I was sentenced as well and the total number of years amounted to 19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No wait, what did you get for the first robbery of the motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Six years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the second motor vehicle robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> The vehicle as well as the bank robbery were combined and I was given 13 years for both.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see, so the total came to 19.  And when did this sentence start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> On the 21st of May 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> May 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the bank robbery successful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> No, we did not succeed in robbing the bank.  We did not succeed, but we did manage to get hold of the money at the bank, but our vehicle broke down along the way and we were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the first motor vehicle that you robbed, what happened to that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> We were arrested on the scene of the crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The first robbery for which you got six years, you robbed a motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> That's the one I'm referring to, Your Honour, we did not succeed, we were arrested on the scene of the crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And having been arrested you committed a second robbery of a motor vehicle at the time you robbed the bank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> We got out of jail on bail and we pursued with our struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> The second vehicle that you used, who did you get it from, where did you get it from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> Our commanders - or should I say, on the 9th of February 1992 they took us along to point the car to us at Maluleki Section and they said this is the vehicle that we were going to use.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> How was it identified, I mean why was it chosen, that particular vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> The reason here is that we had been told that his person was an Umdlembe(?), he was not contributing and he would not come to assist during times of fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, I don't understand, what is an Umdlembe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> It's a sell-out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And then what happened to that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> We took it on a Monday, but it broke down along the way and its owner found it after we were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He can leave, he can go back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>	Is that all you have to produce by way of evidence, Mr Motepe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> In terms of evidence yes, but I just wanted to point in tying up.  I don't know if this will be the time ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll come to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabete, is there any bits of evidence you want to lead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are we done with the evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> We are done with the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Motepe, you wanted to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE IN ARGUMENT:</span> When one looks at the evidence that has been given before the Committee, one would realise that the offences were as a result of the attacks that were mounted on the communities by several forces, be it Inkatha, be it Security Forces, and one can see clearly the link between these types of offences, that the communities didn't have arms to defend themselves, they had to go and get arms somehow and robbing the bank is getting the money to buy the arms was one of the means that they used to acquire those arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If that was not the policy of the organisation on whose behalf he operated, would he be entitled to then rely on the allegation that he operated on the basis of a command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIMELANE:</span> If one looks at Section 20(3), it is enough for one to have acted on the orders of the commander of the SDU.  Even though the policy of the liberation movement was not to rob banks as it were, but they had specific orders from the SDUs, which were protecting the communities at that time.  And one must remember that there was not always a clear command between the ANC headquarters and the SDUs.  Communities were faced with urgent situations where they were being attacked.  At times they had to come up with their own means of protecting themselves, and that was the situation in this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you are saying that it could have been the policy of the SDUs to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> The policy of the SDUs at that particular time, not a long-standing policy.  And as one knows even liberation movements like the PAC have admitted that they used to rob banks and that is ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The SDUs were not established by the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> That is correct, but ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We all know they were established by the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> That is correct, I was just indicating the robbing of banks was not a different thing, it was actually done by other movements.  And if one looks at this sub-section I've just referred to, the motive of the person is of relevance here as well.  It is clear that it was a political motive, nothing else, there was no personal gain on these particular offences, it was a political motive.  If one looks at, I believe it's (3)(e)</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>"... whether the act, omission, offence was committed in the execution of an order, on behalf of, or with the approval of the organisation, institution, liberation movement ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>I believe it would fall under - SDU could be regarded as an institution, not necessarily a liberation movement.  The ANC in this particular instance will be a liberation movement, but provision is given that policies might have been of institutions, organisations, even liberation movements.  In this particular instance the policy of SDU institution.  So in my submission the applicant does qualify in terms of the Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anything more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> Save to refer again to the same section, but under (b), the context.  This was as a result of the uprisings that were being experienced and I have already addressed this point I believe.  I just wanted to tie it with this sub-section.  That is all at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabete?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> I have no argument, Mr Chair, except to say that I would have no objections if amnesty is granted and I leave it in the capable hands of the Committee to make a decision.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we're going to take some time to give a decision in this matter.</p>
