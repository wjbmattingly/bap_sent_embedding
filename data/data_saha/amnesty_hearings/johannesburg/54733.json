We had to go and set up a roadblock as General Oelofse instructed me. We drove to Mr Badenhorst's house and we would have gone directly to Mr Visser's house if I knew there was enough parking space for these vehicles but there was not enough parking space. And therefore we went to Mr Badenhorst's house. And his parents were on vacation, it was no problem to leave the vehicles there.\n\tWe, the Mercedes Benz and the Sentra was singled out and I gave instruction that the number plates be hidden with masking tape. And from there we went to Andre Visser's house. The reason for why we went there is I asked him if he did not have a drink for us because we liked to drink. And when we arrived there all of the men, I cannot say with conviction all of them but myself I had a whisky and water.\n\tAnd from there we went to Deon Martin's house and on our way there we went through the houses as we followed the road. What do they call it? We patrolled the area. We arrived at his house and on our way there I told him that we would have a roadblock. He suggested that we do a house penetration or that we attack squatter camps and I told him that was not the order. At Deon Martin's house I put it to the men that we were to set up a roadblock and what was involved there. Callie Meiring would take charge because he had knowledge of this. And I left them there so that they could discuss the matter. I made myself at home. I went to his drink cabinet and there I took out the brandy. It was just less than half a bottle. I divided it into two bottles, I added Coke. \n\tAnd when I went outside they already decided who was going to drive and I gave the two bottles to the two groups. Who in the other vehicle drank of the brandy I cannot say with conviction. I can go on hearsay. I think it was Mr Badenhorst but they can testify to that. I myself, I drank some of the brandy. Deon Martin did not drink. And along with us was Diedericks, he does not drink and Etienne Visser, he also did not drink.\n\tWe went to this roadblock and on our way there I discovered that the Sentra was getting left behind. I asked that the Mercedes stop and return and Gerhard Diedericks jumped out. After a while he came back and he told me that they had just assaulted two black men. I kept quiet, we drove a little on and we pulled off the road. And when the Sentra caught up with us it stopped and I reprimanded all the men and I asked them not to be out of line. And stick to their order, namely the roadblock that we had to set up.\n\tAnd from there we went to the roadblock. I thought the ideal place would be the Radora crossing or the Krugersdorp/Ventersdorp junction. I thought this would be a suitable place because this road came from the homelands and the main purpose would be to stop ANC and SACP Alliance people and to confiscate illegal weapons from them that we could use for our own revolution.",

The Sentra was used as the emergency vehicle so that it looked like a traffic vehicle. And we mounted the blue light onto this vehicle. Myself and Deon Martin decided to drive back in the direction of Ventersdorp and he was driving and while we were driving as the car approaches from the front it was my task to see who was the persons in the vehicle and from the light from his vehicle we could see whether it was white persons or black persons.\n\tIf we identified this target group we would turn around pass them.

We were approximately 8 to 10 kilometres away from the roadblock when we saw the lights of a vehicle approaching. And the closer we got to them we saw it was 2 vehicles and it was clear to us that they were following each other, they were together. Both vehicles were close to each other. Both vehicles had black persons inside the vehicles. We passed them, we turned around and we passed them again and in front was a Toyota Cressida and behind that was the Honda Ballade. We passed them, went over the hill, it had a slight curve in the road and the lights of the Mercedes was flicked. And they switched on the blue light at the roadblock.\n\tWe had already stopped at the roadblock when these 2 vehicles arrived. When they came over the small hill and saw the blue light I knew from where the lights could be seen, it was approximately 200 to 300 metres away, the 2 vehicles stopped. My men waited in anticipation, we could hear the doors open and close. We were warned by Deon Martin to take note whether or not people were being dropped off or whether something was being thrown out of the vehicle. \n\tAfter a short while, I cannot say exactly how long probably approximately 2 to 3 minutes, the vehicles started moving again. When they stopped at us the Honda Ballade was in front and the Toyota Cressida was behind the Honda this time. We ordered the passengers to get out. One of the drivers did not want to get out. I hit the side of his windshield with my tomphar(?).   He saw that I was very serious and he climbed out. We made them all stand in a line on a small embankment on the side of the road and then we made them sit down on that. \n\tThe men had their instructions. They knew exactly what to do. They searched the vehicles and looked for the necessary weapons and ammunition for which they had been asked. Deon Martin and I asked questions to the people sitting on the side. I was moving behind them with the tomphar(?). Deon Martin, who was the Commandant at that point posed the question and when I was not satisfied with an answer I used my tomphar to bump the person who had been asked the question or I hit him with the tomphar(?).  Once again I would like to say that these blows were not intended to kill. That was not the point. I had to determine firstly whether or not they were part of the target group. Questions were asked and they answered favourably that they were members of the ANC/SACP Alliance.",
