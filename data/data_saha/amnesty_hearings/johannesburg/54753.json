Mr Chairman these two matters will be heard together as they relate to essentially the same facts and not one, but the main incident is similar in both cases.\n\tThe effected parties in this matter, by that I mean both the victims and the persons who suffered damage to their property, have all been notified.  I, this morning received a telephone call from Mrs Labushachne who is the widow of the deceased party.  She has indicated to me that she would prefer not to attend the hearing as she still feels very emotionally upset about the fact that she has lost her husband as a result of the incidents which are going to be heard today.\n\tAnd she feels that it would simply rake up the past and serve no purpose for her to attend.  She is not formally opposing the granting or otherwise of the application.  As far as the other persons concerned, there are Police Officers who worked with the deceased.  They have also indicated to me that they do not wish to attend the hearing.  They are aware of the fact that it is to be heard, but they\ntoo feel, still feel very emotional about the issue.  \n\tThey are not happy about the fact that application has been made for amnesty, but they are not opposing the application, formally opposing the application.\n\tThe owner of the property, whose property was damaged, Mr Mayet and his son have both been notified of the hearing, the date, time and venue has been conveyed to them.  I have received communication this morning at about half past nine or quarter to ten that Mr Mayet, one of the Mayets will be attending, will be in attendance during the course of the hearing.

The testimony as in Annexures A and B as well as in the verbal testimony, as well as the principles held by the Boer Resistance Movement, as well as those in his plea to the court and that is Exhibit D and in particular paragraph 4.7 which reads \"I decided that as an \nAfrikaner it was my duty to defend my country against\ncommunism and Black domination.  I decided to use a home made explosive device and to explode it in an area which would create tremendous publicity for the Afrikaner and the Afrikaner cause.  At a later point an area was identified by myself, namely the Indian business centre in Bronkhorstspruit.  The purpose was through the damage done there, to indicate to the government that it was the aspiration of the Afrikaner to be free of Black and communist domination.\"\n\tThis was the argument of the applicant at his court case and in his application today, he stands by this claim.\n\tIn the charge against the applicant, it was also indicated that this was an act with a political motive and we want to argue with respect that at no point during his hearing, court hearing nor at any time, there is any reason to believe that this act was not committed with a political motive.",

            "Mr Chairman, with respect religion plays the key and core role amongst Afrikaners.  If you look at Exhibit C you will see in the first paragraph what role religion plays amongst the Afrikaner.\n\tThe religion of the Afrikaner, as given testimony by both Froneman and Harmse, both witnesses, would be taken away from them, it was their believe that were there to be an ANC/SACP alliance government and if the Muslim faith would then take preeminence, that then they would by oppressed and that the faith of the Afrikaner would be lost.\n\tWith respect it would appear that the faith of the Afrikaner was very strongly held and it was embodied in the previous constitution.  The churches attended in the past by the Afrikaner and the religious practice in general on every level of the Afrikaner, would have been diminished or affected and the aspirations of the Afrikaner, affected in this way.\n\tI want to argue before this Committee with respect, that in terms of Section 20(2) that the applicant does in fact meet the requirements, particularly paragraphs (a).  He was a member of the Boer Resistance Movement or BWB.  This was a widely known political Organisation.  He acted on behalf of this political Organisation and he acted in good faith in the struggle, the political struggle which he believed had existed.\n\tAnd then particularly with respect Mr Chairman, the applicant meets the requirement of paragraph (d), that this generally widely known political Organisation and that it was within the course of his duties and a very express duty in this particular case, that it was aimed particularly against a particular Organisation, in this case the then government as well as the ANC/SACP alliance.\n\tWith regard to subparagraph (3), the motive has been indicated very clearly by the witness as well as the second applicant.  The context within which the act occurred, I want to argue with respect that at that time the election was very close.  There was great uncertainty in the country and it was clear in the view of these persons that there would be a majority government in due course.\n\tThe purpose or goal of the act in particular, I want to argue with respect that the witness had indicated very\nclearly that what the purpose and reason for the act had been.\n\tParagraph (e) this was an act which was carried out with instructions, very clearly under instructions and on behalf of the BWB, or Boere Resistance Movement.  There is no doubt with regard to the membership, nor is this being argued against by Mr Black.\n\tWith regard to the link between the act as in paragraph (f), the goal to be attained and the proportionality, I want to argue with respect that the applicant took the proportionality into account in view of his goal and in his plea, Exhibit D, this was also clearly argued.\n\tUnder these circumstances, I want to argue with respect Mr Chairman, that the applicant meets all the requirements of the Act and that amnesty should be granted to him for the acts with regard to which he appeared before the Supreme court.

As it would indicate that many people disagreed with the route taken by the then government.\n\tAs stated in the documents presented by the applicant, this would create circumstances of chaos and circumstances would arise which would change the route.  This would touch the ANC by touching the Muslim community, which in view of the applicant, were supporters of the ANC.\n\tThis was also the case when the ANC acted in many cases, the intention was to generate chaos, to bring about revolution, to take over the country, to force the country in fact to that which was achieved by the ANC.\n\tAnd there were many persons, with respect, and many communities, who were attacked and who were killed or who were injured under these circumstances.  With respect, the\ngovernment of that day, did in fact change their minds because of these acts of the ANC and handed over to the ANC, had an election.  If we look for instance at the McBride case, and the Amanzimtoti bombing, as well as the Pretoria bomb, which was admittedly aimed against the Army, the Silverton incident, there was action against innocent bank staff, the Messina case where an innocent person, an ex-Minister of Kangwane was killed in cold blood, shot in cold blood, other innocent persons, as well as police who were assassinated and with respect, those acts in fact gained the goal.\n\tPersons now in key positions of the ANC are Muslim people.

            "Mr Chairman, I will not repeat what Mr Prinsloo said, I support his argument with regard to the requirements of the Act.  I want to present to you that it is my argument that Mr Froneman does in fact meet the requirements of the Act as particularly mentioned in Section 22(a) and (d).\n\tYour Honour, Mr Froneman was if I can say this with respect, he was a young boy when he committed this crime.  However, he did not waste anyone's time.  He has been in jail now for three years.\n\tImmediately after his arrest, he appeared in court and he pleaded guilty and already at that time he said to the court why he committed this act.\n\tYour Honour, there had been and you are in possession of the testimony of the criminologist.  There are some aspects which differ from that which he presented to you\ntoday in his testimony.\n\tWith respect I want to argue that at that time, he attempted to move away.  You will note that he does not mention the names of the individuals.  The idea, as he has given testimony that he does not want to be a traitor, he does not want people to consider him to be a traitor.\n\tAdv de Jager asked Mr Prinsloo why - what the role of religion is amongst the Afrikaner.  Mr Froneman in his application said that for him, there is only one God.  With the statement of F.W. de Klerk that all religions will be considered equal, this created fear amongst Afrikaner people.\n\tOne has to pay attention particularly to the Boer Resistance Movement and what they said with regard to religion.  Again Mr Froneman said that he left the AWB to join the BWB, particularly because they had a more pure position.\n\tIf you would grant me the opportunity I want to read to you the first three paragraphs of the programme of principles of the Boer Resistance Movement, and this is Exhibit C, Your Honour.\nThe foundation of the Boer Resistance Movement is, the Boer Resistance Movement acknowledges the sovereignty of the Trinity, the God of Blood River and of the vow there, who determined that the Boer people under the leadership of Hendrik Potgieter and Andries Pretorius and Paul Kruger, were led to freedom, were liberated\n\tand achieve their own free Volkstaat or ethnic state.\n\tOur guidance comes from this God only.  We will continue in our liberation struggle with the gun in the one hand and the Bible in the other.\n  This Your Honour is the foundation.  The very foundation of the Boer Resistance Movement is centred around their God.  This one God whom they worshipped.\n\tThen with regard to the purpose or goal of the movement.  \nTo bring honour to the sacrifices of our ancestors and in memory of their sacrifices, to on route to the freedom of our people, so that we can continue under their legacy in our own state under our own flag.\nWith this in mind, the Boer Resistance Movement wants to hand over the heritage of freedom to our children.\n\tAgain, Your Honour, exactly that which was testified by Mr Froneman in his childlike simplicity, he understood these matters in this way when he attended the meetings of the BWB.\n\tHere it is in black on white what the position of the Boer Resistance Movement in fact was.  \nFinally guidelines, \nthe goals of the Boer Resistance Movement is to motivate our people again, to bring our people back to an armed readiness against the onslaught on our people, to prepare our people to be ready for battle, to be battle ready for the third liberation struggle.\nYour Honour, this is exactly what occurred with Mr Froneman when he joined Boer Resistance Movement.  He has said to the Honourable Committee, that whilst still a school child, religious instruction was removed from the school curriculum.\n\tHe was told that it is necessary to fight for, to make war so that the ethnic state, the Volkstaat and the Boer people could remain free.  And that this should be done with the Bible in the one hand and the rifle in the other.  Then at meetings he is told that the ANC/SACP and the then\ngovernment is in fact the enemy.\n\tIt was also said at these meetings that Muslims have high positions in the ANC and that it is in fact the Muslim community, in particular, the Muslim community who should the ANC take over the government, that Muslims would have senior positions and this in fact occurred.\n\tIf we look at senior positions, many many of the senior positions are in fact held by Muslim Indians, except for Mr Naidoo who is a Hindu.\n\tThese fears in fact came true.  The most serious fear in fact, the most serious fear of this young man was that he would lose his country and his religion.\n\tHe then carried out the goals of this movement as it was communicated to him.   I want to hold to Your Honours that Mr Froneman does in fact meet the requirements, he act under the instructions of Mr Harmse.\n\tMr Harmse acted under the instructions of the Movement and I want to present to Your Honours that he has made totally clear what it was and there is no reason why he should not be granted amnesty for the act. ...

            "A great deal of evidence has been placed before the Committee, relating to the political education, indoctrination and motivation of the applicants.\n\tThe aims and objectives of the AWB and the BWB.  Excepting which, should the Commission accept that the act for which the applicants seek amnesty were in deed motivated by reason of this indoctrination, and with a view to obtaining a political, or making a political statement, that is as far as I can say as opposed to obtaining an objective.\n\tI respectfully submit that when one coldly analyses some details relating to the actions taken, the actions are in my submission grossly out of proportion to the objective sought by the applicants.\n\tI say that for a number of reasons.  Mr Harmse was not acting under orders as such to commit or to target a particular community.  He was given carte blanche to use his discretion how to achieve the broad aims and objectives of his Organisation.\n\tHe appointed a young man of some 17 years to reconnoitre the area and with his, Harmse's, approval, a target in a fairly isolated part of South Africa, I say that with all due respect with Bronkhorstspruit, was selected.\n\tThey had in fact considered targets in Pretoria.  Now at no stage did either Mr Harmse or Mr Froneman indicate that they even considered placing a bomb in a government building or government institution which would not be occupied by people at the time of the detonation.\n\tWe are told that after war had allegedly been declared by their Organisation, the enemy was government.  The enemy was the ANC/SACP alliance.  The enemy was at one stage the large, it included large financial corporations.\n\tThe names of the likes of Anglo American were mentioned.  Now, my submission as to why the acts are out of all proportion to this objective are first of all the nature of the target which was selected, a easily accessible commercial centre which was to be frequented by ordinary civilians.\n\tIt was submitted by Mr Prinsloo for Mr Harmse that the bomb was placed there at about 4 am in the morning, but Mr Harmse in his evidence, when asked as to when he thought or\nwhen he expected the bomb to explode, he said when the shops were opened.\n\tObviously targeting at life, not simply to allow a bomb to explode in a uninhabited shopping complex and thereby make a statement and gain the publicity, but he clearly foresaw that people would be killed.\n\tMr Froneman on the other hand says that he thought property would simply be damaged.  Mr Harmse on the other hand said that as his Commanding Officer, he was satisfied that Froneman was aware of the fact that people would be killed.\n\tSo first of all it is the place and the target selected, then if one has a look and studies the nature of the device used, as a Committee member, Mr de Jager quite correctly points out, it was tantamount to laying a landmine.  \n\tThat nature, the device was an uncontrolled explosive, it could kill anybody indiscriminately, it could be set off by a heavy truck or the vibrations of a truck just driving by.  So it was an indiscriminate killer similar to landmines.\n\tI submit that that is another fact that contributes to the proportionality and considering the act.  Why I say that is if it was a controlled device, deliberately set to go off at a time when no civilians would be about, it may put a different light on the issue.",
