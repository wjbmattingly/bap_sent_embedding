The purpose of this action was to actagainst the ANC and other liberation movements with a revolutionaryonslaught against the apartheid government to destabilise andpersuade them.   The motive of the act was to counter terrorismand to protect the country.   A further motive was to eliminatethe activists so that further actions against the State and thepublic could not be perpetrated.   The context against which thishappened was against the background of an emergency situationin the country, as well as the continuing violence, intimidationsand unrest.   The liberation movements attempted to make the countryungovernable at this stage as part of their political rebellion.  The legal nature of the act and the facts of the act is apparentfrom the nature and particulars of the act, as mentioned.   Thepurpose and goal was to intimidate or eliminate an ANC activist,supporter or terrorist.   The action against Thibedi was carriedout under the instructions as mentioned above.   The purpose wasnecessary to eliminate an ANC terrorist, activist or supporterwhich was necessary in view of the struggle, and the securitysituation in the country.

Mr Chairman in respect of the court order, I've read in thenewspapers about the court order, I don't exactly know in whatway the court order binds this Committee.   What I would wantto say in respect of the 14 day period, I'm informed by my learnedfriend Mr Curran that that was applicable, or that is applicableto witnesses apparently who have to appear in front of the HumanRights Violation's Committee.   Mr Chairman if I read Section30 correctly, and especially Section 30(2), it makes provisionspecifically for this Committee to request a person to give evidenceat the hearing of the Commission.   If one reads Section 30(2)carefully, it says\n  \"If during any investigations by or any hearing beforethe Commission, that means during any hearing before the Commission,any person is implicated in a manner which may be to his or herdetriment the Commission shall, if such person is available, affordhim or her an opportunity to submit representations...\"\nand then in the last sentence:\n  \"...or to give evidence at a hearing of the Commission.\"\nNow that clearly must be the same hearing referred to in the firstsentence of sub-section (2).   I read this Section as meaningthat the procedure that the Committee has followed under thesecircumstances, is the correct procedure.   There is not time periodand obviously one then has to apply the\n2b normal /...\nMR DU PLESSIS 276 ADDRESS\nnormal rules of natural justice, which means that a reasonabletime period afforded to a person would be proper.  The indicationis that both these witnesses have had knowledge of the fact thatthey are required to appear on Thursday and it is our view thatunder the circumstances, where we are not dealing with a criminaltrial or a civil trial and where we're simply dealing with somebodywho has to come and tell the truth, and where we are also dealingwith a situation that these witnesses will only be required togive evidence at these hearings in respect of the applicationof Col Venter, so their evidence will be very limited.   It willbe relevant pertaining to Col Venter's application.   \n On that basis we fail to see where any prejudice lies in respectof these witnesses, perhaps the only prejudice might be that theyhaven't seen the specific application and the written part thereof.\nMR MPSHE(?):: I'm not even sure they need to see the applicationbeforehand.",

I must putit on record that the event took place on 22 October in 1987.  It happened at about 2 o'clock in the morning.   Prior to thatincident on 7 October of the same year, in 1987, there were peoplewho came to my place driving in a cream white E20, as I was informedby my wife who were looking for me at the time.

            "On the 19th, that's when I returned home fromthe 7th.   When I slept at home on the 19th, nothing happened. When I woke up on the 20th I just thought, I told myself thatI must just as well continue to sleep in my house.  Little didI realise that two days thereafter, a bomb was going to be throwninto my house.   I must say that after that happened I was bothangry and relieved, because at least I knew they were lookingfor me, they couldn't get me, the attempted on my life and theyfailed.   That was the part that made me relieved, but the partthat they wanted to kill me with my entire family, and I havelost all my belongings, made me very angry.   The propaganda theyused, you must realise that that explosion was so powerful that10 houses in my surroundings were damaged and that created problemsbecause some members of the, of my, some members in my neighbourhoodwere convinced by the police propaganda, were convinced by thepolice propaganda that I had that bomb in my house and that that...bythe police propaganda thereafter that that bomb, I had it in myhouse, it exploded prematurely.   It took me some time to convincemembers within my community that this was actually done by noneother than the police because members of my community at the timeknew that I was arrested several times and apparently my onlyenemy at the time, I would assume, was the security\n3 police /...\nMR MPSHE 285 G D TIBEDI\npolice.   I just want to clarify the point that the house whereI was sleeping, was my hideout.   That is not true.   That ismy house.   On the day of the incident I was sleeping in thathouse with my wife, my daughter and my sister.   My daughter wasseven at the time, seven years at that time.   She is 16 yearsnow.   My sister was 19, she was actually preparing for her Std10 examinations.   The trauma my family underwent after that incidentis very difficult to relate to this House.   My wife, my sisterhad continuous nightmares.   We had to consult with clinical psychologiststo try and help, and what hurt me most was that I did not knowwho did it.   I was hoping that I was going to testify last weekTuesday, it was going to be a coincidence because that was goingto be on the day of the 9th anniversary of that incident.  \nMR MPSHE (contd)",

            "You see that is a very difficult question toanswer, more especially if you find yourself in my situation whereyou only realise now who did this kind of thing.   You see itmust also be dealt with at two levels, I must deal with it attwo levels.   The first level will be at a family level, I'llhave to deal with it at a family level first and try to seek consensuswithin my family members as to what their feelings will be.  Yes, they claim I was a target, but in their action they knewthey were not only targeting at me, they knew they were killingme and my entire family.  That's why I'm saying I still have toconsult at that level.  The second level will be at an organisationallevel, I am a member of the Provincial Executive Committee ofthe ANC and surely at that level I've got to share some of theseexperiences with my colleagues.   Having said that I am awareof the position of the ANC inasfar as the whole question of Nationalreconciliation is concerned and I am fully in support of whatthe ANC says about National reconciliation.   I also agree thatreconciliation cannot be given until there is full disclosure,we can only be given amnesty once we have disclosed everythingand they we will be able to achieve, to achieve reconciliation.  In my own mind, in my own mind I don't think the process ofamnesty, as we are sitting today, will work until we get a fullcommitment from the perpetrators.   You see, to say I'm sorryI won't do it again is not enough.   We are sitting with a problemwhere the victims are the ones who seem to be expected to sayI am sorry all the time.   I'm saying here\n3 that /...\nMR MPSHE 291 G D TIBEDI\nthat it's high time that the perpetrators also, not only in wordsbut in deeds, they must be able to go all out and convince theircommunities that yes, we acted in this way and we acted wrongly.  It's not enough to say to me I am sorry Tibedi, but to me Ithink the process will be assisted a great deal if they can goout and say to their own communities whom they were trying toprotect, as they are claiming, they must go and say to them wedid it in the name of apartheid, we are sorry we apologise andwe want you to follow us in this example.   Then the process,the process will then be easy, the process of reconciliation willthen  be easy, but that's my view.   So I'm sorry I don't havea yes or no answer to your question.",

From where he would havearrived I cannot remember, I cannot remember whether this waslocal or international travel but we made preparations to eliminatehim at the airport in Durban.   The arms were already preparedat that time because of the information received.   With a Kombiwhich I can no longer remember the model or colour, I can rememberthat there were curtains in front of the windows, we screenedthe inside of the Kombi with curtains and there was also a curtainin between the seat of the driver and the back of the vehicle.   Very early that morning we departed at a time I can no longerremember and I can no longer remember what time Father Makatshwawas supposed to arrive, we had his flight number and the timeof arrival.   We arrived in Durban, I can remember that we arrived...(endof side 2)...clear view of the main exit of the Durban airport.  At a certain point, Father Makatshwa who was very well knownto us, we saw him leaving the exit but he was, there were oneor two people in between us and him all the time, there was someor other woman and possibly two men, one or two men but I couldbe mistaken.   There was a woman in front of him all the time.  As they came closer to the\n4. Kombi /...\nMR DU PLESSIS 307 J HECHTER\n   Kombi we were parked in such a way that we had a clear viewwith which to shoot.   It was very dark inside the vehicle andas Father Makatshwa walked closer and became ever clearer, thiswoman was in between him and us all the time which meant thatwe could not fire on him.   Mr Van Vuuren who grew up on a farmwould have been the shot.   Subsequently when he had passed us,we decided that we would follow him to see if we could not eliminatehim along the road with an AK-47 rifle.  What happened however,was that he entered a particular vehicle, I cannot remember atall what kind of vehicle, what colour of vehicle or how many peoplewere in the vehicle, but I can remember that when you leave theairport, (apologies), you had a toll-road through which you hadto exit and where you had to pay.   The vehicle in which FatherMakatshwa was driving left through the toll-road and then a personbetween us and him had some trouble to find the ticket with whichto pay at the toll-gate and then Father Makatshwa drove off.  By the time we had paid to leave the toll-road, we could no longersee his vehicle, or it was no longer available.   We drove overa bridge and if I remember correctly, the bridge had a road goingtowards the South Coast, one to the North Coast and one to theblack township and we did not know in which direction Father Makatshwahad driven, so we decided that that would be the end of the matter.  We then took the North Coast road towards Durban and then\n4. we /...\nMR DU PLESSIS 308 J HECHTER\n   we turned home.",

I then told him that I did not think that I would want to continuein this kind of operation and that I don't want to be part ofthis game any longer.   There was a big explosion in the office.  The Brigadier was very angry to such an extent that he transferredme from this Unit to a unit known as the, this was a unit in whichwe had to decide which people were appropriate for the SecurityBranch and I, and Paul was made into a driver who had to lookafter General Smit and he had to look after his garden, work inhis garden whenever there was work necessary.

            "Very briefly Chairperson, I'm not going to commenton the two incidents that the applicants referred to for the simplereason that I heard this information practically for the firsttime today when I read the affidavits, so there is\n4b very /...\nMR MPSHE 327 S MKHATSHWA\nvery little for me to say about that because I really didn't know.  All that I can say at this stage is that my Gods, my ancestorsare very powerful indeed and also thanks to the community becauseI would imagine that by and large I am still in one piece todaybecause of the support that I received from the community.   Ithink Captain Hechter has made reference to that, indirectly atleast.   What I would like to say very briefly, I would like torefer to the evidence that was given here referring to me as someonewho supported terrorism and communism and all the other \"isms\"that you can think of, which the apartheid regime totally hatedand was totally opposed to.   I just want to put the record straightand point out that I certainly was never a terrorist, whateverthat meant, neither did I keep terrorist literature in my house,in my library.  The fact that I did read literature that madereference also to say to Marxism and so forth that does not inany way make one a communist or even a Marxist for that matter.  I believe that in my profession, in my vocation as a priest,if I have to make effective ministry to the people of God, I needto be fully informed about the lives of my people, the sufferingsof my people and other nations that found themselves in a similarsituation.   That I also needed to be informed about economicand political issues generally and that is the reason why I hadto read as broadly as possible otherwise it becomes very difficultto minister, meaningfully, to the people of God.   Let me alsojust say very briefly that when I came in here the first time,which I think was the Thursday or Friday when the hearings waspostponed, when I moved into the hall and saw the five gentlemenfor the first time and when Captain Hechter stood up and stretchedout his\n4b hand /...\nMR MPSHE 328 S MKHATSHWA\nhand I had ambivalent feelings.   The first feeling was one ofuncertainty, of hesitation but also of deep scepticism, for thesimple reason that the last time I think when Captain Hechterand I met he had a gun in his hand pointed at my forehead.   Doorswere broken down, that's how he, Capt Loots and others gainedentry, but that's not an issue for me now, but I'm just sayingthat that was my first response when he stretched out his hand.  In the same time, because of my deep-felt belief as a Christian,but because also of the policy of the Government of National Unity,the main emphasis on reconciliation and building a new nation,my second sentiments immediately said to me stretch out your handand meet Captain Hechter.   I shook hands with all the other gentlemenand for me it was a very strange feeling.   Also when I, I hopethis is not relevant Chairperson I'm just trying to put the thingin context, but also when I saw Brigadier Cronje I also rememberedbecause they made reference to the church having been membersof their church and so forth, I remember an incident when he andhis troops of 25, 30 of them stormed into my house, early as usual12:30 or 1 o'clock in the morning, forced me to, at least frog-marchedme into my church with their hats on, smoking, and I said veryclearly I remember I said to Brigadier Cronje you may not haverespect for me as an individual, that's your democratic right,but as a Christian you ought to respect the house of God.   Beforethey left the church, they forced me to open the tabernacle whichthey threatened to blow up.   Those of you who are Catholics youknow what a tabernacle is, and how we regard that.   Finally asa compromise I opened it myself and they looked inside and theydidn't find what they thought they would find.   There\n4b again /...\nMR MPSHE 329 S MKHATSHWA\nagain I shook his hand, I took his hand and I said as long asthe five gentlemen are now prepared to help all of us to builda new country, to take the issue of social justice very seriously,no longer just as rhetoric but as something that all of us haveto work for based on the spirit and policy of reconciliation,I say I'm prepared to take his hand and not to doubt his bonafides.   So these are just a few comments I wanted to makeChairperson so that in other words I'm saying that I'm not goingto refer to other incidents that happened which probably thesegentlemen may not have been informed or maybe not have been awareof because then I would be in a much better position actuallyreally to testify to something that I personally experienced,even though I was blindfolded and all the rest of it, somethingI could say something much more concrete about that.   We arejust dealing here with the situation of incidents that I was notaware of but only just say a few words in very broad terms aboutthe situation that existed and my attitude.   Thank you.",

This was to be in accordancewith section 29(1)(c) of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, No 14 of 1995.\n A criminal trial is pending in our Supreme Court against fourof the applicants and the abovementioned persons are known tobe State witnesses in that trial. \n The Committee was also requested to call upon the Attorney-Generalof the Transvaal in  terms of  section 29(1)(b) of the Act, tohand over the dockets  of the inquiries made by the  Attorney-Generalin respect of the applicants and the criminal trial. \n It is convenient to deal with the latter request first.  It was submitted that the Attorney-General's docket contained certainstatements by State witnesses and  that these  would be of a materialimportance to the applicants in the application and it would assistthe Committee in obtaining the whole truth. \n Section 29(1)(b) gives the Committee a discretion which it mayexercise if, in its opinion, the contents of the Attorney-General'sdocket  are  relevant to the subject matter of this hearing. On the information placed before us we cannot say that the contentsof the dockets contain\n1A material/...\n336 RULING\nmaterial relevant to the subject matter of the  present hearing. In fact, no information whatsoever was advanced as  to what they may contain apart from information relating to the pending prosecutionagainst the applicants.\n Because of this  it  is  not  possible for the Committee to forman opinion that its contents, namely the contents of the docketare relevant for the present hearing.\nThis application can  therefore not succeed. \n In respect of the first application, the one to subpoena Statewitnesses, it was submitted that  it  is  reasonable, necessaryand justifiable in an open and democratic society based upon freedomand equality that  witnesses who could provide material informationand corroboration of the truth of the applicants' applications,should not be prohibited to give evidence.  The Truth Commission forms part of the democratic South  Africa. \n The Committee was requested to exercise its discretion  in termsof section 31(2) of the Act, which deals, inter alia, withthe compellability of witnesses.  It was  argued by counsel  forthe applicants that even State witnesses, namely the witnessesin the pending criminal trial, might be called to appear at thishearing and be compelled to answer questions provided that  there has been consultation with the Attorney-General as required bysection 32(2)(a) and that the Committee has satisfied  itselfthat to require such information from State witnesses is reasonable,necessary and justifiable in  an open and democratic society basedon freedom and equality as provided in section 32(2)(b).\n It is argued that there is no provision in the Act which excludesState witnesses from the ambit of this Act,\n1A Mr/...\n337 RULING\nMr Du Plessis said, that his clients were committed totell the truth at this hearing and that if the State witnessesare ordered to give evidence at this hearing their evidence, ifthey are truthful, will corroborate the applicants' case for thegrant of amnesty. \n The  Attorney-General's representative strenuously opposed theapplication on the obvious ground that the State  case againstthe applicants in the pending trial might be considerably impairedand compromised if State witnesses are  compelled to answer questionsat this hearing.  Their answers will afford applicants advanceknowledge of the evidence which they will face at their trial.\n In the light of the  attitude of the  Attorney-General, therehas to be other compelling reasons before an order can be  made. As things stand at present, no information is placed before usto indicate the nature of the evidence which the applicants hopeto obtain from the State witnesses.  All we have is a vague expressionof belief that the evidence of the State witnesses will offersome corroboration to the applicants in their evidence in thishearing.  \n The Committee does not feel persuaded by the argument advancedon behalf of the applicants.  The application to subpoena theState witnesses is therefore refused. \n1A",

We realise that his testimony was on behalfof all the applicants, which means that if any applicant wereto testify in regard to any of the incidents, and if one wereto start now with the Makope, Maake and Sefola killings, we wouldbe entitled to cross-examine those particular applicants regardingthat general evidence as well, but they didn't give the testimony,so we believe it would be right and correct to rather cross-examinethe person who gave that testimony.  So that is really the reasonwhy we would like to cross-examine him on that before we proceedon cross-examination on specific incidents.",

There  willbe enough time to put all that you wish to put to Brig Cronjeon the general evidence and on anything that you have that isspecific which will emerge no doubt from the evidence given bywitnesses to test whether what he has said under his general evidence is correct or not.

Where evidence concerninggeneral behaviour of all the applicants is concerned, I thinkit would be prudent if  you did leave that to Brig Cronje simplybecause when the  proceedings started it was on the basis thatin order to save a great deal of time Brig Cronje would be allowedto give evidence on the general background.

            "(BEGINNING OF RECORDING ON TAPE 4 SIDE B -NO RECORDING ON TAPE 4 SIDE A)  Thank you Chair.  Having consultedwith my seniors, the attitude would be the same, namely, and Iwant to place it on record.   As you will remember, on Mondaywhen the application was made to subpoena the witnesses, thesewere particularly 204 witnesses under the State Witness ProtectionProgramme.  These 204 witnesses are co-deeders of the applicants. As you will also remember, the position of the State from thebeginning would have been that there would have been an objectionand that there would have been the request not to subpoena thesetestimonies, since these would be key witnesses in the State'scase.  If amnesty is denied and it is possible to prosecute, thenthey would be the key witnesses.  It was the position of the Attorney-Generalthat should this Committee decide to subpoena these witnessesand if they were to give testimony, the Attorney-General wouldrest in that decision.\n The difference, however, is that Mr Currin's witnesses are simplymembers of the family, they are relatives of the victims.  Theseare not persons who were present on the scene of any of the deeds. These are simply persons who will say that we had children orhusbands who went missing at a certain stage until during thecourse of this year has the State obtained statements, it becamepossible to determine where these family members might be.  Thereason why Mr Currin is calling these witnesses is not to givealternative testimony since they were not present at the events,but to consider some of the reparations that might be made tothese persons if it is determined at a later\n4B stage/...\n414\nstage that they were in fact victims.   In that case the Attorney-General'sposition would be that there is a fundamental difference betweenthe 204 witnesses whom the applicants intended to subpoena andthese witnesses who simply will bring testimony that they lostthese family members through some or other act. \n This, then, is the position of the Attorney-General in this particularcase.  I don't know if you wanted to ask me any additional questionsin this regard.",

            "I asked Charl Naude for what purposes he neededthe memorandum and he answered that Special Forces had targetedRibiero or had identified him as a possible target.  I told himthat if they had identified him as a target, they surely had tohave information of their own and why did they need a memorandumfrom me?   He replied that they only\n2. wanted /...\nMR DU PLESSIS 463 J H CRONJE\nwanted to verify the information to ascertain whether we had thesame information as what they had so that he could hand in thereport or present a report to General Joubert, his CommandingOfficer.   The moment he mentioned the word \"target\"I realised that this was a terrorist(?) operation.  I indicatedthat I would make available the applicable file but that theywould have to draft the memorandum themselves.  I must mentionthat there was no mention of Mrs Ribiero.   I then instructedCaptain Hechter to keep an eye on a member of Charl Naude's staffwho drafted the memorandum personally.    Hechter informed meat a later stage that the Special Services requested him particularyCharl Naude, or Charl Naude personally and one of his staff persons,A Robin, to assist them in their planning with regard to the eliminationof Dr Ribiero.   Hechter kept me up to date with regard to theirplans.\n I was therefore aware of the operation since it was a, or sinceI suspected that it was a terrorist operation I did not interferewith the preparations any further.   Subsequent to the event,after the act had been committed, I heard from Captain Hechterthat two black Angolan men who had been flown in by Special Forcesfrom somewhere in the then South West Africa, that these two Angolanmen had shot Dr Ribiero and his wife.   Subsequently I also hadbeen informed or I heard that Brigadier Basie Smit of the detectivebranch and that he had determined that Noel Robie's(?) vehicle,which I must mention was registered in Noel Robie's name althoughit was a SADF vehicle, that Noel Robie had picked up the blackAngolan men from somewhere after they had shot the Ribiero's andthat he removed them from the scene of the crime.   Basie SmitI believe had\n2. determined /...\nMR DU PLESSIS 464 J H CRONJE\ndetermined from Leyland, who manufactures the Landrover, thatthis particular vehicle was in fact sold to the SADF.  After Ihad heard this, General Joubert of Special Forces phoned me andrequested me that Captain Hechter and myself would attend a meetingat their headquarters.   At this meeting the following personswere present, General Joubert, Colonel Joe Verster, CommandantCharl Naude, Lt Col Charl Naude, and an additional person whomI am unable to identify.   General Joubert informed me that BasieSmit had determined that the Landrover did belong to the SADFand that Noel Robie was in fact in command of the vehicle andhad driven the vehicle.   He requested me to, not to assist BasisSmit's investigation and in fact to ruin it one way or anotherand I told him that I would do whatever I could in this regard.  \n The following evening I received a message at home from BrigadierSchoon that the Commissioner General, Johan Coetzee, would bevisiting me the next morning or that he wanted to see me the nextmorning.   Early the next morning before I was able to go to headoffice, Captain Hechter phoned me and informed me that GeneralJoubert had visited General Coetzee the previous evening and thatthe matter was discussed at that meeting.   Subsequently I wentto Brigadier Schoon who took me along to General Coetzee's office.  General Coetzee asked me whether I knew anything about the Ribieromatter, I told him that I did and I also told him that this wasan operation of Special Forces.    He then informed me that GeneralJoubert and General Gleeson the previous evening had visited himat home with regard to the Ribiero, or to the Ribiero's death.  He then asked me why I was co-operating with the SADF and Itold him that\n2. Brigadier /...\nMR DU PLESSIS 465 J H CRONJE\nBrigadier Schoon had given me instructions to co-operate withSpecial Forces and that Schoon had in fact claimed that GeneralCoetzee had given him this instruction and Brigadier Schoon didnot deny that he had done so.   General Coetzee then took theinvestigation away from Basie Smit and gave it to Brigadier VanWyk, he tasked Brigadier Van Wyk with the investigation.   Asfar as I can remember there was a later provisional investigationin which Noel Robie did appear.   Noel Robie was then, it wasthen said that he was not guilty in any way, or blameworthy inany way.",

First, in answer to my learnedfriend Mr Mpshe's argument that he only gave notice to let peopleknow who are implicated in the actual commission of the deed orthis specific deed itself, that that argument does not pertainto the Metasi matter because in the Metasi matter it was decidedthis morning that that matter cannot go on because other peopleare implicated should have notice and should be witnesses.   Itseems to me there is not consistency in the application of whoshould be called as witnesses, who should be notified as partieswho have an interest in the matter.   We, and I want to placethis on record, before the hearings were scheduled to start on21 October, before that we gave an indication that we are workinghard to finalise the applications, we were requested to hand inthe applications as soon as possible so as to enable the Commissionto notify all relevant persons.   We\n2. did /...\nMR DU PLESSIS 470 ADDRESS\ndid so.   We handed in the applications the Monday before the21st, that was a week before.   We were given an indication bythe Commission, as I understood it and my attorney as well, thatthere was enough time that they would be able to reach personsand those persons they won't reach could be reached during thefirst week of the hearings and one could then proceed with thosematters that people were notified.   We are now two and a halfweeks away from the point where we handed in the applications.  As far as I understand, the Commission has an investigativeunit whose task it is to notify people implicated in the hearingsand who have an interest in applications.   We, as well as thepublic and I want to include yourselves as well, expect from thepeople who are responsible for this to do that.   I am not pointinga finger to my learned friend because that's not his job, he'sthe chief presenter of evidence.   What we say is if applicationshave to be postponed every time because these requirements havenot been met in respect of which we have no obligation, in respectof which we cannot do anything about, we are prejudiced.   Weare prepared, there are various issues involved here, there arequestions of legal costs involved here which everybody knows isa difficult aspect and I just want to place on record that ifmatters have to be postponed because people have not been notified,as they should have done, the applicants are prejudiced by that.\n What I want to say, however, is that we are fully prepared andI reiterate what I said this morning.  We are fully prepared toaccommodate everybody concerned in these hearings.

I am not conceding in saying that, that that is a requirementthat has to be satisfied before amnesty can be granted, I willhave another argument on that when I address the Committee onthe requirements for amnesty.   As I read the Act, compliancewith this specific part of the Act is not an obligation that restson the applicants and because it doesn't rest on the applicantsthat is not a requirement the applicants have to satisfy for amnesty.  What we don't want is we don't want procedural difficultieswhich can cause difficulties later.   \n Our view is we will be prejudiced but we also say if people haven'tbeen notified there could be problems with the hearing continuingon that specific incident and we are quite prepared to go on withany other incident we can under the circumstances to utilise thetime.   I want to make the point that Brigadier Cronje is therenow, there was an indication by Mr Currin that he wanted to cross-examineBrigadier Cronje...(end of side 1)...",

In theface of the escalating violence of the enemy, the revolutionaryviolence of the people becomes very, very important and we knowthat the revolutionary violence of the oppressed people of ourcountry is epitomised by MK is the revolutionary violent arm ofour people.   The designation of the year as the year of MK isa clarion call to the people's army, MK, to escalate the armedstruggle.   Now you are asking what have we achieved in the militaryfield, I believe in all modesty that MK has become a permanentfeature of the struggle of our national liberation and socialemancipation, we have enriched the struggles of our people byintroducing the armed element.   The enemy statement itself hasadmitted openly that 1986 has seen an unprecedented escalationof armed struggle.   I believe we have taken the armed struggletoday to every corner of our country.   We have, for instance,spread the armed struggle to areas which in the past few yearswere not affected by armed struggle.   We know that for a longtime the armed struggle tended to be confined to the Transvaaland Natal but this year our units have spread armed activitiesto the whole of the Cape Province as well as to the Orange FreeState.  Our units have been in action in the Western Cape attackingpolice stations and installations of the enemy.   What is importantis that we have\n4b converged /...\nMR DU PLESSIS 532 J H CRONJE\n   converged with the forces on the ground, what I mean by thisis that the militant upsurge of our people has thrown up thousandsof activists, who have reached the same conclusion as the ANC,that the crucial aspect of our struggle is the armed one.   Wehave got young militants literally numbering thousands confrontingthe enemy.   At the beginning of course, these militant youthsconfronted the enemy with stones, petrol bombs but now we haveintroduced an armed element to the militancy of our young people.  We have introduced hand grenades.   I think this has deepenedthe development of the process we began to see last year, thegrowing ungovernability of our country as a result of the armedelement of the struggle, including MK and other armed units, militaryunits of our people which are born out of the struggle.   Ourpeople have utilised the skills we have imparted on them, dealwith the police, community councils, collaborationist elements,by so doing we have rendered most townships ungovernable.\"",

            "A specially built bomb was acquired from JoeVerster of Special Forces which was the run-up to the later BSB.  There were particular preparations made with regard to the particularmodel of car which Pete Ntuli drove in, which is a Toyota Cressida,so that it would have been possible to fit the bomb to the bottomof this vehicle.   We co-operated with the SADF Special Forcesin terms of the general instructions given by Brigadier Schoon.  Myself, Captain Hechter and Captain Jaap Van Jaarsveld wentwith the bomb to Kwandabele.   Later in the afternoon, CaptainChris Kendall, the Branch Commanding Officer of this SecurityPolice in Bronkelspruit who was responsible for Kwandabele, alsoarrived.   Gouws and Oosthuizen were attached to the Murder &Armed Robbery section of the South African Police which investigatedthe activities of the Mbkhoto in Kwandabele under Brigadier DantjieVan Wyk.   We met Mr Oosthuizen and Gouws at Siabuswa(?), whichwas then the seat of the Kwandabele Government.   We waited allday to see how we could attach the bomb to Pete Ntuli's vehicle.  That particular evening there was a meeting at the house ofthe Chief Minister in the Ministerial complex in Kwandabele.  There was an open piece of veld across from the Ministerial complexfrom where we watched the complex.   When it had become dark,myself, Hechter and Captain Kendall drove to the complex in CaptainKendall's vehicle.   We parked next to Pete Ntuli's vehicle andI sent Kendall to the Chief Minister to tell him that I wouldlike to meet with the Chief Minister, whom I had not met yet atthat time.   While Kendall was in the house of the Chief Minister,Hechter sneaked underneath Ntuli's Cressida vehicle and mountedthe bomb.   The Minister of Police, Mr Nglameni, then came out\n1b of /...\nMR DU PLESSIS 558 J H CRONJE\nof the Chief Minister's house.   I approached him and greetedhim and we had a conversation.   After the bomb was planted underNtuli's vehicle, we returned in Kendall's vehicle.   We then droveback to the open piece of veld in front of the main gates of theMinisterial complex.   It was then agreed that Oosthuizen andGouws would handle the two distance detonators.   These distance-controlleddetonators were set so that the bomb would explode in a distantpart of the road which Ntuli normally used.   There was a mechanismto prevent that innocent persons would be hurt.   The bomb wouldonly explode 30 seconds after the detonator had been set so thatthe bomb would explode in an unbuilt area, which indeed did happen.  After the bomb exploded we drove out to the base of Gouws andOosthuizen which was about four kilometres from Siabuswa.   Whenwe arrived at the base we received information from the policeradio with regard to the explosion and with Brigadier Van Wykand some of his staff, we returned to the scene of the explosion.  The Commissioner of Police of Kwandabele, Brigadier Van Niekerk,also arrived at the scene.   The next day I went to BrigadierCoetzee, the Commissioner's office, and the Kwandabele Governmentclaimed that I was responsible for the bomb.  The matter was investigatedby the head of the Detective Services, General Schutte - the Chiefof CID I would presume.   I was never questioned in this regard.  I had to hand in a report and I was not involved in the legalinquest or gave testimony at the legal inquest.   Special Forceswould initially have performed this operation with us, but inthe event we only received the bomb from Special Forces.   Mbkhotoacted in a similar manner to the ANC and attempted to destabilisethe area in a manner similar to\n1b that /...\nMR DU PLESSIS 559 J H CRONJE\nthat of the ANC.   This occurred by means of burning down housesand schools and by means of consumer and school boycotts.   ThenMbkhoto and the ANC had the same purposes, namely political unrest,murder, assault and destabilisation.   Shops were closed, waterand lights were cut off.   We received information that Pete Ntuliand his Mbkhoto on one particular evening burned down a houseand that two children came out of the house and that Pete Ntulithrew the children back into the fire.   This case was investigated,with no consequences.   We received information that Pete Ntuliand the Mbkhoto's intentions were to make Kwandabele ungovernableand to make the existing Government ineffective and to destabiliseKwandabele.   The Mbkhoto of Pete Ntuli had the same destabilisingeffect in Kwandabele as the ANC.   In effect the Mbkhoto achievedthe purposes of the ANC with regard to the destabilisation ofKwandabele.",

The explosiveswere in a black tin or plate covering which was in a square form.  This bomb also had a safety time mechanism.   After the bombwas mounted you pulled out the safety pin after which the bombwould be activated 30 minutes later.

I do know from my conversations with Sgt Gouwsand W/O Oosthuizen, who at that time were part of the investigativeteam, that there were large numbers of dossiers.

In addition he achieved the purposes of the ANC quiteobviously, that was quite clear to everybody.  At the time thecomrades were very strongly present in Kwandabele, for one tomake a distinction between when a comrade or when Mr Ntuli burneddown a house in Kwandabele, that was very difficult.   As faras we were concerned, the Security Branch, he simply advancedthe purposes of the ANC at that time by making the area ungovernable,entirely ungovernable.   At that time there were major discussions,negotiations, with a view to the independence of Kwandabele butin view of the unrest this would not have been possible.  It wasfirst necessary to stabilise the area.   If I'm not entirely mistaken,shortly after this incident the Kwandabele members of Parliamentwent down to Cape Town to negotiate with the National Party withregard to the independence, but this is only what I have heard,this is hearsay I only heard from the investigative officers thatthe Cabinet members had gone down to Cape Town.

He was a comrade and he had been arrestedon a few occasions and at one stage was charged with arson andpublic violence.    Then there was Samuel Masilela, he was 16years old.   He was in Form 1 at Mamelodi High School.   Accordingto his mother he was also a comrade.   Her recollection is thaton one occasion the police had come to the house looking for him.  He had never been detained or charged.   Then there was SiphoPhillip Sibanyoni, he was 15 years old.   He was also a, accordingto...(end of side 2)...he was in Std 9 at the Japhta MshlanguSchool.   His mother is unaware of any political activity by him.  He was never detained or arrested by the police.   Then therewas Thomas Phiri.   According to his sister he was 22 years oldat the time of his disappearance.   He was in Std 9, we don'thave the name of the school.   He was also an activist and a comrade,but had never been either detained or arrested.   Then there wasJeremiah Magagula.   According to his mother he was 16 years oldwhen he disappeared.   He was attending the Mthombo Primary Schoolin Mamelodi.   He was a comrade, politically active but had neverbeen arrested.   Then there was Morris Nkabinde, he was 19 yearsold when he disappeared.   He was also a comrade, although hehad never been arrested.   Then there was Matthews Promapana Lerutla.  He was 15 years old when he disappeared.   According to hismother he was also a comrade.   He had been taken by the policeon one occasion but was not charged.   Then there was StephenMakena.   \n4.

At a certain stagein Atteridgeville, when I was still a very young constable, westill used the old Hippo vehicles, we came around a corner andthere were two vehicles parked next to the road.   A group ofnot youth but children, and I doubt if any of them were olderthan 14, were at that time busy pouring out petrol over thesevehicles.   My Commanding Officer at that time, a Captain, butI do not remember who he was, gave instructions to shoot on thesepeople.   I then told him \"don't do that, don't do that theseare children\".  We sat down and drove off.   The childrenthen dispersed rapidly when they noted us.   A block away fromthis incident, both of these vehicles were in flames.   At thattime, and this must have been in the years of 1976 and later inthe 80's, the youth were politicised and activised to such anextent that they had no regard for property or life left.   Briefly,after I was stationed with the Security Branch, I was given theinstruction or I had rather been requested by the Shoshunguwepolice station, I was the service officer at that time, to comeout.   There was a person arrested known as \"Naughty\"and this person had the entire Shoshunguwe area in the palm ofhis hand.   If he would say that there was a consumer boycott,then that\n1. consumer /...\nMR DU PLESSIS 650 J HECHTER\nconsumer boycott would have occurred.   If he gave instructionsfor a school boycott they would have occurred.  He ruled the entirearea with an iron hand.   I still don't entirely understand theentire story of activists and people like that, but then I wentthere and I visited Naughty in the cell.   On my way down thecorridor I saw a young boy and then I walked back to the Sergeantand I asked him where this person is that I have to see becausethere was only a child in the back.   The Sergeant then laughedand told me that this is indeed the person.   I walked over, Ispoke to Naughty, and I asked him if he was the terror of Shoshunguwe.  At that time he was 15 years of age and he ruled Shoshunguwewith an iron hand.   I do not know if he received his instructionsfrom older persons, from adults, but at that time I was very inexperiencedmyself.   I had an interview with him and then returned to myoffice and I was flabbergasted, I could hardly believe that aperson of such a young age could be so deeply involved in politicalactivity and could exercise such a degree of power.
