<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... I'm going to ask all the representatives to do the same, after my colleagues have indicated who they are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Advocate Leah Gcabashe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> I'm Attorney J B Sibanyoni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I'm attorney Lawly Shane.  I'm representing several applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman I'm the Evidence Leader.  I'm also representing several victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shane there were some colleagues of yours who were present earlier today.  What has happened to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Sir there are a few who are present.  They are all in fact present today, in the gallery, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, it's this matter of ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> This is the matter of ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it just a question of space that they're not sitting there next to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> That is the reason, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman may I just be so rude as to interrupt.  The first applicant will be Mr Nkosi Bongani.  His application appears in the bundle at page 132.  One three two, Mr chairman.  Thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman I represent the applicant, his application is contained from pages 132 to 157 in three separate applications.  They were all made on the same date, and the last application in fact was signed before a Commissioner of Oaths.  So I would submit that the application is properly before you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> His three applications, does it refer to the same incidents, or offences for which he applies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Sir, in fact, the first application in fact deals with the offences that he will apply for, that is murder.  The other applications are of a general nature.  The second one, because of its generality, will also cover the application murder or attempted murder.  The other acts mentioned do not consist of gross violations of human rights, but he will deal with them, because he is testifying on them, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> See Mr Shane, on page 141, relates to an application the details of the incidents for which application is made is not in this document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I think, on one occasion when we last met in these kinds of circumstances, and I received a report that when a meeting between the legal representatives took place, that I was willing to accept supplementary affidavits to explain these general applications.  We as a Committee are stuck with the High Court decision, that applications for general amnesty, without specific details, is not a matter that we can deal with.  And in the absence of an affidavit of some sort which would fit in with what is contained in the application itself, our hands are stuck.  I thought I'd just mention it to you, and leave the rest to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Thank you, sir.  If I may just mention, I consulted with my client for the first time on Saturday.  Logistically it hasn't been possible to furnish supplementary affidavit.  I think if we deal with the acts, there are two acts mentioned on page 133, which we'll start with.  They are clear acts of murder, for which the applicant will seek amnesty, and then there will be, from this applicant, there is a further action which occurred on a certain day which I would ask be covered, although not specifically mentioned in his application, I would ask that it be covered as well.  But we will deal with it, the murders, the first two murders, if it may please the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it, or are these two murders in the first application those incidents or offences, which would be referred to in the second application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well Mr Shane it is beyond me how an affidavit could not have been typed and signed between Saturday morning and this morning, but be that as it may.  Is it not possible to have it done before this applicant is finished with his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Well sir, I think it would be possible.  It might.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I'm going to give you the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Otherwise Mr Chairman, what we could do, I do have other applicants present.  We could let this one stand down and I'll then - we could do that as well.  I am ready with another two applicants that are sitting here, and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I'm far from wanting to say how you must run this application.  I'd leave that decision entirely in your hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Well sir, as you've mentioned the supplementary affidavit would be desirable, I would then ask that this applicant stand down until later and I would call Mbusi Passion Mbatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where would I find his application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Pages 58 to 64, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We don't have a similar problem in this application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> No sir, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mbatha.  Mr Shane could you ask your client to - Mr Mbatha what language would you prefer to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you any objection to the taking of the oath?  What number, what channel would you use?  Number four.  I'm going to repeat the question.  Have you any objections to the taking of the oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No objection, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you please stand.  Do you swear that the evidence you're about to give will be the truth and nothing but the truth?  Raise your right hand and say, so help me God.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MBUSI PASSION MBATHA:</span> (sworn, states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please be seated.  Yes Mr Shane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SHANE:</span> Thank you.  Mr Mbatha, you are applying for amnesty for the crime of murder on one Beki Khanyile.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> You did, in your application, erroneously mention a killing of a Stephen Radebe.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Will you please repeat the question, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> In your original application for amnesty which you made on the 10th of May 1997, you also mentioned the killing of one Stephen Radebe.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I was not present during that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> That is erroneously written on by the person who assisted you to complete your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Can you tell the Commission you were, is it correct that you were a member of the African National Congress, as well as a member of the Self-Defence Unit at the Tambo Slovo Penduka section of Tokoza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> When did you join the Self-Defence Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I cannot remember the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> The year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> This person, Beki Khanyile, who you killed.  Can you tell the Commission about him?  That is, that will say, his political affiliations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, make it easier, why did you kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Can you answer that question?  Why did you decide that you were to kill Beki Khanyile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> He was an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Was that common knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that was common knowledge.  Anyone who was in Tambo section knew that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now, what else besides being an IFP member, what did he do for the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> He was also a taxi driver of the hit squad.  He used to drive vehicles where there would be IFP members inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right.  Now, that was also common knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sir, Mr Shane could you just give the technician a chance just to</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, now before Beki Khanyile was killed, will you please tell the Commission ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't get his previous answer.  You asked him what else did he do aside from being a member of IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Will you please repeat what the deceased Beki Khanyile did besides being a member of the IFP.  That is, in connection with his driving of hit squads.  Will you repeat that please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I said he used to drive the hostel kombis.  He used to drive vehicles for IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, now before Beki, before Beki Khanyile was killed, can you tell this Commission what actually happened to your family's home at the hands of members of the Inkatha Freedom Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> IFP members wanted us to join IFP, and they wanted us to sign the IFP forms, and we were running away from them.  They were forcing us to do all those things and they wanted to harass the parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes, and what happened to your family' house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> My family ran away because they could see that a friend of mine was killed, was involved in Beki's case, and his parents were killed.  They managed to escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes, and did the IFP not move into your family's home?  Members of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, they went inside.  They couldn't find anyone because the people had ran away at the time.  That's what, that's the information that I got, home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And is it correct that they started to live in your family's home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> My family house was not the only house that was occupied.  They occupied the whole area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And that included, obviously included your family's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now, it was during 1993 when Beki Khanyile was killed, in fact in December.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I cannot remember when.  I cannot remember the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Will you tell the Commission what happened on that day.  You were patrolling in the street ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before we carry on.  Mr Steenkamp, have we got a date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman we don't have a specific date for this incident at all, if that is what you're asking me, sir.  Sir, if I'm, sorry to be so rude Mr Chairman.  If I'm, if my facts are correct, as far as we could establish there were no police dockets opened for this specific incident.  I am in the process of confirming that again, because we reinvestigated this matter, this specific matter again, but as far as we could establish there was no police docket opened.  I do know that in the one matter, the Khanyile matter, the victims were informed however.  Thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Will you please tell the learned Commissioner and learned members what happened when you were patrolling in the street in Tokoza, in your own words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Do you want to know what was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I want to know what happened vis a vis the murder of Beki Khanyile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We were patrolling the streets at Buthelezi Street.  When we came from the office Beki was already captured by the other members of SDU who knew what he was, what he was doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> This office, are you referring to a house in Tokoza which was used by the Self-Defence Unit as an office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And is it in this house where the Self-Defence Unit kept their AK-47 weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> You, after you were patrolling you say you arrived at this office, which you call an office, and the deceased was already there.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Will you please repeat the question, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> After you were patrolling, you went to the SDU office, and at that office you found the deceased, Beki Khanyile.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And he had been brought there by other members of the Self-Defence Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Will you tell what happened after you saw him in this office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> He was already there when we arrived.  The, as the Inkatha people were our enemies we knew that if we found one IFP member that person should be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We found Beki Khanyile there in the office.  He was going to be killed because he was an IFP member, the members, the organisation, the member of the organisation that was regarded as bad people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now he was being guarded by other SDU members.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Who were those members who were guarding him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was quite a large number of people.  All the SDU members were there because that was a place where they used to meet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Mr Mbatha, - sorry Mr Shane, give us an idea as to how many members were there, you found there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I cannot be able to estimate because it was quite a number, a large number of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So if I just said 30, 50, is that the type of number you are thinking of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> From 50 upwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Who was your commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Muchacho was the commander at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Was Muchacho there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And the area we are talking about is Tambo Slovo, so Muchacho was commander of Tambo Slovo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, he was the commander of Tambo Slovo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Mr Shane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now, in that office you took an AK-47.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> What did you do with that AK-47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Can you remember where you shot him?  Where the bullet landed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I cannot remember, because it was dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where did you aim it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I aimed it at his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which part of his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> In front, in his front part of his, in the front part of his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you know it was the deceased there at that house when you arrived?  Could you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Will you please repeat the question, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you arrived there you say you saw the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you able to identify him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I could identify him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It wasn't too dark to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was not dark because he was in the house and the light was on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, when you shot him, you say it was too dark to say where on his body he was injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.  We shot him outside the Nkatije School, it was in the veld.  Nkatije LP School.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So he was transferred from that house to a school yard for the purposes of killing him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was not in the school yard, just between the two schools.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where it was dark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, it was dark there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> How many shots did you fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I couldn't count the shots because I was using an automatic rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> After you fired your shots, what did you do, with your weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I handed it over to Ernest Buthelezi, who was also a member of SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Is Ernest Buthelezi also know as Mzwake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is Mzwake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> What did Mzwake do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> He took the firearm and he shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> He shot the same person?  Beki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And then what did he do after he shot Beki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> He handed it over to Muchacho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes, and what did Muchacho do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> He also fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now, it is thus possible that either you, or Mzwake, or Muchacho's shots caused the death of Beki Khanyile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> But you were the one who fired the most shots.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Did you, or do you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the purpose of different people shooting the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The treatment that they gave to us, we just felt like we should just kill them, we had no alternative, it was the anger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I can accept that, or understand it, but the point is that you shot a number of shots into his chest.  Why did other people have to shoot him as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It is because they were victims of harassment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, you don't understand my question.  Why was it necessary for Muchacho and for Buthelezi to also shoot at the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Maybe they can respond to that question themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you give the firearm to Mzwake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not give them, but Mzwake took the firearm.  It's not that I gave them the firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Did you, after firing your shots, did you tell Mzwake or Muchacho that they should also shoot the deceased, or did you not say anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not tell them to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> So is it correct that you had absolutely no control over their actions whatsoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Excuse me Mr Shane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>	Mr Mbatha, after you shot the deceased, did he die immediately, or was he still alive when Mzwake took the firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not look at him, but I know that he later died.  But I'm not sure what bullet killed him, but I know that he later died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But after you shot at him, did he fall down immediately, or was he still standing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> He fell.  He looked like someone who was trying to stand up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Sir do you think that you had any other alternative in doing what you were doing?  In other words, did you have a choice of not shooting the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not have an alternative.  I was forced to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes, now can you explain that.  Who forced you?  Were you given orders?  Can you explain what you've just said a bit more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The things, their actions, things that they used to do at Penduka section.  As I've already explained that he used to drive the taxis, IFP taxis.  He was also an IFP member, and IFP members used to harass people.  Because they also killed parents of one of our comrades, and even today we don't even know who those people were, but we only know that they were IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Did you have any general orders from the commanders of the Self-Defence Units to kill IFP members and informers and drivers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We knew the targets, we knew the perpetrators of violence, because we were staying at that same, same area that was next to the hostel.  We wouldn't wait for the orders.  Everyone would see, everyone could see the perpetrators.  We knew, all the people who ran away from Penduka section, we knew the perpetrators.  We knew the IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Was there a general order from your commanders in the Self-Defence Unit, that IFP members should be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> After running away from that section were fighting, all of us, we were fighting the IFP.  No-one commanded anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Is there anything else that you might have left out, that you haven't told this Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Are you talking about this incident, things that are connected to this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> There is nothing else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I don't believe the families of the victim, Beki Khanyile, are present, but can you say now, after this is all finished, what do you feel about what you did to Beki Khanyile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> What I did, I feel very bad about this incident, but I did not have an alternative.  I had no choice.  There was nothing else to do.  I feel sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now, if I might just mention this, we are coming to another situation where the party that you support, the African National Congress, is fighting and election and fighting against the IFP this year.  Can this happen - do you think this can happen again, for this election that is coming?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Mr Shane, just so that I can understand the question ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, we are at peace now, that will never happen again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> That is evidence Mr Chairman.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SHANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, if you would allow me one question to the applicant.  Mr Mbatha, maybe I have missed it, but can you tell us what happened to the body of Mr Khanyile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Will you please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Do you know what happened to the body of the deceased after he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We dispersed after the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Because according to your application -Mr Chairman I'm referring you to page 59, paragraph 4, this is now point number 2, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>	I will read for you:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>"...IFP driver shot with an AK-47 and burnt"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>And if you page to page 61, with all respect Mr Chairman, the last paragraph, starting with Beki, four lines down:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>"...some decided to kill him.  He was burnt, as a lesson."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>The reason I'm asking you is because you mentioned this in your application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> After the shooting we dispersed.  Maybe the other comrades who were there after the killing did that.  That is Ernest and Muchacho.  I did not go back to the scene.  I last saw him after the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you know - let me put it this way, as is contained in your application, is it true that his body was burned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> That is the information that I got later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you heard that this had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  That's all, thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you Judge.  Mr Mbatha, just a bit of clarity on one or two points.  You joined the SDU in 1992.  Can you try and work out very roughly for us, just to estimate, whether this incident occurred in 1992, which is the year you joined, or the following year, in 1993.  Just can you attempt to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I need time to think about it.  I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You see, on page 59, the note here under 9.A.2 says the date's December 1993 and in brackets</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>"...both attacked on the same day."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>Now, think about this.  December 1993.  1994 was the election year.  Would this have been an accurate recollection?  Just help us through that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes before the elections was in 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So are you saying, what's written on this form, December 1993, having thought about it right now, is more or less accurate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that could be accurate, if my memory serves me well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Now, your house in Tambo Slovo, the house that you were forced to move out of, where exactly was that house?  Just give us the nearest main street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was in Khuamlo Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Now would that have been very close to one of the hostels, on Khumalo Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, it was nearer to Mshayazafe Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You say that your parents were forced to leave this house essentially because they feared for the whole family.  Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Did they know that you had been involved in Beki's killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Do you mean after they had run away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> No, as one of the reasons that they moved from the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, they did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You talked about your, the office, the SDU office.  Where exactly was this, in Tambo Slovo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was in Slovo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Now, I have a bit of a difficulty in following through the incident you relate, from the time you arrived at the office to the time that Beki was killed.  Am I right in assuming that the distance from the office to the veld, where he was killed, is quite a long distance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It's not a very long distance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> How did you get from the office to the veld.  Did you walk in a group, as part of a group?  Did a few of you get into a vehicle?  Just take us through that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We walked to the veld, because it was not far away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Did the entire group walk to the veld, or did very few, including yourself, Muchacho and Mzwake, walk to the veld?  Just take us through that.  How many people were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The whole group of SDU members were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> The firearm that you used, did you personally take it at the office, or was it given to you when you got to the veld?  Help me with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I took the firearm in the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> When you got to the office, you have told us that you knew already that Beki was going to be killed.  Did anybody in particular say, let's go and do it now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Now, Muchacho</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The whole group of SDU's left the office to kill.  We volunteered myself and Muchacho we volunteered to do the killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So you are saying there was a short discussion at the office, and at the end of that short discussion you and Muchacho volunteered to do the killing.  Would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, because we were the people who pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And it was the general consensus of the group, after that discussion, that Beki was going to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Muchacho as your SDU leader in that particular section, did he essentially lead all of you in this discussion and then later on in the killing as well?  In terms of giving orders or giving guidance as to what has to be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, we left all of us, no-one discussed anything with anyone and he did not give orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Alright.  A slightly different area.  Are there any other SDU activities that you were involved in at Tambo Slovo?  I think, for example, patrols.  Were you involved in that at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It's only patrolling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Patrols that involved harassing and sometimes assaulting, even in the most minor way, the people who you were dealing with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you Mr Mbatha, thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Mbatha you say in this office which was used by the SDU, or the house which was used by the SDU as an office, there were about 50 members of the SDU's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now besides yourself and Muchacho, who else from the SDU's was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I cannot remember who.  It was quite a large number of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But Mzwake was still there, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now why don't you mention him at least, because you referred to him in your evidence in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The reason for me not to mention him, I know that he is in this case, he is around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But didn't you expected to tell us everything what happened, if you remember some of the people, even if they are applicants here, to give us the full picture of what happened?  Are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> What I'm say is, Mzwake was present, and Muchacho was also present, but I cannot remember the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> For how long have you been patrolling together when this incident took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Patrolling as SDU members, is that your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I cannot remember.  It was quite a long time, I cannot remember because we used to patrol day and night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was it about six months, or about a year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I think it was more than 12 months, or, it was more than 12 months.  I am not sure as to the period, but it was a long time, it was happening, had been happening for a very long time.  More than a year, approximately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now lastly on this issue, if that was the case, you have been patrolling together for more than a year, and there were about 50 people at that house, obviously you will remember some of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Do you want to know the date when we started patrolling, or on that particular day when, I do not understand your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How, maybe - How are you not able to tell us at least some of the people who were at that house immediately before the people went to kill the deceased?  Because you said that the whole group, as far as you're concerned, was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The problem is one, that the house was full and I was standing outside.  The house was so full and the space was not enough for all of us.  I had to stand outside because I couldn't get inside the house.  I was standing next to the door, but all the members of SDU's were present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mbatha I want to warn you, you're under oath.  Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it's in your interests to make a full disclosure as far as you can.  Correct?  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Earlier in your evidence you told us you were inside the house, that's why you were able to identify the deceased with the light in the house.  Do you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> ...(not translated)</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you tell us you were not in the house, you were outside. ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I was at the door and he was sitting in the dining room.  I could see him.  He was sitting in the dining room, I was standing at the door.  I could see him 'though I was standing at the door, I could be able, I was in a position to see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, can you not tell us then, as far as you can remember, who else of the members of that SDU was present at the house, either with you outside, or near the door, or inside under the light?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I remember Gamsu, he is now late, and Thabo, and Manelo and some of them are now late.  Those are the people that I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you only remember mostly dead people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, those are the only people that I can think of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you trying to withhold the names of colleagues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have difficulty remembering those who are alive today who were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No I cannot remember their names, those who are alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you able to tell us who were your colleagues patrolling that time?  Not necessarily on that day, but during that period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I used to patrol with Muchacho, Mzwake, Manelo.  I cannot remember this other name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Right, how was Beki transported from the house to the veld?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We walked with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was he walking on this own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We, he was walking by himself and the side, we were walking side by side with him and the others that I cannot remember their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was he fastened, was he dragged, or was he just walking on his own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No he was not tied, he was just walking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now on the last aspect.  You say there was no order, nobody issued an order, that he must be killed.  Was there but a decision that IFP members should be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> That was obvious, that if we would come across the IFP members, those IFP members should be killed because they also had the same in mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> At what stage was that decision taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> When we run away, when we ran away from Penduka, going to Slovo.  We couldn't meet eye to eye with IFP members and they used to harass us and they wanted us to attend their meetings and they used to whip the other with sjamboks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did you then hold a meeting and decided that you will attack and kill any IFP member known in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We took a decision that we are going to protect our community against harassment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes but, protecting them - what I'm interested in is to say, any IFP member would be a target in protecting the enemy, and the action which would be taken would be to kill that IFP member.  Was there such a meeting where the decision was taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you ever go into that house, that day when the deceased was ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Do you mean the day of Beki's death?  Yes I was present in that office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Inside the house?  Not at the door, inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> If I'm saying I was at the door you know that my position is that was you could see what's happening.  You look more like a person who is inside because you are able to see everything that is taking place inside the house although you are standing at the door.  I was standing at the door.  I could see Beki.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the furthest you went into that house that day?  Before you took him to the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> When I went inside it was when I went to fetch the firearm when we were about to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you did go in.  Not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I went in as I wanted to fetch the firearm, and we took him with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you agree you did enter deep into the house, and not just stood at the door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not spend time, I just got into the house and took the firearm.  Yes I got inside, and I took the firearm, and I left the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was the firearm held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The firearm was in the dining room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it in the same room as where you saw the deceased from the front door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it just laying on the floor, or on a chair, or on a table, or was it being held in a cupboard, or a safe, or what is the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was on the floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what rank in the SDU did you hold?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I was just an ordinary SDU member without a rank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you not supposed to - or let me ask you this.  Did you just go fetch that firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I took the firearm at the same time as they were taking him out to the veld that was next to the Nkatije school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You went on your own to pick up that firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> That was the firearm that was going to be used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but you did it on your own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I took the firearm because it was time to go and kill Beki.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who keeps control, or who kept control, over the firearms of that unit, or was everybody able to gain access to these firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Will you please repeat your question sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who in the unit had the power of control over all the firearms which the unit used from time to time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Our commanders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many commanders were there in that unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Muchacho was the commander who was present at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you not supposed to obtain permission from him to fetch that firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I was not supposed to get permission from him, because I knew what Beki was all about and the other people knew also.  There was no reason for us to wait for a command because we knew him very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I'm not asking about a command to kill him.  I'm asking about a command or permission to pick that firearm up, because it was essentially under the control of the only commander there.  Or can anybody have walked in there and just pick up a firearm and do what he wants to with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The firearm was already there to kill him, that is why I'm saying it was on the floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is your commander an applicant in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> He is, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you on speaking terms, or have you made attempts to visit, the family of the deceased, since his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> That did not occur to us, because Beki was an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you, is this senseless war between, or in that area, not over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It is over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I'm happy to hear that.  Was there no attempt to go make friends, for humanity's sake?  To say how sorry you were that this unfortunate situation had developed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> That is why I came forward here to apply for amnesty and ask for forgiveness from Beki his family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you prepared to go to them afterwards, now to say how sorry you are and to see if they will forgive you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I am willing or prepared, I'm willing to get their forgiveness, but I have no alternative at the time.  If I am to see them I will able, I'm prepared to look at them and ask for forgiveness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And to become friends?  In the circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It seems that that, that fight at the time, was related to possibly the elections that occurred shortly thereafter.  Am I correct?  Maybe there were other reasons, but the elections was also ...(indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> What led to that situation, the IFP members were harassing us and they wanted us to join Inkatha and they were assaulting us, that's why they killed Muchacho's parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that, that was related to electioneering, isnt' it?  Because all the parties involved wanted votes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I do not understand your question.  What do you mean when you are talking about elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The 1994 elections, was four or five months, four months, after this killing.  And we have done a couple of these matters before.  In my view there was a relationship between that war and the elections.  Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I do understand, because IFP members were  calling us ANC members and they killed a comrade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now we've got another election coming, this year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I'm aware of that coming election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you agree with me that it wouldn't be a good idea for a war to start again in those circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, there is no need for war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And would you oppose any fighting because of the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Will you please repeat your question, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you oppose any such attempt to cause damage to the people and to create a war, because of the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> All we need now is peace, and vote peacefully and let the winners win.  That's all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now I want to put it to you in this sense, that for all these years some of our people have been used by various institutions, and these people caused various problems for election purposes.  And it is not always our own people's fault that these problems are created.  And that's why I'm asking you, if such attempts to cause fights between our people, irrespective of which party they belong to, would you oppose that? - because nobody benefits by it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes I'll try and oppose such people who would try and fight because of the forthcoming elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, arising from your questioning, if I might just put two short questions to the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>	Muchacho was your commander, correct?  He was in charge of you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, he was the commander of Tambo section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And his orders you would have obeyed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, if that was rightfully done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now when you went into the house or the office and you took the AK-47, Muchacho was present, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Did Muchacho do anything to stop you from taking that AK-47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, he did not attempt to stop me, because he was also angry towards this person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> So in other words, the fact that he did not stop you taking that AK-47, would you regard that as being similar to his approval of your actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> So you also, thus, were basically acting with his authority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I, is, do you want, are you asking whether I did this under Muchacho's command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> You've already said you did this under Muchacho's command.  What I'm saying to you is the fact that Muchacho, who was aware of what you did, did nothing to prevent you, him being your commander.  Do you not regard that as possibly him showing his approval of your actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> One last question.  Let us assume that you were not there at all that day.  Would Beki Khanyile still have died, do you think?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, he would still be killed, because I was not the only person that I knew everything about Beki.  I was not the only person that knew everything about Beki.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> That is all thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SHANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shane I'm going to give you an opportunity to address us if you wish after all the evidence.  You have told me that you've got another appointment after this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman, I am available for the rest of the week and I would, in the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I need to know whether the order in which you people are going to lead your evidence, has that been agreed to as being the most appropriate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Sir I would submit that the most appropriate thing to do next is to call the person, Victor Mabaso, also known as Muchacho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're not listening to me.  I'm asking has all the representatives who have an interest in this matter, and will appear for various applicants, have you people amongst yourselves agreed that the way you plan to submit the evidence is the best for everybody concerned?  In other words, that you would finish all your witnesses first, before any of the other representatives come sit where you are sitting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Sir frankly we have not actually discussed that type of strategy.  I for one, most of my other colleagues' matters are going to actually be referred to chambers.  From my point of view, I am here tomorrow and I would like to, if possible I could run the whole of tomorrow and in a sequence, but we have not really made that arrangement between ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All I'm trying to find out is if it's any, if it's going to cause anybody inconvenience if one of your colleagues continue with one of their cases in your absence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Absolutely, it will not be in any way prejudicial to any of the applicants sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there a case that we can proceed with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I understand from my colleagues, I see they are at the back, they are debating it sir.  If could we just find out from them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm going to adjourn now, and then you people can come see me in five or ten minutes.</p>
