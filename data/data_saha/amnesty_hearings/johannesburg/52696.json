Two weeks before the time we were already told that we should be on standby 24 hours because the revolution's going to start.   Phil Klopper put it clearly to us that General Oelofse wanted to see bodies and that we should fulfil hard options, and later Phil Klopper told us that General Oelofse gave instruction that we had to have a roadblock and during this roadblock we must also intercept weapons which would be taken into our towns in order to kill our people, farmers and children, and then we would use these weapons against the ANC, SACP alliance, as well as the PAC, and the leader of the AWB, Terreblanche, also told us at several meetings that we must cause chaos and make sure that the election on the 24th of April do not take place.\"\n\tNow I find a few things strange.
