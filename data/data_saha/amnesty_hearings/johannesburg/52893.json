I see that there are a few places where there is reference to Queenstown and there is a reference to Marina and I am not sure what that is and then there is a reference to Soweto.\n\tI am looking more specifically at paragraph 9(c) on page 4 of the record which deals with the question of victims.  There seems to be a whole sort of broad reference to things that had happened at Queenstown and (c)(ii) for example, talks about the Zola 3, Soweto and then it refers to Queenstown. \n\tThen I think the word is Marina or Marino, I am not sure what is after the word, but at Queenstown.  It appears as if there is some reference, and then in (c)(iv), there is again Queenstown, reference to Queenstown, Marina, Zola 3, Soweto and I assume on the second line, it is Protea police station, Queenstown police station.\n\tAre you submitting that the applicant purports to deal with these further Eastern Cape matters that you are referring us to, when he refers to all these sort of places where incidents have happened?  I see also on page 5, paragraph 12(a), he does refer to some court proceeding in the High Court, Johannesburg and in the Queenstown regional court.\n\tAnd then 12(c) refers to terrorism, or the Terrorism Act, attempted murder and I assume that there is a reference to explosives and the possession of firearms.

The first one relating to a shoot-out between the applicant and members of the police at Marienhoek in Queenstown in the Eastern Cape, as well as the incident relating to the arrest, the subsequent arrest of the applicant, whom according to Mr Mhlaba, who represents him today, has been a fugitive, his subsequent arrest on the 24th of February 1994, when he was in unlawful possession of explosives and arms.\n\tThe application form has been completed by the applicant himself without any legal assistance and that much is apparent upon a reading of the application form.\n\tIt is not unusual in the experience of the Committee to have application forms completed under those circumstances, purporting to deal with a number of incidents, which should form the subject matter of the amnesty application, in a round about way and not as clearly and precisely and ...(indistinct) as obviously the case is where an applicant is assisted legally in completing the application form.\n\tMr Mhlaba has drawn our attention to the fact that in the bundle of documents before us, there is indication of notice having been given in terms of Section 19(4) of Act 34 of 1995, to two members of the South African Police Services in Queenstown, who it appears, are interested parties in respect of the shoot-out involving the applicant.\n\tThe application form itself, at various places, various sections of the form, purports to refer to not only an incident in Soweto but also to incidents in Queenstown.  Adv Steenkamp, the Leader of Evidence of the Committee, who appears here today, has indicated to us that although this matter is not, or does not relate to a trial that was heard long ago, the records relating to the - particularly the Queenstown, Eastern Cape incidents, are not available.  He has indicated to us that Mr Mhlaba has also searched for those records, and have also been unable to locate them, with the result that as is normally the case in these applications, the relevant court records are not before the Committee.\n\tWe are however satisfied that no prejudice would result from us granting the application to amend the amnesty application in the sense which I have referred to.  We are satisfied that all of the interested parties have been given notice and we are satisfied that as perhaps incomplete as it might appear on the face of it, that the application form itself, does refer to the incidents which forms the subject matter of the amendment.\n\tWe accordingly grant the order to amend the amnesty application, in the sense of including the incident relating to the shoot-out in November 1993 as well as the incident relating to the arrest of the applicant on 24 February 1994.\n\tMr Mhlaba, do you want to proceed?",

At a house that was found opposite a shop, the shop is called Kanyile's, I ran into the house, trying to show that I am avoiding them.

It so happened that on this particular day when we were on duty, the Protea police station, or the police stationed to the Protea police station, had come to attack us.  We had an operation clean up that we had instituted locally.\n\tIt so happened that on the 2nd of October during the year 1992, I assigned some guys from the Self Defence Unit, as the Commander of the Self Defence Unit, to go patrol around the residential area.\n\tAfter having issued this instruction to go and patrol, there was a specific request that the community should switch off the streetlights, because they were going to disturb us in the duty, all the work that we had assigned ourselves to do.\n\tThe community permitted us to switch off the lights.  One of the Self Defence Unit members came to me, to report that I was being sought at a certain house and I had to go there personally to that particular house.  I went into that house because I knew the people who resided there and as I got inside the house, I requested to see the owner of the house, which was a woman.  I came across the woman, I spoke to her, I greeted her and further pointed out that we request as the community, for her to switch off the front light.\n\tShe asked me the reason why and I explained to her the reason.  I even explained and identified myself, and explained that I was from the Self Defence Unit and that I was carrying a certain duty.  I was attacked by everybody in that house.\n\tThere is a person with whom we didn't see eye to eye and his name is Vugani.  I was accosted, manhandled.  I was kept hostage and I had a hand grenade in my possession.  They tried to take away the hand grenade.\n\tWhilst, within the same breath, I was trying to explain that I was not attacking them, or fighting them, but I had come to explain to them as to why they had to switch off the front light.  They were quite adamant, they didn't want to listen to me, they just kept on attacking me and the comrades with whom I operated, were outside the house.\n\tThey heard some screams and struggle from the house.  They wanted to take the hand grenade which was in my hand, somebody stabbed me with a fork on the right hand, so that I could release the hand grenade.\n\tAs they were stabbing me with the fork, the safety pin of the hand grenade was mistakenly released.  I told them that the safety pin had been released, and they had to give me a chance to put it back so that it could not explode.  I kept on trying to explain to them, that they had called me to come and explain and what I had gone there for, was to explain as to why they had to switch off the lights.\n\tDuring the struggle, the comrades kicked the door open, that is how I got a chance to escape.  My right hand was bleeding.  It happened that I was injured and I got angry at that time, especially because I had not gone there to fight or attack.  I told myself that I am not going to compromise, let me just give them the present that they wanted because they were obstacles standing in our way, and we did not want people who were going to disturb us, especially with regard to our duty to protect the community.\n\tSo they had to accept the present that I was giving to them.
