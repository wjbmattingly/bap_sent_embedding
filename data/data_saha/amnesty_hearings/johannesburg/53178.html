<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is he applying for?</p>

<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> When did you join the SDUs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> I joined in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Who was your Commander in Mlungeni Section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> It was Vusi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> When the previous applicant, that is Mr Motjale testified, you were seated inside this room, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> Very true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> He mentioned an incident relating to kidnapping one Qobani and taking him to Polla Park and in his testimony he mentioned that you were one of the people who participated in this incident.  Do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> You heard his testimony relating to this particular incident.  Do you agree with what he has told this Committee or is there anything that you believe he has left out that you wish to mention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> The way he said it, I do concur with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you able to give us dates, he was unable to?  Perhaps your memory serves you better?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> I have no recollection of the dates as well, but it was around September, because it was right towards December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> With the incident in Polla Park, did you associate yourself fully with what happened there to the victim, Qobani, I mean relating to his kidnapping, assault, attempted murder and pointing a firearm at him?  Can you say today that you are disassociating yourself to any of those things that happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> I concur with the version of the former applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> So you are associating yourself with what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> And the incident that took place at the house, 2192  Xaba Street, what role did you play there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> I had in my possession a palm gun, self made gun, we shattered the windows, that is what I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>	As to enter into the house, I did not, I was always, all the time, outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You went there in order to facilitate the killing of the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> I think if we were able to drag him to the outside, I think I would have played an active role.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, but in other words you associated yourself with whatever occurred inside the house also, even though you never went into the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were one of three people that went to that house with an order to kill the victim, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You armed yourself for that purpose essentially?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That you didn't get into the house, made no difference to the plan to which you were party, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And therefore you associated yourself with the activities or actions of your two colleagues as it occurred inside that house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Xumalo, these two incidents as they were told by your colleague, Mr Motjale, do you agree with everything that he has said or is there anything else that you would wish to add that you regard as of importance that the Committee should know about, relating to these two incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> There is nothing he left.  I believe what he said is exactly as it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Do you have anything else that does not relate to Mr Motjale, that you - an incident that only you were involved, that you wish to put before this Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> As you were sitting in the room and I believe you heard that a meeting will be facilitated between the victim and Mr Motjale, do you also wish to be part of that meeting in order to facilitate good relations between yourself and the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MRS NHLAYISI</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That meeting goes further than personal relations, do you realise that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> I did not hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That meeting in an attempt to facilitate good relations, goes further than merely personal relationships, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It goes much further, because it is an attempt to restore the fabric of society, not because you know each other, it is a bringing together of human beings as we should have been living all these years, and haven't been given the opportunity to do so,do you understand that?That is how important that meeting is.You are willing to attend such a meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR XUMALO:</span> Yes, I am willing and prepared.</p>

<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In your case also, I want to ask one or two questions.   Would you agree that what has happened in the past especially in your area, if we look back on it now, it should not have happened?  Not only your incident, but the general problem in the area?
