Madam Chair, I think even the applicant must have a sense that he has fallen far short of adeucing evidence to satisfy this Committee that he should be granted amnesty for these particular acts.\n\tIf I may just highlight three areas.  His affiliation to the PAC, I submit with respect has not been supported by the evidence that he gave.  It is clear that the acts occurred after the election which was a momentous occasion of international renown and for the applicant to simply say that well, he was a new recruit and he didn't quite understand the aims and objectives of the PAC as it stood for at that stage, I submit cannot be accepted as being true.  Even if he was a supporter of the PAC and given his evidence that his family was a long line of PAC supporters, he would have been aware and as I submit, a lot of the black youth at that time were politically aware of what their various political parties were driving at.  The fact that he doesn't participate in the election, the fact that he is oblivious to the aims and the objectives of the PAC, I submit must raise a very serious question as to his truthfulness on this aspect.\n\tI submit his amnesty application just then doesn't make sense because he says he committed these acts to further the aims of the PAC as stated in his amnesty application and frankly, Madam Chair, his evidence is poles apart and one just has difficulty trying to reconcile his evidence today that he was a new recruit and wasn't aware and what is stated in his amnesty application.\n\tWe also have his concessions that he could not other than concede that he'd lied during his trial at least three occasions, obviously to try and extricate himself from the position that he was in.  I think that at the end of the day we haven't had full disclosure.  In fact I think a serious question is raised whether this in fact was a political matter and I would urge this Committee, I would argue that it hasn't been proven, it hasn't been established at least on a balance of probabilities that this was a political act or act associated with a political objective.  Thank you Madam Chair.",
