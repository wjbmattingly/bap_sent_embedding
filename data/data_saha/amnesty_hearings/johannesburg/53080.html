<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can call your next witness, we will deal with his evidence-in-chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I call Lucky Richard Molahlehi, application number 7098/97 and it's on page 111 ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Molahlehi, what language would you like to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Lucky Molahlehi, that is my name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What language would you like to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> I'd use South Sesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As you wish.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> We are requesting a minute, Sir.  The interpreters did not hear your question, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">LUCKY RICHARD MOLAHLEHI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Mr Chairman, before I start, may I have leave to amend the list that I'd handed up to you this morning, recording the specific details about Lucky Molahleni's offences?  It has been listed as attempted murder only.  May I have leave to increase that list by adding possession of an AK47 and possession of an R4 rifle?  It all relates to the same incident at the same time.  May I proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SAMUELS:</span> Mr Molahleni, how old are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> 27 years old, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And you belong to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Do you live in Thokoza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And were you a Self Defence Unit member in Thokoza during the early 90's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And who was your commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Mr Xnube.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I see.  You are applying for amnesty for three offences, attempted murder, possession of AK47 and possession of an R4, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you perhaps in his application itself, from page 111, show us where he mentions any of these offences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> No, it's not mentioned specifically.  On page 113, 112, in answer to the question: Furnish sufficient particulars of any acts, he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>"General defence of the community against the IFP."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>My submission is that at the time when these applications were filled in, not all the applicants were ad idem on what it is that they were going to specifically write in each application.  There had been - and it may be viewed incorrectly that a policy decision was taken on how to fill in these forms and on that reason my submission is, there will logically be a difference between what the applicant will be saying now in oral testimony as opposed to that paragraph A(1).  </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>	I appreciate that can be argued on a matter of inconsistency and therefore can be rejected as evidence.  My argument would be that a general phrase was written and it is only now that the specifics are available, that we have tried to hand them up.  I understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see the problem that we face, and I think you're going to have to argue this very strongly, is that when they say "in general defence of the community", that in itself is not a crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And hence the question, how does the application fit in here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Yes, again my only submission is, it was a general policy decision taken not by this specific applicant, by his political party, that these forms will be filled in in a certain way.  And in fact this also reflects on our previous difficulties of wanting to lead previous witnesses and history and the manner in which the hearings would have been held.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>	My submission is that the specific acts that the applicant will now testify to, or the general defence of the community encompasses those specific acts, being defending his community against marchers along a certain street.  I would submit that his specific acts that he will tell us about now can be included within that very, very general phrase, "general defence of the community."  That is my only submission on that point.  If you wish us to argue on ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I think let me allow you to lead the evidence, with the rider that I'm not particularly convinced that this is a proper application at this stage.  Perhaps you will at the end persuade us all that is okay, and we will wait till then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Okay, thank you.  May I continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Only for the record, Ms Patel, were particulars asked at a certain stage and where they supplied, when and so on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> If you grant me a moment I will double-check.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr Samuels, I just want to clear one thing.  I just want the correct spelling of his surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Are you Molahlehi or Molahleni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> That is Molahlehi, H-I at the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry, M-O-L?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> M-O-L-O-L-A-H-I, H-L-E-H-I, Molahlehi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> You have applied for amnesty for the attempted murder of IFP marchers, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> When did this incident occur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> It was late 1992, towards the end of 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And in which street did this incident occur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Schoeman Road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And where about is that, in which neighbourhood?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> It is between Unit F and Buyafuti hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Now describe in your own words what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> What happened that day, the Inkatha marchers were singing from the hostel.  Because we were afraid that when they come back they will come and attack us we went into Unit F so that we could see the direction that they were taking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>	When we arrived there, we saw them moving towards our houses, so we tried to stop them.  While trying to stop them we were armed with AK47s as members of the ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were you trying to stop them from doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> It is known that whenever they march, when they come back they will kill people and we didn't want them to reach our places because we knew that they would attack us.  That's why we stopped them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>	So the shootout ensued because they were also shooting at us and we were also shooting at them.  They were accompanied by the Stability Unit.  This unit was also helping them to shoot us until we surrendered because we realised that they were being helped by the Stability Unit.  Then we ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>	During that incident one member of Inkatha was in the front.  During that shootout he fell.  He had an R4.  So I had a chance to go and take that R4 and then I took that R4 and ran away with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Where is that R4 now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> When we were told to hand our hand over our weapons after the elections, I returned that R4, I handed it over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Who did you give it to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> I didn't give it to a specific person, we just handed them over at the stadium.  We didn't know where they were taken to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Now you said that when the IFP marchers were coming along Schoeman Street, you were shooting in their direction, how far away did you stand from these marchers, approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> It could be about 100 metres from where I was standing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I see.  And the AK47 that you had in your possession, did you know that it was illegal to have an Ak47 in your possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Yes, I did, but because of the situation then, I was forced to have it in my possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And did you also know that to hold the R4 was unlawful, illegal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I see, thank you.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SAMUELS</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know if anybody was killed or injured during that event?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> No, Chairperson, I don't know of any person that was injured or killed during that shoot-out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry, but didn't you tell us about somebody, and you in fact took his R4 or was that not on that occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> That's correct, he was injured but I don't know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's what I asked, if anybody was injured or killed.  ...(inaudible) the name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Yes, I agree that people got injured because we were fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we'll break for the lunch adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> That is the applicant's evidence-in-chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I have a few questions.  I just want to clarify something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>	Sir, you were present when the previous applicant gave evidence about a shooting at a funeral which proceeded down Schoeman Street, do you recall that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I think it's the same applicant.  He testified about a shooting down Schoeman Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Indeed Sir, but the previous applicant also testified about a shooting down Schoeman Street, near the tennis courts, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he say Schoeman Street?  I'm not too sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> If my memory serves me correctly, I'm just trying to ascertain whether we are talking about the same event.  If not, I will ...  Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>	Shall I repeat the question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> You were present when the previous applicant testified about a shooting that occurred at a funeral march down Schoeman Street, and if my memory serves me correctly, he specifically mentioned near the tennis courts and he also mentioned people shooting from houses, do you recall that testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Yes, I remember, but it's not the same incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Alright.  I'll leave that there then ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Schoeman Street seems to be a war zone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Apparently so, Sir, also very close to the cemetery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>	Let me ask you this.  When the person at the front of the march fell, did he fall because he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Can you repeat the question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> When the person at the front of the march, the person whose R4 rifle you took fell, did he fall because he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> I believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> And did you see where he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> I have nothing further, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SWANEPOEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Patel, have you got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:</span> Yes, just one aspect I'd like clarity on, Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>	Mr Molahlehi, can you recall at the start of the incident where the first shots came from?  Did you act in response to shots being fired upon you or were  you the aggressors in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> They started shooting and then we responded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Are you saying then that you acted in self defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you, Honourable Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were any people on your side injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was there a lot of gunfire from the other side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Anybody injured on your side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> No person on our side was injured because we had a place where we shielded ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you were not openly confronting each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> We were confronting each other but we took cover.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were you taking cover in houses, or where did you take cover?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> We were outside the houses but inside the yard.  We used the whole fences of those houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When you ran out to take the R4, were they still shooting at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Yes, they were shooting at that time.  The person who was leading the march was near me, that is why I was able to go and take that R5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> How far from you did he fall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLAHLEHI:</span> Approximately 40 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> No re-examination, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR SWANEPOEL</p>

We have since traced him and I would now like to call Parry Dlamini to the witness stand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Mr Chairperson, if I may.  I have in the meantime taken instructions from the victims whom I represent in this matter.  Maybe this is a convenient time to finish the cross-examination of Mr Xaba and then proceed with ...(intervention)</p>

<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> I have one or two questions, depending on the answers, Mr Chair.  As you please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We recall Mr Xaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>	Mr Xaba, you are still under oath to speak the truth, do you understand?  Has he heard that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">THEMBA RICHARD XABA:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Swanepoel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>	Mr Xaba, do I understand your evidence correctly to be that you based your assumption that only Mr Msizi was in the house, on information that you received from people who watched the house for you in the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> Yes, I've said so.  We were sure that it was only Mr Msizi and his children were not there, and his wife wasn't there, we confirmed this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words, you only make application in respect of an attempt to murder Mr Msizi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> Yes, he was an IFP member and a leader.  We wanted him to resign.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Now, I have taken instructions, and Mr Msizi will come and testify if necessary, but my instructions are that his whole family was in the house that evening when you threw the petrol bomb into the house, what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> I'm certain his family wasn't inside the house.  It's a lie that his family was inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you said you relied on the information of your informants, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> I said like that and I also said that I took it my job to make sure that Msizi was alone and his family wasn't inside the house.  When he came at ten to nine he was alone, his family wasn't there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Xaba, I don't want to sound rude but you've told us this so you don't have to repeat it.  We don't want to hear a long version.  All I'm asking is simply, that as I understand your evidence thusfar, that you had people watching the house and prior to your throwing or the group throwing that petrol bomb into the Msizi house, your information from those people who were watching that house was that Mr Msizi took his family away and returned alone, and consequently you drew the conclusion that when you threw or when your group threw that petrol bomb into the house, Mr Msizi was there alone, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> Yes, you are correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now if your informants were incorrect or they were wrong or they lied to you, you wouldn't know, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And therefore it was put to you that you would not be able to dispute in those circumstances, if Mr Msizi were to come and testify that he and his family were indeed in the house when that petrol bomb was thrown into it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> Let me just explain this this way.  I came 15 minutes before we did what we did and when Msizi came into his house I was outside his house, and he was alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but his family may have been inside the house.  I'm not saying, and I don't think the advocate is suggesting that your honest belief may have been that Mr Msizi was alone, but the factual issue may have been otherwise, would you not agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> I do agree that probably there may have been other people in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>	Now let me understand your complaint against Mr Msizi correctly, is your only complaint that he was an IFP member and a council member and that he was opposed to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think that was - his complaint was initially, you may get other answers now, but he was councillor whose activities didn't favour the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>	Let me rephrase my question.  Did you ever see Mr Msizi attack the community or being involved in crimes against the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> ...(no English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you better be very careful, to define what you mean by crime to the witness.  What you and I may regard as common law crimes or statutory crimes, there are other crimes which are moral, which the witness may refer to as crimes.  They've always being doing so in political talk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>	I'll rephrase to state: did you ever see Mr Msizi involved in attacks against the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> No, I haven't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> So when you say that the reason for you committing the offence, in your application on page 70 of the bundle, is</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>"General defence of the community."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>the word "defence" is not strictly speaking correct, is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's precisely what I was getting to, Mr Swanepoel.  I don't want to put words into the witness's mouth but I have come across interpretations of offences by victims, for example corruption, taking away their homes for whatever reason, manipulating a list of people who are waiting to be allocated houses, that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>	Strictly speaking that may not be crime as we understand it, but there have been applications that I've come across, where people refer to those kind of activities as crimes and defending the community against such activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair, I'll leave that aspect for argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>	One final question, Mr Xaba.  Could you just refresh my memory, who exactly was with you when the attack was launched?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> It was Perry Dlamini, Bafana Baloi and Jacky Macheo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> I have no further questions, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SWANEPOEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You testified that you prepared the petrol bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When were those bombs prepared?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> Before  we went and attacked Mr Msizi's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, how long before, an hour before or two hours before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> We prepared these from 6 o'clock and the attack took place at 9 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And when did you start - you said you went to the house, I couldn't catch it, was it 50 minutes, 50, or 15 before the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> 15 minutes before the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And you didn't look into the house at that stage, through a window or a door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> Msizi's house used to have policemen all the time and it was not easy for one to look through the windows or the doors because of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Ja, but we know that there were no policemen on that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> I'm talking about 9 o'clock, and these people changed shifts, so the other group left and the other group was about to come.  It was not easy for us to enter, to actually enter Msizi's house but we could see from a distance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When did the police leave, the first shift?  Did you see them leaving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> Yes, we saw the police leaving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And after they left, didn't you go up to the window to look who is there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> No, Msizi was there and he was our only target.  We were not worried about others.  As soon as the police left, we attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you don't know whether there were others in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> As I have mentioned, we were sure that Msizi's family had already gone and he came back alone and the police had gone already, so we were sure that he was alone.  We didn't know that there were other people whom we don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And how long before the attack did the police go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> It took us three minutes.  As soon as the police left, we attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr Xaba, you said after you hurled these petrol bombs you ran away, did I hear you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> Yes, we ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Do you know what damage was done to Mr Msizi's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> I saw the damage the following day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> How much was the damage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> Now if you're talking about monetary, I wouldn't know but it was damaged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> I mean how were the walls damaged or what burnt because of the petrol bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR XABA:</span> The roof was damaged but the walls were still there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I have no further questions, Mr Chairman.  May the witness be excused?  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
