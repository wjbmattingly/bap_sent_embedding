Four of the youngsters died and Mr Lingani's other son, Jefferson, was immediately linked to the abductions and shootings.  Reprisal were swift, the following night Jefferson's house and another next to it were fire bombed, causing extensive damage.  Later a bus was driven into the ruins to complete the effect.  Jefferson was arrested to answer a number of allegations including murder.  He was granted bail but has since disappeared and speculation is that he has left the country.  A warrant for his arrest is held.  His house was near the homes of the youngsters who had been abducted and shot.  It is in this neighbourhood where a well known former Soweto Student, Mr (indistinct) was also lived\".  In Mr Lingani's killing, revenge was the most likely motive.  His abductors were looking for Jefferson and not finding him decided on a member of his family.  \"And over the past months ...\" that is a quotation, \"... over the past months we received telephone calls threatening us to expect anything\".
