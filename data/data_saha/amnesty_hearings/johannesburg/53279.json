Somehow this was not mentioned by the applicant in his affidavit, he safely only mentioned the fact that they ordered a firearm.  I would like to regard that, to consider that as well.\n\tFurther, Mr Chair and Honourable Members of the Committee, the applicant spoke about the fact that, or in his affidavit he states that the deceased lifted up his firearm with an intention to shoot at him.  And it's been the evidence of the witness, which I would like the Committee to consider as the true evidence that the deceased did not lift any firearm.  Actually the applicant also admits to the fact that the deceased never lifted up a firearm.  \n\tIt's also the evidence of the witness that the situation of the firearm on the deceased's body was not visible to anybody who would have been outside, more especially to the friend of the applicant who was seated at the left-hand side.  And it appears that the firearm was not visible.\n\tFurther, Mr Chair, on the argument of the motive for having killed the deceased, I would like to argue that if the applicant says he had no intentions to kill, then we wouldn't be talking about murder here, we would talk about culpable homicide, because then he would be arguing that he was killed by mistake, it was negligent killing and that doesn't amount to murder, it amounts to culpable homicide.\n\tIt's my submission, Mr Chair, that the applicant's motive was criminal inasfar as the shooting of the deceased was concerned.  Thank you, Mr Chair.  I don't know whether you would like me to address you on any issue or aspect.",
