The factthat the South African Police was used in such a way made quitea difference in the training techniques.  The police had to beable to also combat guerillas and take part in a military war. This included all elements of combat, guerilla warfare and counter-insurgencyactivities.  It also included training to kill, self-defence andmilitary tactics.  It also included training relating to interrogationof terrorists and planning of military operations.\n The ANC/SACP alliance during the 1970's further started a full-scaleguerilla war against the Republic of South Africa.  The populationwere indoctrinated to believe that there was a full-scale waragainst the Republic of South Africa.  The way in which the guerillawar developed showed that this was a correct view of the situation. The ANC/SACP alliance was supported by the Eastern block countriesand specifically the USSR.",

            "During these riots there were many casesof incitement, damage to property, bombing and shooting.  Manyinnocent civilians suffered as a result.  I was not involved inany of these riots at this time and I was therefore not involvedin any cases where activists were killed or dealt with in anyother way.  I was also not directly not involved in the interrogationof activists.  At that stage I was second in command of the securitybranch in Springs.\n The events took place a long time ago.  My memory is not so goodanymore.  I can't remember specific events which took place duringthat time in which I was involved or which I ordered.  The UnitedDemocratic Front was established in 1983 and from 1983 they wagedfullscale guerilla war.  This was done by the internal wing ofthe ANC, namely the UDF, until approximately 1989.  The situationwas that there was a fullscale war which included death, tortureand other actions committed by activists as set out above in respectof the Soweto riots.  \n The South African government's approach was that there was atotal onslaught against the country at all levels and that wereinvolved in war. Security legislation was promulgated and otheremergency measures instituted.  This happened in 1985, at thestart of '85 and it was made permanent in June 1986.  During thisconflict South Africa was infiltrated by activists of the ANC/SACPalliance as well as the PAC.  These activists continued to tryand make the country ungovernable.  All the acts were aimed at\n1B destabilising/...\n134 BRIG CRONJE\ndestabilising the country.  Actions committed by them includednecklace murders, ordinary murders, assaults, robbery, arson,damage to property, intimidation, the organising of school boycottsand consumer boycotts, bombings and stonings.  These actions hadto be countered by the South African Police. \n The South African Police were forced at that stage to act ina way which was not in line with normal conduct in times of peace. It was necessary to institute counter measures against the actionsof the activists and therefore to act outside normal policingchannels as well as outside the confines of the legal system. The nature of the events as they escalated therefore led to ablurring of the distinction between lawful actions and objectives. It was necessary, sanctioned and approved that the South AfricanPolice use methods and act in ways which would not be acceptablein normal peace times.\n The training of the South African Police also had to be adaptedto focus more on the military component of training as it wasnecessary for the daily functioning of the South African Police. This was especially applicable to people involved in the securitybranch of the South African Police.  The ultimate result was thatduring the period of 1983 to '89 was that there was in realitya fullscale, almost a conventional war in South Africa and thattechniques and actions were based on military models, militarystyle operations were performed and actions of a military naturewere undertaken by the SAP.  Use was further made of informersand agents relating to the gathering of information and the conveyingof such information.  Espionage was the order of the day.\n1B violations/...\n135 BRIG CRONJE\nFrom the above it is clear that there were gross \nviolations of human rights on both sides of the spectrum.  Onthe side of the ANC/SACP alliance, as well as the PAC the well-knownexamples of the necklace murders, consumer boycotts, school boycotts,strikes, arson, group murders, uprisings and riots in generalcan be clearly recalled by anyone who lived in South Africa during1983 to 1989.  \n It was also so that members of the South African Police, duringthat period had to be indoctrinated and to be persuaded that whathad to be done in the circumstances had to be done with one objectivenamely to protect and maintain the State and the National Partyso that the State would not be overthrown by the liberation movementsand to combat the onslaught of the ANC/SACP and PAC and otherliberation movements against the South African government. \n Normal policing functions, therefore, took a back seat in thesecircumstances.  It was especially members of the security policewho were involved in operations and this was necessitated by virtueof the situation of war.  It was also expected of them to formthe backbone of the attack against the ANC/SACP and PAC.  Thesecurity police were in the crossfire of this war and acted like,for instance, select units and battalions in the Namibian bushwar.  A good example of this is for instance 32 battalion, specialforces and Koevoet as far as the police was concerned. \n The security police in the Republic of South Africa found themselvesin exactly the same situation.  It was the security police whohad to counter the infiltration of terrorists and activists andwho had to combat the actions of terrorists and activists.  Forthat reason it was that members of the security police were mostinvolved in \n1B multiple/...\n136 BRIG CRONJE\nmultiple violations of human rights necessitated by the circumstancesand by virtue of the situation of war which existed.\n A distinction cannot be drawn between a conventional war anda guerilla war which was waged by the ANC/SACP and PAC in theRepublic of South Africa in that time.  It was only the methodsof warfare which differed but it cannot be denied that guerillawarfare was nothing other than just a different form of warfare.\n In the light of the above it was therefore necessary to eliminateinsurgents, terrorists and activists where the circumstances justifiedit.  If such persons were not eliminated in these circumstancesthey would not be permanently neutralised by way of the securitylegislation, detention and by means of normal legal procedures. The legal system was simply not equipped or able to deal withthese situations and to counter the soldiers of the ANC, SACPand PAC.  The struggle had to be waged on a military level, asa war, and for that reason the elimination of terrorists and activistswere seen as justified and were regarded as part of the struggle.\n There were active steps taken to prevent the killing of innocentpeople, so we acted in a preventive way.  If only the acts ofthe ANC, SACP and PAC activists and terrorists are taken intoconsideration one can come to no other conclusion than that therewas a fullscale war in the country.  Acts included, amongst others,various bomb explosions such as a motor car bomb in Church Street,Pretoria, various other car bomb explosions, limpet mine explosionsand incidences of sabotage, landmine explosions, murder and otheracts of terror.

Due to the structureof the SAP at that stage Brigadier Victor was my senior and Iwould have been compelled to accept orders and instructions fromhim.  He told me that he had called in Captain Jacque Hechterand gave him the instruction, along with his son, this son ofhis was a lieutenant at the time, and stationed at Mamelodi, tobring the riots in Pretoria under control.  It didn't matter howit was done and what was done.  He said that Pretoria was burningand that South Africa was burning.  He said that all necessarysteps should be taken to normalise the situation and bring itunder control.  He further said that if a policeman's house wasattacked immediate steps had to be \n2A taken/...\n142 BRIG CRONJE\ntaken against the person who was responsible for that act.  Sucha person's house would then have to be burnt down as well.  Hisorders were to the effect that when we retaliated we should justgo a step further than the enemy each time.  His instructionsamounted to the security police taking active steps in the struggleagainst terrorists and activists.  What his orders in realityamounted to was that the same methods had to be used and thatthere was in reality an active guerilla war to be waged againstthe ANC, SACP and PAC activists as well as activists from otherliberation organisations.\n Before Brigadier Victor's command the security police acted ina reactionary way only, and this meant that activists responsiblefor offences and other acts aimed at destabilising the countrywere arrested and dealt with in terms of the existing legislation,including security legislation.  At the stage of Brigadier Victor'scommand it was clear that reactionary conduct was not sufficientto stem the tide of riots, violence and destabilisation.  At thatstage a fullscale war was entered upon.  \n In terms of Brigadier Victor's command, from that stage onwardsuse was made of guerilla warfare tactics and a fullscale guerillawar was waged against the liberation organisations.  It was ofa pro-active nature to prevent acts of terror and to neutraliseactivists before they could commit acts of terror rather thanmerely to react to acts of terror.\n I accepted that this instruction by Brigadier Victor had comefrom a higher authority.  I informed Brigadier Victor that I wouldmake staff available to his son and Captain Hechter in order toact in such a manner.  As far as 2A I/...\n143 BRIG CRONJE\nI know this same procedure was followed in all the other divisionsof the security police throughout the country.  It's a generallyaccepted way of action and it was never repudiated or addressedby either Head Office, the Commissioner of Police, the State SecurityCouncil, the Cabinet or the government.  As far as I understoodit and I continue to be convinced of this the change to pro-activeaction against the liberation movements was done with the authorisationof the government of the day.  \n All actions under my jurisdiction which happened in this mannerwere taken up in situation reports which were sent through ona daily basis to my head office.  The procedure was that furtherreports with this information would then have been passed on tothe State Security Council.  Events which took place under mycommand in the Security Branch in Pretoria was, therefore, passedonto Head Office and must have been taken up in reports to theState Security Council.  \n I must mention Chair that every morning an information reportwas sent through to Head Office.  Every incident of the previousday was mentioned in this report, such as for instance I maintainedfiles on activists, the same file was kept at the Head Office,if an activist, therefore, was killed on a particular day or hishouse was burnt down, that information would have been passedon to Head Office with a file reference and the instructions,the events and the information would have been discussed at ameeting of all the heads at security head office.

They must have known what the truefacts were.\n There were monthly meetings at the Joint Control Centre wherethese incidents were discussed.

Such eliminationhappened generally with regard to persons of high profile or veryeffective activists whose arrest could have led to momentum inthe freedom struggle.

Actions against activists andterrorists created the impression that South Africa was involvedin a struggle for life and death.

As soonas it was known that a particular activist had been arrested andthat information was obtained it would have made the interrogationprocess useless in the sense that this information would haveserved - Let me state this differently, if this information cameout then the persons who dealt with this person would have changedtheir plans terrorists in safe houses would have escaped and wewould have had no opportunity to find them. \n The identity of informants and sources of security police hadto be protected.  A person would immediately have known who hadbetrayed him to the security police and that person's life wouldthen have been worth nothing.  \n Where activists in training within or outside the country wherethey intended to go for training they had to be eliminated toprevent them from destabilising the country through acts of terrorismsuch as bombing attacks on security forces as well as soft targets. As soon as an activist had been trained he was in a differentclass to normal activists and his knowledge and skills were thenequal to that of the security police and he would have been \n2B far/...\n167 BRIG CRONJE\nfar more effective in military operations.  \n All of these, therefore, led to the continued government by theNational Party and the successful combatting of communism.",

So you will find this explanation of Brigadier Cronje also hasa part of the explanation pertaining to the political motive inCaptain Hechter's application, in Warrant Officer van Vuuren'sapplication and the other applications.  It does not mean thatthat is the only motivation.  In each incident there will be aspecific further motivation pertaining to the specific facts ofthat incident.

If activists became too well-known or militant or veryeffectively encouraged the consciousness of freedom or for freedomof a particular community they would necessarily have receiveda bomb and their supporters would have had a strong intuitionwith regard to the source of the bomb.

We simply tried to make the applications as wideand as detailed as possible.",

            "During this event Colonel Jack Cronje wasthe commander at Vlakplaas.  I was directly under his commandand control.  A number of members of Vlakplaas were given theinstruction to go to the Eastern Cape particularly Port Elizabethsince the politically related unrest was taking place there andour help was needed with the suppression of the unrest.  We wereinstructed to take along a group of askaris, former members ofUmkhonto we Sizwe and SAP members 3B to/...\n189 COL VENTER\nto identify possible infiltrators.  When we as members of Vlakplaaswere sent to other regions we were placed under the command ofthe regional commander and received direct instructions from theregions' offices.  I remember that the following Vlakplaas memberswent along, namely Gert Beslaar, Joe Mamasela, Johannes Kule,Piet Mogwayo, Peggy Radebe and other Black members whose namesI no longer remember.  In the early hours of the morning we arrivedin Port Elizabeth and went to the railway station to Glen Connorwhere we stayed in a house.  We rode patrol and I attempted toidentify possible infiltrators, activists and incitists to findthem and gain information.  As we found and arrested these activistswe handed them over to the local security branch for further action. There were daily consultations with the members of the Port Elizabethsecurity branch.  The purpose was to assist the security branchthere with the finding of trained terrorists and activists whowere fleeing from them and who were responsible for the unrestin the area.  \n The security branch in Port Elizabeth gained information thatthree activists who were specifically looked for with regard topolitical unrest and destabilisation in the area would have goneto the airport that particular night.  At that time the entirecountry was alight and there was unrest everywhere, arson, sabotage,incitement, school boycotts, consumer boycotts, necklacing murdersand other kinds of intimidation.  I was asked to go along withthe askaris to the airport to pick up the three men.  We werenot known in the area and therefore were able to act with easewithout causing suspicion.  Captain Sakkie van Zyl of the securitybranch came along with me and the \n3B askaris/...\n190 COL VENTER\naskaris.  The information available to us were that they wereANC activists involved in unrest in that area.  The purpose ofthe operation was to interrogate them, gain information, removethem out of the area and neutralise their involvement.  I didnot know at that time that there had been a decision that theywere to be eliminated by being killed.  We drove to the airportwith a Nissan Safari.  Joe Mamasela, Kule, Magwayo and Radebefollowed in a minibus.  Lieutenant Dion Nieuwoudt also went along. I think at that time he was a warrant officer.\n We were shown photographs of the activists and knew exactly whatthey looked like.  The askaris easily picked them up at the airportand took them away with a combi to the agreed meeting place alongthe ocean.  Dion Nieuwoudt and another person, whose name I cannotremember removed the vehicle of the three persons, it was a bakkie. Myself, Sakkie van Zyl and Gert Beslaar met the group of askarisat a later stage at the agreed place next to the ocean.  The threeactivists were at this meeting.  They had caps over their headswhich were entirely covered.  Myself and Warrant Officer Beslaarleft everyone there and went back to our residence at Glen Connor. It had been requested that my askaris were to assist the branchwith regard to further interrogation and investigation and I leftthem there under the command of Sakkie van Zyl.  \n Sakkie van Zyl before we left asked me to return to them, orrather to meet with them in Cradock a day or two later.  I donot remember why the interrogation took place at Cradock but acceptedthat the purpose was that they were to be kept outside of thearea where they operated.  I was going to Cradock in any eventsince I was visiting all the \n3B security/...\n191 COL VENTER\nsecurity branches in the area.  The commander at Cradock was totake me to Van Zyl where I was also to meet with my askaris andregain command over them.  \n A day or two later we went to Cradock where Major Winter, thecommander of the Cradock security branch took us to the placewhere the three captives were.  It was an old police station inthe Cradock area.  I will not be able to identify this place againtoday.  At this old police station was present Sakkie van Zyl,Dion Nieuwoudt, the already mentioned askaris and Major Winterwho took us to this place.  Gert Beslaar had gone along with me. I cannot remember the names of other persons there present. The only persons whom I know and remember at that event was DionNieuwoudt, Sakkie van Zyl and Major Winter.  \n We had a barbecue and had some drinks and the three captiveswere with us but their faces were covered so they were not ableto see us.  I could see them and it had not appeared if they werein any way harmed, or in an evident way harmed. Dion Nieuwoudtor Sakkie van Zyl told me that the investigation or interrogationhad gone well and that much information had been gained.  I didnot take part in the interrogations but gathered that the threewere later to be eliminated since their bakkie had already beendestroyed.   Later that evening I went along with Beslaar backto Glen Connor and the Vlakplaas askaris joined us that eveningor the next morning at Glen Connor.  I was not involved in theinterrogation of the three persons nor was I involved in any assaultsor intimidation or any other action against these three persons. I was also not involved in the removal of the bakkie.\n I am not entirely sure what happened to these three \n3B persons/...\n192 COL VENTER\npersons nor did I hear afterwards what had happened to them. Someone whose name I cannot remember informed me that their bakkiehad been burnt out.  This is the same bakkie that Nieuwoudt hadremoved from the airport.\n The three mentioned activists were the great troublemakers atthat stage in the Eastern Cape.  The entire operation was aimedat removing these three from the area and to neutralise them. I do not remember that an instruction had been given that theywere to be killed.  \n I do, however, know that from time to time that activists andterrorists responsible for serious crimes, the death of otherpersons, assaults, intimidation and the death of innocent civilianswere eliminated and then disappeared.  It was necessary to eliminateactivists of such stature since if they were to be kept in detentionthey would have become an increasing risk since they would havemartyrs for their people.  \n Sakkie van Zyl, then a captain of the security branch in theEastern Cape was under the direct command of the currently retiredGeneral Nick van Rensburg.  Sakkie van Zyl's instructions musthave come from General Nick van Rensburg who was at that timeeither a Brigadier or Colonel and who was then head of the securitybranch in the Eastern Cape.",

            "Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Mpshe and myselfhave, as I have told you, decided that we won't go ahead withColonel Venter and that for purposes of the speaker of the NorthwestParliament if you give permission that we can go ahead with furtherevidence we would like to deal with one specific incident relatingto Mr Tebedi.  I beg your pardon she reminds me that they haveto make their submissions, I forgot about that, I am sorry.\nMS HARTEL ADDRESSES COMMITTEE\n Mr Chairman, honoured members of the Committee the families ofthe Pepco 3 have some idea of what happened to their loved ones,from revelations outside this Commission which they have beenunable to test.  They know that they were abducted, tortured andmurdered at the hands of the police.  They had hoped, however,to establish today from Venter's submissions and testimony thefiner details of what exactly happened on that day, who the responsibleperpetrators are and most importantly where the bodies are.  The families have brought three applications since the fatefulday when their loved ones disappeared for the police to producethem to the Court.  In every one of those \n4B applications/...\n223 ADDRESS\napplications the police vehemently denied that the men were arrestedor detained.  \n The families want only to establish who committed these grossviolations and to find the bodies so that they can give theirloved ones a proper burial and put the matter to rest.  This isafter all the whole purpose of the Truth and Reconciliation Commissionto establish the whole truth so that reconciliation and reconstructioncan be advanced. \n When an amnesty applicant fails to make a full disclosure ofall relevant facts we submit, with respect, that such applicationmust fail.  Venter's submissions are disappointing to say theleast.  His application for amnesty is limited to acts, omissionsor offences which he describes as abduction, malicious injuryto property, theft, other minor offences associated therewithand any other offences which may appear from his submissions orthe facts to which he has deposed.  He has added murder, but wewould submit, with respect,  that  it doesn't take the matterany further as the facts to which he has deposed does not discloseor make out any case of murder or even an association with murder.\n The application is lacking in material detail such as an absencein response to the question, at page 114 of Venter's submissions,in response to the question 10A \"Mention political purposes\",no response is noted.  It also fails even to identify the Pepco3 as victims and I refer in this regard to page 113 of Venter'ssubmissions, where the response to all the questions regardingwho the victims are, their names and addresses and other informationwhich would assist this Committee in identifying them, the answeris \"onbekend\" \"unknown\" \"no informationto assist\".\n4B We/...\n224 ADDRESS\n We would submit for this reason alone the application shouldfail for want of proper compliance with the requirements of theAct.\n It is the families' contention further that Venter's applicationfor indemnity is disingenuous as he does not even begin to acknowledgehis complicity in acts which amount to gross violations of humanrights.  In fact Venter has made every effort to disassociatehimself with the crux of the matter which is the death of thePepco 3 activists.  He denies that he had any part in the interrogationof the three or assaulting them or intimidating them.  He evengoes further and denies that they had suffered any injuries whichwere obvious to the eye.  He denies that he has knowledge of anyother acts committed in relation to them.  He has no knowledgeof the fate of the yellow bakkie which conveyed them to the airport. And he bears no personal knowledge of their eventual fate.\n Mr Chair one is at a loss to understand the purpose of his applicationfor indemnity.  Venter has not furnished this Committee with anyinformation in addition to the revelations made by the Vlakplaasoperatives outside of this Commission.  In fact he's not evenassociated himself with the allegations made by these operatives. He has only detracted therefrom. \n It is inconceivable, given the public knowledge of the Vlakplaas,of the agenda during the period in question, that they would haveinvolved themselves in the affairs of the Eastern Cape in relationto the three for any purpose other than to permanently eliminatethem.  \n I submit further that Venter has failed to assist this Committeein identifying any key perpetrators in respect of \n4B the/...\n225 ADDRESS\nthe atrocities and in all the circumstances we respectfully submitthat he has failed to take this Commission into its confidence,and he must therefore not be rewarded with amnesty in respectof any acts of violence committed against the Pepco 3 activists.\n Those are my submissions Mr Chairman.",

Mr Chairman I wanted to add now,while I was saying that there is obviously the section in theAct dealing with the hearing, if I can refer you to the specificsection, section 30 which deals with the procedure to be followedat an investigations and hearings, which says that,\n  \"If during any investigation by or any hearing before theCommission any person is implicated in a manner which may be tohis or her detriment the Commission shall, if such person is available,afford him or her an opportunity to submit representations tothe Commission within a specified time with regard to the matterunder\n5A consideration/...\n231 ADDRESS\n  consideration or to give evidence at a hearing of the Commission\".\nSo it is possible obviously, and that is what I wanted to addto this.  It is possible that the Commission could decide thatcertain of the people named might be offered an opportunity ofpresenting the Commission with representations.  As I understandthat the Commission can decide if it should be written representationsor if it should be representations at a possible further hearing. That is how I interpret the Act.  So I do not want, at this stage,to finally commit myself on saying that everything is closed exceptfor Joe Mamasela.  I cannot do that in the light of this section.",
