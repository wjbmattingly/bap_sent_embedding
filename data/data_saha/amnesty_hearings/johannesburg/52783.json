            "Today what's on the roll is the Amnesty Application of Mr Aggie Shoke - Amnesty Number 8014/97 and Harold Matshididi - Amnesty Number 8007/97.  Today is the 3rd August and the Amnesty Committee sits in Johannesburg at the Institute of Social Services, Queens Road, Mayfair.\n\tMr Chairman, at the appropriate time, the transcribers have requested that the Members of the Committee as well as the legal representatives simply identify their voices before the proceedings start so that any transcription can be properly transcribed attributing the questions and or statements to the voice.  Can that be done after I address?\n\tMr Chairman, before I continue there was some problem with the obtaining of more particulars regarding the events.  I have supplied you with a number of documents relating to the correspondence with the former legal representative of the applicants.  I do not propose to go into any detail at this stage but should the Committee deem it necessary, obviously it will place that on record.  Suffice to say that any delay in the matter has not been caused by Mr Landman at all, he having come into the matter at a very late stage.  \n\tMay I also place on record that only this morning was it brought to my attention that there are two other names that have been names possibly as implicated or applicants in this matter.  One Mr Dumakude and one Mr Dube.  They are both however represented by Mr Greg Knott of the firm Bell, Dewar and Hall of Johannesburg.  Mr Knott and I have been in communication with each other and I've appraised him of the situation.  Given the extent of their complicity or participation of the events of Ellis Park Bombing, he is happy to join in the proceedings tomorrow and to that end will be in attendance tomorrow with his clients, the persons I have mentioned.  He will be brought up to speed with the evidence tendered this afternoon.",

Sorry I don't have all the dates but we know that there were several bomb attacks or car bombs on for example places like the Witwatersrand Commando Building.  There was an attack, a bomb blast at the Irish Regiment in Johannesburg.  There was bomb blast in Church Street which was directed at the S.A.D.F. Headquarters.  We know that there was an attack on the Magistrates Court in Johannesburg where policemen were in attendance and they were the people that were killed.  I'm suggesting to you that those targets, if we talk about them in military terms because of their association with the military or the police, were called hard targets.  Yet the Ellis Park matter, there seems to be a deviation from that strategy and a bomb is placed in such a position near Ellis Park Rugby Stadium and it seems to be directed at civilian people.  My question is - did you not appreciate that as a departure from the strategy of your unit, that is your special operations, that now you were moving away from hard targets and now you were targeting civilians, soft targets.

It was brought to my attention when the Committee adjourned to just put to Mr Matshididi, the applicant, the aerial photograph that appears at page 35 of the bundle.  Unfortunately we were only able to get a photocopy of the photograph.  Point A according to the key in respect of the photographs, that's at page 33, indicates the crater in Upper Meyer Street and at the top of the photograph to the right hand side one clearly sees the Ellis Park Rugby Stadium.   That photograph is being shown to Mr Matshididi and a pink line was drawn - obviously the Committee hasn't seen it, if I may just show you Mr Chairman?  And along that perimeter I'm instructed by the people who were at the scene of that evening looking for Mr Klukas and I don't really want to make an issue of it at this state, if it's material enough it will be clarified but along that pink line apparently was the perimeter and somewhere along that line was the entrance gate.  Would you please show Mr Chairman the entrance to the stadium, in other words persons passed through a ticket gate as it were somewhere along that line and then they proceeded on foot further into the premises to the stadium and what I've been asked to put to Mr Matshididi is that if Point A is the craters where the bomb exploded, then from that aerial photograph one sees that the distance is not very great to the perimeter of the stadium.  In other words it's not a great distance it's a fairly close distance.  May I just indicate that the original photographs I understand are with the Attorney General, Mr D'Oliveira, and obviously we are presently making efforts to get the originals to the hearing.
