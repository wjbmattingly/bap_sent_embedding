<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I call Thanduxolo Patrick Mquibi 7375/97 on page 237.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mqibi what language do you wish to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">THANDUXOLO PATRICK MQIBI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SAMUELS:</span> Mr Mquibi how old are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> 44.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And are you a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And you were a commander of Extension 2, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Yes I was then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Are you also known as Meneer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Yes I'm known as Meneer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I see.  Now Mr Mqibi, you're applying for two counts of arson, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> I didn't burn anyone's house but I sent people to go or I instructed people to burn somebody's houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that all he's applying for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Yes there are two counts of arson.  This applicants evidence could be heard in chambers, is that what you're alluding to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> This evidence will be very short, it's only to say "Yes I gave a command and yes it was followed", it will be very short evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> The first incident of arson was to burn down whose home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Mr Masibuko's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> February 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And who did you order, who did you give these orders to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Comrades Sibusiso Afrika and other many guys because Phola Park were helping us.  The only one that I remember was Sibusiso because I sent him to go and tell other comrades and he told other people from Phola Park as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I see and do you know whether the house was burnt down or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> I know it was burnt down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whose house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Mr Masibuko's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Mr Masibuko's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> The second incident, whose home did you order to be burnt down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Sibongele's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Now what order did you get?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> After I met with Ben and I discovered that he was from a meeting, the community meeting, I discovered that Sibongele was an IFP member.  I got this from Ben Mashinini.  As an elderly, older than Ben, I said to Ben if that's the case then she deserves to die including the people who are staying with her.  At that time, it was at night, I left with Ben.  When we arrived at Danger Zone I met Jambo and Mgwele, I gave them the instruction as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Sorry Mr Mqibi, what order did you give them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> That Sibongele's house must be burnt including herself if she is inside the house she must be killed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I see and did they carry out that order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Yes they did that but after three days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I see.  Thank you.   Thank you Mr Chairperson, that is his evidence in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SAMUELS</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> I have no questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:</span> Mr Mqibi who was or is Mr Masibuko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Would you please the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Who is Mr Masibuko?  Why was he a target in other words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> As everyone knows that ANC and IFP were fighting.  After three years everyone in the township knew exactly who was the member of the IFP and who was the member of the ANC so he was a member of IFP from 1990 up to 1993 when we burnt down his house.  We knew exactly that he was a member, not that we suspected that he was a member of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Is that the only reason that he was a target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> That's not the only reason.  His actions, his words, things that he used to say to people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> What were these actions, words and things that he used to say to people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Everytime when there was a meeting or when hostel dwellers were going to attack in the townships, he was accompanying the hostel dwellers and he used to oppose everyone from the township and these were his actions and his words.  This is why his house was attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Right and in terms of Sibongele, you said that you received your information from Ben Mashinini that she was an IFP member.  Is that the only information that gave to you, regarding her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Yes that's all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> He didn't say perhaps that she was an informer or anything more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> He said even the IFP used to go to her house and after the attacks IFP used to go and celebrate in her house.  We didn't attack people's houses because we suspected them but we attacked people's houses because we knew we had the knowledge that we've been there for a long time and we knew Sibongele.  We were not suspecting Sibongele, we knew, we were certain that she was an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Can I ask, were you involved in the process of disciplining the members who had raped Sibongele and her sister?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> No I wasn't a member of a disciplinary committee, I was a commander.  When these two boys were disciplined I wasn't in the township, I was in a meeting.  We never used to go together, Ben and myself.  He will be left behind and I'll go to a meeting or he'll go and I'll be left behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.  Thank you Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Masibuko, have you got the address where he was living?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> He was staying at number 4, Extension 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Is he still living there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> They left, him and his family, I don't know where they've gone to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But he left at Extension 4, number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Number 4, Extension 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Which number?  You've mentioned a number I couldn't - oh, number 4, Extension 2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And his house was destroyed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Yes his house was destroyed to ashes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You've got no idea what happened to him, whether he is still alive or what's the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> What I'm going to say now is hearsay.  I don't have solid evidence.  What I heard is that he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The only reason I'm asking is because we must make a recommendation about victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> If I may for the record state that our investigative unit have tried without fail to locate this particular victim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes mean without success?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Yes of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I close my case for this applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> He is asking for amnesty, he testified that he in fact ordered them to kill Sibongele in the first instance.  They didn't succeed in killing her.  He is not applying for any offence in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> I don't understand, if you may repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, you gave an order for the killing of Sibongele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Sorry, I met that first point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your or your client gave the order for the killing of Sibongele.  In our minds that gives rise to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Common purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Criminal liability.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Yes, can I interrupt?  I assume you're coming to the point of should the applicant have applied for attempted murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, we're just checking whether he wants to or didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Yes, at this very late stage may I have leave to amend his request and ask that the crime of attempted murder be included, that is at a very late stage I appreciate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I don't think you're amending sort of what you told us here but there's no mention of ...(inaudible) or attempted murder in the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Quite correct and again it's my ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well that's going to fall into that argument we've asked you to address?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Numerous - yes I appreciate it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you go Mr Mqibi, you are one of the on the ground leaders or used to be in that area, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> I was a commander that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now while things have happened and there's nothing we can do to change it, people have lost their properties, people were injured, people lost family members, how do you feel about that today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Thank you very much for asking that question, it's a very good question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know it's good that's why I asked it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> What happened at that time was terrible, the devil came and was living with us and that's why today we are here to ask for amnesty.  We don't know where the devil came from and who brought the devil in South Africa.  Even today if you see the people who got injured it's sad, it's sad to everyone because somebody's blood is never quiet or somebody's soul, that's why I'm here today to ask for amnesty.  I'm not asking this from the people who suffered only, I'm also asking from other people who suffered, even the whites especially in Section 2, too many whites died there.  I'm saying I'm very much sorry, it wasn't our intention, we were defending ourselves and the devil was among everyone of us and now I'm asking for forgiveness, even to Sibongele.  It wasn't the intention, the devil came, we were living together and the devil came and divided us.  He made sure that some people died and some are suffering and I want to tell everyone in this house that devil just came and we are very sorry.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you see, how are things in the area now, are they quite, peaceful or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> It's quite and very peaceful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the last time this devil came to pay his attention to the area was just before the last elections, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> It was just after the election when the devil passed and people lived.  If I can tell you today how it was and then take you today and go with you to Thokoza, you will think that I'm lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I know what you're talking about.  How do I ask the question you know, would you agree that was real madness, people dying for nothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> I don't know whether people were mad but what I can agree with is that the devil was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm not saying the people were made I'm saying what happened there was madness, it was not right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> The situation was really bad.  Whether it was madness or what I don't know but it was very bad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right.  Now next year these elections come along again, you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Yes I know that very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you know the devil may just come pay his respects again, not so?  It always happens election time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> That's correct because the devil can come again but he likes those situations, we didn't know the first time he was going to come and he came and he might come again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you think the people of the area can learn the lesson of the last time and resist doing and repeating what happened last time, if the devil does come back here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> I would say people who had been present, people who had experienced the past, if there's anyone who is going to allow the devil to enter his heart, that person won't be a living human being.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that people have learned their lesson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> Yes they have truly learned to wait for the devil so that when he comes he mustn't enter their hearts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well all I can say is that I hope that you are right and if the devil does come I can only plead with you to do your best to avoid him being successful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MQIBI:</span> I'm happy, thanks for that, I hope it will be like that too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
