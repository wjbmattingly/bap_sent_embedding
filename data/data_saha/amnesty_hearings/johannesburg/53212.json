There are however a number of factors which alter the digestive process, one of which, which is important to consider, is stress.  I don't know the circumstances of this death, but if for instance during the meal or shortly after the meal this man had been subjected to stress, in other words either verbal or physical, the whole digestive process would come to an end.\n\tWe on occasion see people who had been lying in hospital for a week, still with stomach content in them because the whole movement of the stomach actually stops.

In a normal individual a meal would take about two hour to be digested and pass through in four hours, but due to various factors, for instance if you've eaten a fatty meal it's retarded, it you are stressed it's retarded, if you've had a lot of fluid with your meal, the movement through to the intestines will be speeded up.  Because of these various factors one cannot be categorical, but usually undigested means that you've died soon after being shot, but as I say, with the exceptions that I have mentioned today.",
