<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>DAY 3 :  23 OCTOBER 1996</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> ...sight of the regulations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Yes, the regulations, the Commission's regulations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes what I have is I have a copy of theguidelines in respect of procedure.  As far as the regulationsin terms of the Act are concerned I was given the indication bythe people we dealt with at the Truth Commission that the regulationshave not been published, specific regulations under the Act havenot been published yet.  So I am not aware of any regulationswhich have been lawfully published.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Mr Mpshe can you tell us about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman I am not aware of the regulationsto the Act being promulgated here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> (Inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman as far as ...(indistinct) representationis concerned it is included in the Act, I think section 34 thereofmakes mention of that, but I am not aware of the regulations,but section 34 makes room for the last thing that the Chair hasjust indicated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The regulations have been published asfar as the prescribed form is concerned and the annexure of thenature of the notice is prescribed in form 2 in the same regulations. That is as far as notice is concerned to applicants and to peopleinterested and families and victims.  I think the HRV Committeewas in the process of promulgating regulations in connectionsof section 29</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>1. hearings/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>236</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>hearings and that was where subpoenas were dealt with.  So ifyou can investigate whether there is a prescribed form of thesubpoena and what that would prescribed, it's not in the Act. There's not an inscription in the Act, it's only authorisingus to promulgate the regulations but I don't know whether theyhave promulgated the regulations in connection with subpoenas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman inasfar as I concur with the memberof the Committee just about the regulations, but inasfar as thequestion of the subpoenas concerned in terms of Section 29 thespecifications are mentioned in Section 29 itself to the effectthat it has got to be in this form, it has got to be signed byyour Commissioner and the form must indicate the time and placewhere this person must appear.  Now what I am trying to say isinasfar as a subpoena is concerned we do not have a problem, theTRC has got a policy on that.  And that is the same policy thatI used when we subpoenaed General van der Merwe.  A subpoena canbe issued, we have a policy and we've got a legal opinion on thataspect.  That one is clarified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman I may mention that I am inpossession of a copy of the subpoena utilised by the Truth andReconciliation Commission.  I have read through it now.  It doesn'trefer to the Criminal Procedure Act, it doesn't refer to the regulationsand it doesn't make provision for any time period.  It is justa subpoena requesting or ordering the person to come and giveevidence or to answer questions relevant to the applications ata hearing.  I wasn't under the impression, apart from the formthat has been promulgated that any other regulations have beenpromulgated.  So the way I read it is that the Commission</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>1. can/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>237</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>can act in terms of Section 29 and subpoena anybody in respectof the holding of a hearing by notice in writing to appear beforethe Commission and to give evidence or to answer questions relevantto the subject matter of the hearing.  And that is why I directthat request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> As I understand your request in respectof these two persons would be to give evidence relating to andrelevant to the Pepco 3, to be limited to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> We will adjourn for a few minutes to considerthe application.  If any other parties have any requests theycan notify us.</p>

<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> We direct that notice in writing in termsof Section 29(1)(c) of Act 34 of 1995, the Promotion of NationalUnity and Reconciliation Act be given to Mr Sakkie van Zyl, MrDion Nieuwoudt, Mr Gert Besselaar and Mr Winter who was stationcommander at Cradock in 1985, these being the persons referredto in the evidence yesterday of Colonel Venter, that they arecalled upon to appear before the Commission on Monday the 28thof October to give evidence in connection with the Pepco 3 at09H30 at this venue.</p>

<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> In the light of the information that thereis a likelihood of Mr Nieuwoudt and/or his legal representativeturning up this morning at about 11 o'clock, it might be prudentto take no further decisions on what should happen in connectionwith the proceedings in which they are required to give evidence.  If it does not inconvenience Mr De Villiers, can you Mr De Villiersmake yourself available a little later in the day when we canascertain whether Mr Nieuwoudt is represented?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE VILLIERS::</span> Mr Chairman I suppose we will still behere at 11 o'clock but we would also apply for a postponementof our client's testimony on the same basis that we did not haveenough time to prepare and also to</p>

<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>obtain information of the testimony and so forth, and then</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>to apply to the Committee to give the testimony at a later stage.  We would also apply with Mr Nieuwoudt it seems for a postponement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes I think it would be appropriate for usto consider this application, your application for postponement,your application for postponement, in conjunction with Mr Nieuwoudt'sapplication.</p>

The purpose of this action was to actagainst the ANC and other liberation movements with a revolutionaryonslaught against the apartheid government to destabilise andpersuade them.   The motive of the act was to counter terrorismand to protect the country.   A further motive was to eliminatethe activists so that further actions against the State and thepublic could not be perpetrated.   The context against which thishappened was against the background of an emergency situationin the country, as well as the continuing violence, intimidationsand unrest.   The liberation movements attempted to make the countryungovernable at this stage as part of their political rebellion.  The legal nature of the act and the facts of the act is apparentfrom the nature and particulars of the act, as mentioned.   Thepurpose and goal was to intimidate or eliminate an ANC activist,supporter or terrorist.   The action against Thibedi was carriedout under the instructions as mentioned above.   The purpose wasnecessary to eliminate an ANC terrorist, activist or supporterwhich was necessary in view of the struggle, and the securitysituation in the country.   Actions against activists, as faras I know, had under most circumstances been successful.   Stepstaken against activists would therefore have been successful incountering the intimidation and</p>

<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter before we continue with yourtestimony could you tell the Committee briefly what the problemswere which you are experiencing at this moment with your memory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chair I have a large memory problem, a seriousmemory problem.   I have received psychological evaluation, Ihave been informed that this is a voluntary loss of memory whichI am enforcing myself, they cannot find anything wrong with me.  This particular incident with regard to Gerry Thibedi I cannotremember at all.   I am, however, willing with regard to my colleaguesand to take responsibility for this act because they will nottell me lies.   I fully believe what my colleagues have told meand I take responsibility for these acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter the contents of your application,where did you receive this information which is in your applicationwith regard to this particular incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> To which page are you referring Mr Du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Page 170 of the Hechter application, the informationin your application, from whom or how did you obtain this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chair this information as a whole was informedto me or was given to me by W/O Van Vuuren, I can only say whatis on paper here.   If I were to expand on this I would lie]</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>1b so /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 257 J HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>so what is on the paper here is what I can remember after I hadbeen informed by W/O Van Vuuren.   I have no</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>recollection of this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter with regard to the politicalmotivation, with regard to these actions, you have heard the testimonyof Mr Van Vuuren in this regard.   Would you agree with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would you consider these motivations also tohave been your own in these actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I must say to the Commission that for two yearsI was actively involved in combatting terrorism and the combattingof activists.   The purpose was broadly to combat communism, theANC/SACP alliance, broadly speaking.   At that time during theyears 86/87, the ANC, as Mr P W Botha told us was involved ina total onslaught against the country and this onslaught wouldhave been against primarily civilians.   The purpose would havebeen to intimidate civilians, to voluntarily but also under someintimidation act against the government of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter, with regard to eliminationof activists, could you explain to the Commission why it was consideredto be necessary under certain circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes Mr Chair, these activists were generally,at least those which we targeted for elimination, were generallythe stronger activists, the more intelligent activist, a personwho would have incited the youth to action of various other criminalacts, necklacing murders and then at the last moment he wouldhave stood back after having incited the youth to these actions.  To arrest these persons subsequently would have been a wasteof time, I</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>1b imagine /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 258 J HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>imagine that one of the persons that gave testimony that we didnot need further Nelson Mandela's, if this person would</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>have been allowed out of jail this person would have become ahero to his community, which we could not have allowed at thattime.   It would not have been proper at that time to create heroesin this manner.    By eliminating such a person there would automaticallyhave been an effect on the civilians who, along with the militaryand police targets which we then in our own way we attempted todefend, by eliminating a person before he could act in certainways, we defended the civilian population.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter, your information system wasit adequate for instance with regard to the case Thibedi to provideyou with information ahead of time that he would have forced peopleto eat raw eggs or raw food.   Would you have been able to stopa person from acting in such a way or was that impossible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Unfortunately not, since we were working withinformants who had to write a report which had to be gatheredat a central point, or which we had to obtain at a central point.  This information we would only have obtained a day or so afterthe incident.  We also worked with a number of informants andthe different reports had to be accumulated and transformed intoa central document which would then have told you what had happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter would it therefore have beenpossible at all to stop such a person prior to acting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Unfortunately not Chair, we only obtained theinformation subsequent to the events, after the act was committedwe were only able to act against such a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter was there any other approach</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>1b available /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 259 J HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>available to you in order to act against these activists and terroristswho committed serious acts of terror also against civilians?  Would there have been other ways for you to prevent such a person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No Chair, our security legislation only had atemporary effect, you could only remove a person for 180 daysmaximum out of the community.   When he returned to the communityhe would then have been a hero of that community, you would havemade such a person into a martyr, you would have strengthenedthat person in that community.   Under such circumstances werean activist was very strong it was necessary preferably to eliminatesuch a person.   A good example is Mr Thibedi, look at his positionin the ANC today.  The information available to us then wouldhave been correct, that he was a very strong activist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter what would your view have beenwith regard to the question whether a war situation raged in thecountry at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Thinking back to those years we would see thateven on television our then State President, President P W Bothasaid that we were in a state of war and that there would neverbe any negotiations with the ANC, that we would combat them withevery means possible.   In our perceptions it was indeed a stateof war, admittedly unconventional as Mr Van Vuuren gave testimony,it was a completely unconventional war, but we were under circumstanceswhere violence in the most extreme form was used against us, someof my black colleagues in particular in Mamalodi were shot deadby activists, terrorists of the ANC.   Also in Mamalodi in thearea where I worked, there was also a limpet mine planted whichtook one of our caspir vehicles out of action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>1b QUESTION: /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 260 J HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter as you remember, in your memory,would the acts of these activists and terrorists have been</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>aimed solely against the South African police and military personnel,or also against civilians?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Certainly also civilians, many of these civilianswere also hurt in this conflict, many of them were informantsand as soon as the ANC determined that a particular person mighthave been an informant to the police, they would have eliminatedsuch a person, also by means of school boycotts, consumer boycotts,many of these civilians suffered unnecessarily.   Unfortunatelythe ANC made no distinction when they took a consumer boycottagainst a person, they simply acted in a similar way against everyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter your actions as in the caseof Mr Thibedi where you were given instructions to eliminate sucha high profile activist or terrorist, would this have been partof a counter-revolutionary action on the part of the South Africanpolice against the onslaught of the ANC and other liberation movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At that time it was Government strategy, it wasa counter-insurgency or counter-revolutionary strategy which evenin the State Security Council would have been discussed.   Itwas general knowledge that action would have been taken againstthese persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> How do you know that this would have been discussedin the State Security Council?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's the story that we were generally toldby our superiors that the State Security Council would have saidsomething, and that is simply the way in which the informationcame through to us, the staff on the ground.</p>

<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>I was not present at any of those meetings but I'm sure that ifwe look at minutes we would find that such minutes would be available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You also said that you are suffering a lossof memory, who is your doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I was at a Dr J P Verster as well as at a clinicalpsychologist Dr Matthews who took a battery of tests on me.</p>

<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chair it's difficult in 1988 I was in a seriouscar accident, immediately before that I went through a divorce.  For a large part of my hospital stay I can remember nothing.  With regard to certain of these incidents, with regard to whichI will also give testimony at a later stage in this application,I can remember parts.  I was told that this is a very selectivesuppression of certain acts and he said that as far as he is concernedI..(end of side B)...</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> You also say in your application that afterthe bomb was thrown into the house you ran some 50-100 metresaway from the house before it exploded.   Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Once again Mr Chair it was normal procedure,and this incident I can't remember this incident at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Mr Van Vuuren told you, I understood...</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct, according to what Mr Van Vuurentold me it must be correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> The next thing you say is "I am informedthat as we ran, W/O Van Vuuren looked backwards and saw that thehouse was no longer standing".   Was that also what Van Vuurentold you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>QUESTION INAUDIBLE ONLY AFRIKAANS AUDIBLE</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chair I noticed that that was the way in whichthe question was put, it must be wrong because Mr Van Vuuren testifiedthat it was a "safe-house" and your family definitelydoes not go with you to a safe-house.   So that must be wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> This is what you told your attorneys whenthey were filling up the application form, are you suggestingthey wrote down something you didn't tell them?</p>

<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> ...mainly of the things which happened atthe incident in question, is it possible for you to tell us whenthe Government decided that the emergency regulations were noteffective enough to counter the efficacy of the ANC and decidedto eliminate all activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chair it is very difficult to imagine howthe Government thought that up, what we received was the counter-revolutionarystrategical actions which we had to take and the words were "fightfire with fire".   That meant that if a person really cameinto the spotlight as being an activist who caused problems, hehad to be eliminated.   Where the true elimination assignmentcame from, I don't know and I will have to lie if I try to tellyou.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Are you familiar with an institution calledtrevits?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did hear about trevits but it was in main office,security main office, it was on a very secret level that trevitsexisted.   I did know about its actions but its real aim and goalor sittings I never attended, I never attended any trevits meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> To your knowledge was Mr Thibedi identified</p>

<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>as a target by trevits?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No unfortunately I can't answer this question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> ...to explain to us how information wasevaluated to assess its reliability in this case, in the instanceof Mr Thibedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I must explain the normal way of informationevaluation to you.   We had various sources that were codifiedafter, according to the veracity of previous reports we had received.  Before a person was selected for elimination we investigatedhis file and there must have been very bad actions and thingsin the file before such a decision was taken.   There were alsovarious informants in the community who were given orders to investigatea specific target, to investigate him and to inform us about whathe was doing and then we received weekly reports.   If the personwas very active, we even received more than one report per informantper week.   This information was then worked into one documentfor easy reference purposes and when such a person was identified,or when it was decided to take action against him I can assureyou that it came from many various informants.</p>

<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What do you think the effect will be if sayafter this hearing, after the application, you then regain yourmemory and remember perfectly well that you were not involvedin this matter at all.

<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I will certainly have nightmares but there isnothing one can do about that.   The only thing I can do now isto speak the truth as far as possible and to cast myself to themercy of the Truth Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Your application, you took an oath which yousigned, what was that oath for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That I will speak the truth as far as it is possibleto my knowledge.   I was told that I committed some deeds, mycolleagues would not lie to me, and therefore I accept that Itold the truth, that's why I took the oath.   I am prepared tostand by that which I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Page 171 of your application, the HonourableCommittee member did ask you about that, I'm still going backto it, the fourth paragraph where you say</p>

<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...that if it is W/O Van Vuuren who conveyedthis to you he would have known about it and testified about ithimself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I understand what you are asking and what youare aiming at, you must understand that we are talking about incidentswhich happened at least 10 years ago and in the meantime we allstarted new lives.  We all went out of the security police, therewere never any statements taken about what happened that nightand therefore I can't come to the Commission and tell the Commissionexactly what happened then.   For 10 years I have never thoughtabout the incidents, I never talked about them, it was never discussedin my house so you must accept that thoughts fade away.   We areonly human, it is possible to forget things like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...because when W/O Van Vuuren was testifyingwhen I put the question to him about this, then he readily saidthat this is not what I said in my application, no you come andsay that he's actually the person who told that this happened.</p>

<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Now seeing that you were being told almosteverything by W/O Van Vuuren, would you agree with me then itmeans that the possibility exists that you may not have told theCommittee everything pertaining to this particular incident andthis would impact itself of full disclosure?   Would you agreewith me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chair, everything that was told to me in whichI was involved, all the relevant facts were relayed in my applicationand I can't say anything more than that which is in my application.</p>

<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No they were never contacted, we went in undercover completely on our own.</p>

Would you say it wasa coincidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Obviously the police were much better then becausetoday you won't have the police coming to your house in 15</p>

<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Unfortunately not at all, I never went back toany of my, any of the places where I acted, I committed a deedin this case but I never went back.   We did receive reports butin the light of the fact that Gerry was not one of the subjectsof my office, I can unfortunately not help you, I do not know.</p>

<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>Was that from your personal recollection or...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No we discussed these issues Mr Van Vuuren andI, we sat in an office and discussed them and we wondered about</p>

<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>it and a lot of information became more clear as we discussedit.   If you forgot something and you discuss it with a colleagueor a friend, somebody who was with you for example at a rugbymatch you can perhaps later remember some of those things.   Ata later stage once again, you will disagree once again about amemory but this must during our initial discussion have come through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...in line with the trend of discussion youhad with Mr Van Vuuren?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I did hear in his testimony that this wasa safe-house, it was discussed at a later stage but in my applicationit was never corrected.   I accept that in his application itwas put that it was a safe-house but originally we discussed itand wondered if it was his house.  During our initial discussionsthis came to the fore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...in terms of the police understanding ofa safe-house, you would not expect a person to use a house inwhich, you wouldn't describe a person's house where he lived withhis family, as a safe-house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> If in fact there was a perception amongst youand your colleagues that Mr Thibedi lived in that house with hisfamily, then that house could hardly be described as a safe-house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that is so but I want to make it very clearthat possibly at a later stage it was corrected by Mr Van Vuuren,I only omitted to correct my application.   I heard in his applicationthat he said it was a safe-house, perhaps in the initial discussionduring our initial discussion thereof it was discussed that itwas his house.   It is possible but it is also true that a privatehouse can never</p>

<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> If this house can hardly be described as asafe-house, then it means you destroyed a house which was nota legitimate....</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The house was not the target, Mr Thibedi wasthe target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> In fact you could have...destroying the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Under circumstances yes but the problem we hadwas where do we find Mr Thibedi, when do we find him, he was livingin Shoshunguwe, we do not know the area of Shoshunguwe, it's farfrom our base and the place where we operated.   Times were difficultin black townships and one did not want to go into them unnecessarily.  Your yourself was there and you know how it was there.   Ifyou were found there you would have had problems, if you werea white person in a black township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...the police just got annoyed and angry withthis person and then they decided that we destroy his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chair no, we truly in all the cases in whichI was involved believed there were more than one reports frominformants, I received my information from Col Loots.  The volumeof information that came through which we received from variousinformants, we were never personally involved with these persons,he was the enemy and we were simply not personally involved.  We did not experience a personal feeling of animosity.</p>

<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter could you explain to the Committeebriefly, I know Mr Van Vuuren also did so, why you used a bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> This bomb, if it does not eliminate, has a remarkableintimidation factor in the first place, and then secondly thegeneral public as well as other security forces would have deducedthat the ANC was playing with explosives and simply blew themselvesup.   This was the rationale for our use of this kind of bombor explosive device.</p>

Thename is Francois Van der Merwe and I am from the firm Van derMerwe &amp; Bester in Port Elizabeth, an attorney's firm, I aman attorney.   I have arrived here this morning, I don't knowMr Chairman what you expect of me, I wasn't present when the previousprocedures took place.   We are unfortunately, I would respectfullyrequest that the proceedings be, as far as Mr Nieuwoudt is concerned,be postponed.

<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>MR VAN DER MERWE 272 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>the summons on Thursday afternoon at 15:00.   We are also notin a position to at this stage know what evidence has been ledbefore the Committee as such.   I think the principle of fairnessand equity would suffice that my client should be allowed to atleast be put in a position where he can have a look at all thedocumentation, statements and evidence that was led before theCommittee.  We are further also respectfully of the submissionthat in this instance there was a non-compliance with Section19(4) of the Act of the Truth Commission as Mr Nieuwoudt onlygot notice from the Truth Commission of this hearing simultaneouslywith the subpoena being served on him on Thursday afternoon at15:00.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a> I might just also add that we have got an undertaking which isan order of court from the Truth Commission that Mr Nieuwoudtwill be informed if any evidence should be led against him andwe have not been informed at any stage of any evidence that wasled.   This was also the source of litigation previously in theEastern Cape and I think Mr Valli(?), who is the chief legal representativeof the Truth Commission, is well aware of this court order.

<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE::</span> The court order says shortly that MrNieuwoudt would be supplied with all statements supplied to theTruth Commission proper as well as given notice of anybody, therewas no mention of a period.   The specific undertaking in thiscourt order is that it would be done prior to the evidence beingled obviously otherwise it would defeat the purpose of this courtorder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR ?::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Mr Van Zyl is in a verysimilar position in that it was served on him at 11:30 by wayof Mr Roux's office, his attorney on Thursday and he is in a similarposition that he's in the dark as to what is expected of him. We could not consult properly and all the rest that Mr Van derMerwe indicated to the Court.   We would also like to obtain information,the original application as well as a transcription of what happenedin the proceedings so we can in a proper manner look at it and</p>

<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Mr Van der Merwe I trust that you are notconveying that there is a court order binding on us, the AmnestyCommittee, which we failed to comply with.   I think it must beclarified that you are referring to a court order which (indistinct)different proceedings.   We don't stand here having not compliedwith any court order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE::</span> I will, let me say how I understandit at the moment.   The court order cited the Chairperson of theTruth Commission, Bishop Desmond Tutu, as well as the Truth Commission.  I think at this stage I'm not sure, I think we will reserveour rights in that regard, I don't know I haven't had time togo into it.   I am not making any allegations and I'm certainlynot looking to pick a fight at this stage.   All I'm saying iswe were under the impression that it would cover all the operationsof the Truth Commission, certainly this is something which canbe resolved I think fairly easily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Yes it can be and I was and I was justmentioning that, I was not trying to create obstacles in yourway.    I understand that your client, well I don't want to preachbut I understand your problem.</p>

I want to put it right that it cannotbe that he's in a similar position inasfar as the court orderis concerned, that only affects Mr Nieuwoudt alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> No, I think he was referring to the fact ofthe</p>

<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Then I am indebted to the Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman may I perhaps have an opportunityfrom the applicant's point of view just to comment on the applications?  Mr Chairman in respect of the court order, I've read in thenewspapers about the court order, I don't exactly know in whatway the court order binds this Committee.   What I would wantto say in respect of the 14 day period, I'm informed by my learnedfriend Mr Curran that that was applicable, or that is applicableto witnesses apparently who have to appear in front of the HumanRights Violation's Committee.   Mr Chairman if I read Section30 correctly, and especially Section 30(2), it makes provisionspecifically for this Committee to request a person to give evidenceat the hearing of the Commission.   If one reads Section 30(2)carefully, it says</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a>  "If during any investigations by or any hearing beforethe Commission, that means during any hearing before the Commission,any person is implicated in a manner which may be to his or herdetriment the Commission shall, if such person is available, affordhim or her an opportunity to submit representations..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>and then in the last sentence:</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>  "...or to give evidence at a hearing of the Commission."</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>Now that clearly must be the same hearing referred to in the firstsentence of sub-section (2).   I read this Section as meaningthat the procedure that the Committee has followed under thesecircumstances, is the correct procedure.   There is not time periodand obviously one then has to apply the</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>2b normal /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 276 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a>normal rules of natural justice, which means that a reasonabletime period afforded to a person would be proper.  The indicationis that both these witnesses have had knowledge of the fact thatthey are required to appear on Thursday and it is our view thatunder the circumstances, where we are not dealing with a criminaltrial or a civil trial and where we're simply dealing with somebodywho has to come and tell the truth, and where we are also dealingwith a situation that these witnesses will only be required togive evidence at these hearings in respect of the applicationof Col Venter, so their evidence will be very limited.   It willbe relevant pertaining to Col Venter's application.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a> On that basis we fail to see where any prejudice lies in respectof these witnesses, perhaps the only prejudice might be that theyhaven't seen the specific application and the written part thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE(?)::</span> I'm not even sure they need to see the applicationbeforehand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> I'm not even sure whether they were entitledto have sight into the application beforehand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> As I read the Act, they wouldn't havebeen entitled in any event, they are required to give evidenceat the hearing and that evidence should be dealt with in termsof the Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> I do not think it is necessary for us to gointo the matter as to whether they ought or not to have rightsor access to the evidence.   It does seem to me patently clearthat they have not had adequate notice and they would like toknow what they are going to be questioned about.   In the</p>

<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>CHAIRMAN 277</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a>circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that their applicationfor a postponement of this aspect of the case should be granted.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a> There is a problem to the extent that in respect of those individualswho have been served with a subpoena, this postponement unfortunatelycannot be arranged in such a way that I can postpone it to a fixeddate.   I would like them to signify personally and through theircounsel that they will not require a further subpoena in orderto attend the hearing at the adjourned date, which is to be determinedbetween counsel, Mr Mpshe and the other interested parties.  Thathearing can only take place at some stage which none of us atthis stage have any idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE::</span> Yes Mr Chairman I think that shouldn'tbe a problem to issue new summonses.   I am speaking for my client.</p>

<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a>had taken any part in the kidnapping or any part in what subsequentlyhappened and I should think it is regrettable if there was anyreport which indicated anything to the contrary.   It is his evidence,the evidence led indicated that he might well be able to throwa light on what was going on in his district at that time andit was for this purpose that he was subpoenaed as a witness.  We thank him for having come here today and I gather he alsosaw Mr Mpshe last week and is prepared to give such evidence.  We regret that because we are going to adjourn, we'll have toadjourn yours as well.   I trust we can make arrangements thatwe can give you adequate notice of the adjourned hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR WINTER::</span> Thank you sir, I accept it like that.   MayI just add this is, according to me a serious matter, the whole,my problem is that on Thursday evening while driving from workhome, I turned on my car radio to hear that I'm "verdwynsoos 'n groot kopspeld", a man who owns a home, who has afamily, has a fixed job that goes to church on Sundays, who doeshis shopping at every shop he needs to go, so I'm not runningaway from anything, I'm not hiding anywhere.   This is my mainproblem.   Such embarrassment has been caused that I'm now ina position where I don't know if I'm employed anymore becauseI can't blame my employer for, when he switched his radio on tohear his employee is a fugitive criminal.   That is my problem,that's my concern, so I don't know if somebody can rectify thisor will try and rectify this?   This broadcast was done by AngieCaprianos as far as I heard on the radio.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> I regret we have no control over broadcastsand I certainly have no recollection of it having been said atthis hearing that you had disappeared or anything of that</p>

<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman before we ask permission toleave, there is one other point we would like to take up withthe Commission and that's the point about costs.   We would askfor costs to be awarded for our client who is not in a positionto pay for his legal personnel, but if the Court wants us to submitlegal representations, we would rather do that and afford theCommittee an opportunity to go further with the hearing today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> I do not know whether I can make any rulingson the question of costs.   This is an Amnesty Committee whereissues of cost are not decided by the Amnesty Committee.   I thinkthat you must make your representations to the Truth and ReconciliationCommission, the appropriate officer there and see if you can negotiatewith them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> As the Committee pleases.</p>

We have received no assistance as far astravel arrangements and accommodation is concerned, I'm not talkingabout legal costs incurred.   I have reason to believe that thefamily members of the so-called Pepco Three as well as their legalrepresentatives were flown up here at the expense of the TruthCommission.   My client has been subpoenaed to come here, I wouldlike to know what the position would be just as far as coveringhis travel expenses and possibly we couldn't arrange for a flightback tonight, all the flights is (indistinct), we will be goingback at 6 o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> I can do no more than tell you to raise thematter with the relevant officer of the Truth and ReconciliationCommission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER(?)::</span> I think there are regulations, prescribedregulations as far as travelling costs and subsistence allowancesare concerned.   As the Chairman said, you can take that up withthe legal advisor of the Commission but there are regulationsapplicable and I think it's been done through the Legal Aid Boardand there are prescribed tariffs as far as witness fees and soon is concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE::</span> Is there any name of a person who Ican get in contact with?</p>

I find that we are now nearing 1 o'clock and itmight not be particularly prudent to make a beginning with a witnessmerely to have him sworn in and then to commence his evidenceafter the adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes Mr Chairman, I would prefer it ifwe could start with his evidence after the adjournment.</p>

<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I am the Speaker of the North-West ProvincialLegislature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Tibedi you were present in this hearingsince this morning when evidence was given by Mr Van Vuuren aswell as Hechter about yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You heard all that was being said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I would like you to testify to this Committeeas to what happened to you at the time when the bomb was beingthrown into your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I must say that firstly this is the most emotionalday of my life, having to sit inside this room together with peoplewho, nine years ago, threw a bomb into my own house.  I must saythat after listening to what they have to say, indicating thatthey have actually identified me as a trouble-maker, I find itvery difficult to accept that their final decision was to wipeme out, with my entire family.  For the mere fact that it tookme exactly nine years, nine solid years to know who did that,is a source of relief, at least I know who did it.   I must putit on record that the event took place on 22 October in 1987.  It happened at about 2 o'clock in the morning.   Prior to thatincident on 7 October of the same year, in 1987, there were peoplewho came to my place driving in a cream white E20, as I was informedby my wife who were looking for me at the time.   My wife becameso suspicious that even if they were policemen, their missionwas not to arrest, but they had a mission which was known to themselvesonly because they claimed to be comrades, they claimed to havebeen activists, they claimed to know me, but what surprised mywife the most</p>

<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>was to say, was when they asked her what kind of car am I driving.  I must say  that since that day when I arrived home, I leftimmediately and I was not to sleep at home again.   I only returnedback home on 19 October after a long drive, I was tired, I hadto sleep at home.   Little did I...</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> On the 19th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> On the 19th, that's when I returned home fromthe 7th.   When I slept at home on the 19th, nothing happened. When I woke up on the 20th I just thought, I told myself thatI must just as well continue to sleep in my house.  Little didI realise that two days thereafter, a bomb was going to be throwninto my house.   I must say that after that happened I was bothangry and relieved, because at least I knew they were lookingfor me, they couldn't get me, the attempted on my life and theyfailed.   That was the part that made me relieved, but the partthat they wanted to kill me with my entire family, and I havelost all my belongings, made me very angry.   The propaganda theyused, you must realise that that explosion was so powerful that10 houses in my surroundings were damaged and that created problemsbecause some members of the, of my, some members in my neighbourhoodwere convinced by the police propaganda, were convinced by thepolice propaganda that I had that bomb in my house and that that...bythe police propaganda thereafter that that bomb, I had it in myhouse, it exploded prematurely.   It took me some time to convincemembers within my community that this was actually done by noneother than the police because members of my community at the timeknew that I was arrested several times and apparently my onlyenemy at the time, I would assume, was the security</p>

<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>MR MPSHE 285 G D TIBEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>police.   I just want to clarify the point that the house whereI was sleeping, was my hideout.   That is not true.   That ismy house.   On the day of the incident I was sleeping in thathouse with my wife, my daughter and my sister.   My daughter wasseven at the time, seven years at that time.   She is 16 yearsnow.   My sister was 19, she was actually preparing for her Std10 examinations.   The trauma my family underwent after that incidentis very difficult to relate to this House.   My wife, my sisterhad continuous nightmares.   We had to consult with clinical psychologiststo try and help, and what hurt me most was that I did not knowwho did it.   I was hoping that I was going to testify last weekTuesday, it was going to be a coincidence because that was goingto be on the day of the 9th anniversary of that incident.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did any member of your family, including yourself,suffer any physical injuries as a result of the bombing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We got physical injuries but I wouldn't say theywere major, they were minor, we were affected by the shrapnel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You testified that you lost your belongings,do you perhaps know what you lost and to what extent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I lost all my furniture in the house, everythingthat you can imagine of that is kept in the house, was damaged.  An electric stove was reduced to the size of this bottle.</p>

<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>was a shack house, it was a tin house, therefore the bomb wastoo powerful for it, instead of it falling inside, it fell apart.</p>

<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I know it is quite a long time ago, but areyou in a position to tell this Committee exactly what you lostor would you chose perhaps to do that later in writing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I think it would be more convenient for me ifI can do it in writing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Then make the document available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Thank you.   Do you remember you and me consultedand you made mention of the fact that Col Gerry Mokubyane of thethen Bophutatswana police force arrived on the scene, 10 or 15minutes after the explosion.  Can you say something on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As I said, the incident occurred at about 2 o'clockin the morning.   At about 2:15 Col Gerry Mokubyane came leadinga squad of about 15 uniformed,</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a>M-o-k-u-b-y-a-n-e Gerry, he was a Colonel then.   Yes, he cameleading a squad of plus/minus 15 men in camouflage uniform.  The first thing he said to me was where were you when this thinghappened, and I said to him I was in the house.   His reply was,no, his reply was "no you were not in this house".  I said to him I was wearing a top of a pyjamas, a pyjamas shirt,I actually the father who stays in my back opposite borrowed mea trouser and when I went to the neighbour to knock of this incidentthey couldn't hardly open the door for me because the windowswere shattered, the door couldn't open up.   So I stood there,my little child was crying, we were shocked all of us, I didn'tknow who was</p>

<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>waiting on the side to shoot me in case I survived.   Then hecame, he accused me of not having been in the house.   Then Isaid to him I was in the house, I remember I got so angry becauseI said to him if you had prepared a statement about this incidentyou'd better go and read that statement as is, but I'm alive,I will counter it, that's what I said to him.   He immediatelyordered all of us to be taken to hospital.   I was refusing, butyou see the neighbour who persuaded me to say go into hospitalfor this minor injuries and for shock treatment is a good thingto do.   Little did I realise that when I arrive in hospital,he had already issued another car to follow me that will takeme from hospital to Zone 5 police station.   We were kept therefor a whole day, when my house was surrounded by police, who made...</p>

<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Myself, my wife, my daughter and my sister, atthe police station, from the hospital we were driven to the policestation after we were treated.   We were driven to the policestation, we were kept in separate rooms.   I remember my littledaughter was crying all the time trying to find out what happened.  I couldn't offer any answer because I was shocked myself.  Then whilst we were at the police station, the house was surroundedby all this group of policemen.   They made sure that they takeeach little evidence out of that place.   I must say that whenI was returned home, I don't know how many police cars were there. My house or my yard looked like a mini police station, therewere many police cars in there.   They collected each little evidencethey could come across, then they requested me or they demandedof me to report to the police station.   That</p>

<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a>I must report to the police station the following day and afterconsulting with Chiddel (indistinct) &amp;..... who were representingme at the time, I was advised not to do so but rather to go tothe lawyers.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a> The following day the organisation which I belonged to at thetime, Cosatu, sent the assistant secretary-general of Cosatu atthe time, who is now the Minister of Public Safety &amp; Security,Mr Sidney Mafumali to come and assess the damage.   He did exactlythat and he reported back to Cosatu that everything was damagedbut no one was killed.   The lawyers tried all the time to tryand gather information as to what happened, who did what, butthey could not come up with any answer. </p>

<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I was not charged, what happened is that ColMokubyane was having a tape as he was questioning me and his questioningline was that why do I belong to organisations and he said tome, because I was, I was a little bit surprised as to why I should,my belonging to an organisation be a problem because I said tohim no, I don't see anything wrong if I belong to an organisationand he called in, there's a white gentleman who came in, unfortunatelyI can't remember who it was, but apparently he was phoned andhe came from Pretoria, I suspect he came from Compol(?), who camewhen Mokubyane was questioning me.   He sat there, he did notquestion me, but he was writing each and little information thatI was actually giving out to Mokubyane especially around my activities,which</p>

<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well I thought, and I still believe even at thismoment, that there was some kind of communication between thesecurity police and the hit-squad department together with theBop Government.   I am convinced in my own mind that couldn'thave been a coincidence.</p>

<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Tibedi you heard the evidence of the applicants,not only today and the other days when you were here, that theyare sorry for what they have done to you and</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>3 that /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>MR MPSHE 290 G D TIBEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>that is the purpose for their application for amnesty.   Whatwould your response be to their application and remorse statedby themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> You see that is a very difficult question toanswer, more especially if you find yourself in my situation whereyou only realise now who did this kind of thing.   You see itmust also be dealt with at two levels, I must deal with it attwo levels.   The first level will be at a family level, I'llhave to deal with it at a family level first and try to seek consensuswithin my family members as to what their feelings will be.  Yes, they claim I was a target, but in their action they knewthey were not only targeting at me, they knew they were killingme and my entire family.  That's why I'm saying I still have toconsult at that level.  The second level will be at an organisationallevel, I am a member of the Provincial Executive Committee ofthe ANC and surely at that level I've got to share some of theseexperiences with my colleagues.   Having said that I am awareof the position of the ANC inasfar as the whole question of Nationalreconciliation is concerned and I am fully in support of whatthe ANC says about National reconciliation.   I also agree thatreconciliation cannot be given until there is full disclosure,we can only be given amnesty once we have disclosed everythingand they we will be able to achieve, to achieve reconciliation.  In my own mind, in my own mind I don't think the process ofamnesty, as we are sitting today, will work until we get a fullcommitment from the perpetrators.   You see, to say I'm sorryI won't do it again is not enough.   We are sitting with a problemwhere the victims are the ones who seem to be expected to sayI am sorry all the time.   I'm saying here</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>3 that /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>MR MPSHE 291 G D TIBEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>that it's high time that the perpetrators also, not only in wordsbut in deeds, they must be able to go all out and convince theircommunities that yes, we acted in this way and we acted wrongly.  It's not enough to say to me I am sorry Tibedi, but to me Ithink the process will be assisted a great deal if they can goout and say to their own communities whom they were trying toprotect, as they are claiming, they must go and say to them wedid it in the name of apartheid, we are sorry we apologise andwe want you to follow us in this example.   Then the process,the process will then be easy, the process of reconciliation willthen  be easy, but that's my view.   So I'm sorry I don't havea yes or no answer to your question.</p>

<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Because Mr Tibedi I've heard what you testifiednow and I want to draw your attention to the fact that what youasked of the applicants now, right at the end, in respect of reconciliationand where you said that the</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>3 process /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 292 G D TIBEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>process will be assisted if the applicants go out and say theydid it in the name of apartheid, I want to draw your attentionto the fact that in the opening statement they said the following:</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>  "We do not believe that our endeavours to uphold apartheidwere worth the pain and suffering on both sides and we are ofthe firm belief that the actions of both sides of the conflictwere excessive and unnecessary, and could have been avoided.  We believe that the truth will assist in preventing such happeningsto occur in future in South Africa."</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>They also said:</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>  "We will give evidence about our actions during the timeof the conflict and will show that all our actions were purelyand simply associated with the political objective to uphold theNational Party Government and apartheid, to fight Communism andto resist liberation of South Africa."</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>They said on page 4:</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>  "We were brought up to believe in apartheid.   We weremade to believe that apartheid was sanctioned by God through thechurch.   We were made to believe that our participation in thesecurity forces was justified to uphold apartheid.   We were madeto believe that black people were inferior and the needs and emotionsand the aspirations of black people differed from ours.  We weremade to believe that we were superior and that these differencesjustified apartheid.   We have come to realise that these beliefswere</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>3 wrong /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 293 G D TIBEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>   wrong, morally and in reality and we do not hold these beliefsanymore.   We believe that the example set by the President ofSouth Africa, Nelson Mandela in respect of reconciliation, forgivenessand understanding should be followed by everyone in South Africa."</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>Does that accord with what you testified just now you expect fromthe applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> To some extent yes, but I also think, you'llforgive me if maybe it is mentioned somewhere in your statement,I also think that it will be important if we take it beyond thatbecause I read that statement to mean that it is a statement preparedfor this particular hearing and I think that it will be usefulif the individual members concerned could take it beyond, beyondthis particular moment and be able to go out there in their communitiesand do exactly that because that is the main problem that we arebeing faced with and talking here on behalf of the organisationto say people are not happy about the manner in which the perpetratorsseem to be responding.   So I am saying to a certain extent orto some extent, yes that statement does cover what I said as myclosing remarks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Tibedi do you accept that what was saidin the opening statement by the applicants come from their hearts,that they mean it and that they are bona fide?</p>

<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Tibedi is there any basis upon which youcan say to us that you can't accept it?</p>

<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...is that right, and as I understand or asI make the deduction, and tell me if I'm wrong, you have yourwhole life been in leadership positions, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> My whole, my adult life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes, can you give us a little bit of informationof the leadership positions you were in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well my leadership positions actually revolvedaround the trade union movement basically.   I will start from1980.   From 1980 I was employed by Siemens and that is whereI became active, I was working in their laboratory, that is whereI became active as a shop steward.   I was then elected chairpersonof the committee in Siemens plant.  The following year I was electedsecretary of the National Shop Steward Council of Siemens Groupof Companies.   I was elected secretary of the National Shop StewardCouncil of Siemens Group of Companies and in 1983 I was electedchairperson of the Pretoria area of the Metal &amp; Allied WorkersUnion.   That is the position I held until 1995 when I was elected,the beginning of 1996 when I was elected chairperson of Cosatuin the Northern Transvaal Region.</p>

<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You supported, tell me if I'm wrong - if mydeduction is wrong - you supported the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The ANC was a banned organisation, I was a memberof the United Democratic Front, in 1983, from 1983.</p>

<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes.   At that stage, even though the ANC wasa banned organisation and you could not say too much loudly aboutit, did you support the ideals and the methods of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I supported the ideals enshrined in the FreedomCharter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Tibedi the, if you'll just bear with meMr Chairman, have you had any discussions with Mr Van Vuuren andMr Hechter during these proceedings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I had discussions with Mr Van Vuuren this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes, and was there any suggestion made to youabout appearing with Mr Van Vuuren on a television programme?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What was your reaction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well I, firstly I was opposed to it but aftersome explanation it was explained to me that the purpose of theappearance is for me to ask Mr Van Vuuren some questions as towhy he did what he did.   I made it very clear that if there isany television appearance I would like to appear on my own andgive my own version, so which means that appearance is simplyto ask those questions and get some clarity on those questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes, Mr Tibedi I just want to put it to youthat Mr Van Vuuren, as I understand it, has extended a hand offriendship to you, that he was prepared to appear in this televisionprogramme with you and that from the side of the conflict thatboth Mr Van Vuuren and Mr Hechter comes from, that they bear no- from their point of view in respect of actions against them- they bear no grudges and no animosity</p>

<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a>whatsoever towards you or towards anybody else who was involvedin the struggle.   What is your comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well my comment is simply that inasfar as dealingwith that matter is concerned, that matter will be located withinthe whole question of whether I accept or I don't accept theirapplication for amnesty, and I accept, I prefer to deal with thatmatter at the levels that I have explained.   Secondly I wantto say that Mr Van Vuuren, or the person who spoke to me aboutthe interview did not indicate to me whether that interview wasarranged on conditions or on pre-conditions because if that isthe case then I'm prepared to reconsider my position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Right thank you.   The only reason why I putthis to you is to explain to you what Mr Van Vuuren's attitudetowards you is today.</p>

<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> And that also includes Mr Hechter's attitudetowards you.    Mr Tibedi were the trade unions involved in consumerboycotts at a specific time during the 1980's, as a general question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well generally I would say it depends which sectorthe union is organising in, but as far as I can remember yes therewere some Cosatu affiliates who get involved in consumer boycotts,but you see there are other unions also who couldn't get involvedin consumer boycotts simply because what they are producing wasnot something that was directly consumed by the community, thereforeit was difficult for you to say to the community boycott thisparticular product.   Therefore I will say yes some unions gotinvolved in consumer boycotts but others did not, depending onwhat kind of products was involved.</p>

They begin to enquire about my movements and they saidactually they were coming to inform me that the police were afterme therefore I should take cover and they were saying they willbe available in case I would like to be assisted in terms of whereto go an hide so that they should actually drive around with meand they, they took some rounds, a few rounds, two or three roundsin that area before I actually arrived.   Fortunately my wifewalked up my neighbourhood and she actually used a telephone,a telephone, in one of the houses in my street where she was actuallytrying to find out where I was at the time.</p>

<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> How many people came and made enquiriesat your house at that time, the few days before when you weren'tthere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The information I have received is that one personcame to knock at the door but they were driving in a Kombi andas that person was moving back to the Kombi my wife saw that therewere a number of people in the Kombi but she couldn't actuallytell how many were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Could she say whether it was black or whitepeople?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well the guy who came to knock at the door wasa black person but those who were in the car we don't have anyinformation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well it was for the first time that people cameto my house to inform me that the police were actually lookingfor me, I should take cover.   Usually when the police come, evenmy comrades don't even know because they also fall victims ofthat arrest, they usually arrest me early hours of the morningso it was a strange thing that all of a sudden people coming witha Kombi saying they are coming to tip me off that the police areactually looking for me, but not knowing what kind of a car I'mdriving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> So you honestly believe that the peoplewho ultimately came and bombed your house are the same peoplewho initially came on 7 October and spoke to your wife about yourwhereabouts?</p>

<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>  "Father Makatshwa was in Soshunguwe, a very prominent figure,also a well known figure amongst the youth and a person well-knownto the security police due to his involvement in politics.   Hewas a powerful supporter of the ANC and Father Makatshwa was alsoa widely-read person, well-read into the purposes of the Communist'smovement.   In that time during the 1980's he was very activeamongst the youth, involved in school boycotts and other boycotts.  In terms of the information available to us he was also involvedin the providing of housing to terrorists as these moved or travelledfrom one place to another.   Because of his incitement of theyouth there were many incidents of arson involving the youth.  Since Father Makatshwa was indeed a thorn in our flesh, a decisionwas made at a higher level to eliminate him.   We approached ourtechnical section in the security police and had two rifles preparedwith the appropriate rounds.   The one was a 308 which then usedthe same rounds as an R1 and the other was a 22 rifle, both ofthese were provided with..."</p>

<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>wall he had a book-rack in which he had Communist books by Lenin,Engels, books on counter-espionage, espionage, books on terrorism.  Father Makatshwa knew about revolutionary and counter-revolutionaryactions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter I was just informed that heis Father Makatshwa and not Bishop Makatshwa.</p>

<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you think he was a Bishop, you keep referringto him as Bishop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chair I'm a member of the Dutch Reformed ChurchI know very little of other churches, for me a Bishop or a Fatherwould be the same kind of thing, I don't know.</p>

<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chair as I said we reacted on reports by ourinformation sources, if these reports were available I could giveyou an honest answer with documentary proof.   At this stage Ihave to deduce that this would have been the only reason why itwas decided that Father Makatshwa had to be eliminated, that itmust have been due to his involvement with youth and their violentactions subsequently.   That would have been the only way in whichto neutralise such violent actions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>  "...Father Makatshwa's telephone at that time had beenbugged by the security police and because of this and becauseof access to the phones of other prominent activists, it was possibleto obtain information that Father Makatshwa at a particular daywould have arrived at Durban airport.   From where he would havearrived I cannot remember, I cannot remember whether this waslocal or international travel but we made preparations to eliminatehim at the airport in Durban.   The arms were already preparedat that time because of the information received.   With a Kombiwhich I can no longer remember the model or colour, I can rememberthat there were curtains in front of the windows, we screenedthe inside of the Kombi with curtains and there was also a curtainin between the seat of the driver and the back of the vehicle.   Very early that morning we departed at a time I can no longerremember and I can no longer remember what time Father Makatshwawas supposed to arrive, we had his flight number and the timeof arrival.   We arrived in Durban, I can remember that we arrived...(endof side 2)...clear view of the main exit of the Durban airport.  At a certain point, Father Makatshwa who was very well knownto us, we saw him leaving the exit but he was, there were oneor two people in between us and him all the time, there was someor other woman and possibly two men, one or two men but I couldbe mistaken.   There was a woman in front of him all the time.  As they came closer to the</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>4. Kombi /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 307 J HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a>   Kombi we were parked in such a way that we had a clear viewwith which to shoot.   It was very dark inside the vehicle andas Father Makatshwa walked closer and became ever clearer, thiswoman was in between him and us all the time which meant thatwe could not fire on him.   Mr Van Vuuren who grew up on a farmwould have been the shot.   Subsequently when he had passed us,we decided that we would follow him to see if we could not eliminatehim along the road with an AK-47 rifle.  What happened however,was that he entered a particular vehicle, I cannot remember atall what kind of vehicle, what colour of vehicle or how many peoplewere in the vehicle, but I can remember that when you leave theairport, (apologies), you had a toll-road through which you hadto exit and where you had to pay.   The vehicle in which FatherMakatshwa was driving left through the toll-road and then a personbetween us and him had some trouble to find the ticket with whichto pay at the toll-gate and then Father Makatshwa drove off.  By the time we had paid to leave the toll-road, we could no longersee his vehicle, or it was no longer available.   We drove overa bridge and if I remember correctly, the bridge had a road goingtowards the South Coast, one to the North Coast and one to theblack township and we did not know in which direction Father Makatshwahad driven, so we decided that that would be the end of the matter.  We then took the North Coast road towards Durban and then</p>

<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>   we turned home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain who gave you the instruction to eliminateFather Makatshwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Captain Loots called us in at that time and GeneralBasie Smit was our Commanding Officer.   I was called in and toldthat it was decided that Father Makatshwa had to be eliminated.  Neither of them was there Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter, the question is when you receivedyour instruction, who was present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> My apologies Chair, Captain Loots gave me theinstruction directly claiming that it came from General BasieSmit and that it was to say that it was at that level.  CaptainLoots for the interest of it was my direct Commanding Officer,my immediate superior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter you also explained a furtherevent in your application, could you explain this to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At a later stage, the exact time is somewhatvague to me at this time, but I think it was early in the nextyear then Brigadier Smit gave instructions to myself and W/O PaulVan Vuuren calling us to his office, and being aware of our covertoperations, called us to his office and gave us instructions toplant a quantity of Mandrax tablets on Bishop, or on Father Makatshwaand that we had to force some down his throat so that it wouldappear as if he died from an overdose.   Myself and W/O Van Vuurenreturned to my office, discussed the matter, and decided thatat that time General Smit was new, he'd only been at the Branchfor a couple of months, and after the previous fiasco I did nottrust his approach, his modus operandi.   I discussed thiswith W/O Van Vuuren and told him that this might pass that</p>

<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 309 J HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a>we had to just wait and see what happened.   The passage of timedoes pose a problem but sometime later, possibly two weeks ora month I cannot remember exactly, I was called in or both myselfand W/O Van Vuuren were called in by General Smit or then BrigadierSmit and he asked me to what extent we had prepared in this regard.  I then told him that I did not think that I would want to continuein this kind of operation and that I don't want to be part ofthis game any longer.   There was a big explosion in the office.  The Brigadier was very angry to such an extent that he transferredme from this Unit to a unit known as the, this was a unit in whichwe had to decide which people were appropriate for the SecurityBranch and I, and Paul was made into a driver who had to lookafter General Smit and he had to look after his garden, work inhis garden whenever there was work necessary.    In this way ouroperations at the Security Branch came to a complete halt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter could this instruction havebeen carried out, realistically speaking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was highly unlikely since at great dangerto ourselves we would have had to intercept and kidnap FatherMakatshwa, we would then have had to force these pills with greatviolence down his throat.   Anyone with some experience knowsyou can't just push pills down someone's throat.   In my viewand out of my experience this instruction was not logically andrealistically possible and that's why I believe that this wasnot the right way to go about it.</p>

I have some technicalbackground and knowledge of firearms.   I decided that we wouldneed a 308 or a .22 rifle, depending on the circumstances.   Inthe case of close range it would be a .22 or 308 for a furtherdistance, we were not quite sure at that time of our preparationsat what distance we would have to fire.</p>

<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Remembering correctly, the AK-47 I can remember,it might have been that we also had our official police firearmspresent, a 9mm pistol, I couldn't swear that but I can swear withregard to the two rifles as well as the AK-47</p>

<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chair yes we could have used the AK-47 but doput yourself in our position, we are attempting to eliminate aman.   Had we shot him with the .22 then no-one would have knownfrom where we had shot because of the buffer on the firearm, wewould simply have been able to drive out calmly, like normal people,and no one would have imagined that the shot would have come fromour vehicle.   If, however, we had used the AK-47 then the policeat the airport would immediately have acted and most likely alsosome of the surrounding individuals, simply if only by runningtowards the scene and that would have made our escape possibilityso much more limited.</p>

<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The further away from one's own home this happened,the less likely it would have been for one to be caught out.  If we eliminated him right there, the investigation would havehappened right there and the possibility to link this to us inPretoria would have been less likely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...self and W/O Van Vuuren who went with youto Durban?</p>

<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>as well as his church, I know that he used to live next to thechurch and we visited him there.   I would have difficulty infinding, or rather would not be able to find the church again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...church premises, it's not next to the church.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I wouldn't be able to argue with you in thisregard, but if I remember correctly they would have been nextto each other.   If you tell me they were one building, I wouldbelieve that I wouldn't be able to argue with you in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You are not understanding one another, he issaying that the house is next to the church but in the same property.  There isn't two separate sites, it's a single erf with a singlesay fence around it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's exactly what I understood but I cannotremember whether there is a single fence around the two, I'm onlysaying they are next to each other, it could be like two houseswithout a fence in between.   I simply can't swear around it,it's too long ago.</p>

<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No but I did find young men in his house, butnot known activists.   We once found a firearm for which he didnot have a licence but at a later stage, two or three weeks later,we received a letter that he had the weapon for safekeeping.  Then, as I have already told you, we found this literature inhis house on communist activities, terrorism, counter-intelligence.  The conclusion I made, I</p>

<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No Mr Chair, it has already been testified thatwe never reacted on only the information we received from onesource, we always verified the information we received throughother sources.   We also had a churches' section like the blackpower section, the C section where the much talked about "Vlakplaas"resorted under, we also had the churches' section and they broughtit to our attention that Father Makatshwa was very much involvedin especially the schools' unrest, the consumer boycotts and thegeneral unrest in Soshunguwe.</p>

If I had to guess I would say that the Security Branchhad approximately 500 sources in the community.   I believe thatCol Loots could verify this or could correct me, but I don't thinkthere were any fewer than 500 informants.   These informants wereinfiltrated into various areas and they were tasked to monitorhigh figures and prominent activists for us, to attend meetingsand to come as close as possible to this specific target of ours,not specifically for elimination but only for monitoring them.  To come as close as possible to the person to be able to reporthis movements to us so that we could try to take preventive actionor to plan further</p>

<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As a member of the Security Forces it was not,we were not allowed to participate in politics actively, our participationwent as far as voting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...did you believe in the policies and theworkings of the National Party then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At that stage definitely, I definitely believedin it, I grew up with it and I stood by it.   The ANC and theSACP were my enemies, Cosatu and the UDF were my enemies as welland I fought them as far as I could.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Were you carrying them out on behalf of theSecurity Force or on behalf of the National Party.</p>

<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> General Smit was a new person in the branch,relatively a new person.   As in any organisation there were largerand smaller people and there were all sorts of rumours.   It waswidely known that General Smit was someone who easily steppedon those under him in order to rise in the organisation, I wasnot entirely happy at that time to</p>

<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you know at that time that General Smitplayed a role against certain policemen who were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At that time, it was just after the cases ofCaptain Le Grange and I believe Sgt Van der Merwe there were rumoursat that time with regard to all sorts of underhanded ways in whichthese persons were handed over.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe::</span> Don't suppose(?) my question, I'm sayingif you and Captain Hechter travelled in the same Kombi and ifthat Kombi's windows were blackened or darkened, both of you shouldhave known of that aspect not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I believe so Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe::</span> ...Captain Hechter never mentioned thefact that the windows were blackened out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I agree with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe::</span> ...but I believe when counsel said to usthat it may not be necessary to take this witness detail by detail,I think he did that in good faith trying to assist us as not toconsume time unduly and I think he was really saying in broadterms.   Unless the difference is of earth-shattering importanceI don't think it is fair to tax a witness on that, to look for,I'm not saying differences which are of importance must not beelicited, but I'm saying that one should bear in mind that thatcourse was adopted not as a way of trying to avoid the witnessfrom giving details, but as a convenient way of trying to dealwith an</p>

<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Thank you, I stand indebted Mr Chairman andmembers of the Committee.   Warrant Officer, before you couldgive evidence an application was made by your legal representativethat another offence or act or omission be added namely underthe Arms and Ammunition Act, what is that which you know thatyou have done that you are asking for amnesty for in regard ofthis offence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman may I, for the first timeduring these hearings, object to this question.   The witnessis not a legal expert, anybody who knows that Act knows exactlyhow many offences are contained in that Act, how technical theyare and it is surely unfair to ask the witness to answer specificallyto which specific offence he is applying for amnesty.   That iswhy it was stated in broad terms, offences in terms of the Armsand Ammunition Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> But if we are to grant amnesty we mustsurely know what specific offence he's asking for amnesty for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> That's the point, there's been no evidenceon that, it might have been appropriate had you led that bit ofevidence because right now none of us know what that particularoffence relates to, what incident, what date, where.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> I mean if you tell us, is it the AK-47,is it the 308, is it the 22?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes it deals with all three.</p>

Judge Wilson asked you about the sentence"a severe argument ensued between Captain Hechter and GeneralSmith" because Captain Hechter told General Smit that wecould not continue with the operation because we did not trusthim.   Was that sentence meant to, was the reference to Capt LeGrange and Sgt Van der Merwe were part of the operation and that'swhy you did not want to go on with the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, the reason was the way in which General Smitwanted us to perform the operation.   The problem regarding CaptainLe Grange and Sgt Van der Merwe was discussed between us.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Can I correctly address you as Reverend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Please do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Rev Mkhatshwa what is your occupation at thismoment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I am a Catholic priest but who also happens tobe a Deputy-Minister of Education.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Before being a Deputy-Minister of Education,were you in full-time services of the Lord as a Catholic priest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Before that what were you doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well I've always been, well after my ordinationto the priesthood, I've always been in the services of the Lord,I spent about 18 years in Shoshunguwe as a pastor and thereafterI worked at the Institute for Contextual(?) Theology for fiveyears until I was elected to Parliament in 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Reverend you were present in the hearing todayand the other days and you had the opportunity of reading throughthe application about you.   Do you have any comment to make onthis application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Very briefly Chairperson, I'm not going to commenton the two incidents that the applicants referred to for the simplereason that I heard this information practically for the firsttime today when I read the affidavits, so there is</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>4b very /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>MR MPSHE 327 S MKHATSHWA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>very little for me to say about that because I really didn't know.  All that I can say at this stage is that my Gods, my ancestorsare very powerful indeed and also thanks to the community becauseI would imagine that by and large I am still in one piece todaybecause of the support that I received from the community.   Ithink Captain Hechter has made reference to that, indirectly atleast.   What I would like to say very briefly, I would like torefer to the evidence that was given here referring to me as someonewho supported terrorism and communism and all the other "isms"that you can think of, which the apartheid regime totally hatedand was totally opposed to.   I just want to put the record straightand point out that I certainly was never a terrorist, whateverthat meant, neither did I keep terrorist literature in my house,in my library.  The fact that I did read literature that madereference also to say to Marxism and so forth that does not inany way make one a communist or even a Marxist for that matter.  I believe that in my profession, in my vocation as a priest,if I have to make effective ministry to the people of God, I needto be fully informed about the lives of my people, the sufferingsof my people and other nations that found themselves in a similarsituation.   That I also needed to be informed about economicand political issues generally and that is the reason why I hadto read as broadly as possible otherwise it becomes very difficultto minister, meaningfully, to the people of God.   Let me alsojust say very briefly that when I came in here the first time,which I think was the Thursday or Friday when the hearings waspostponed, when I moved into the hall and saw the five gentlemenfor the first time and when Captain Hechter stood up and stretchedout his</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>4b hand /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a>MR MPSHE 328 S MKHATSHWA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a>hand I had ambivalent feelings.   The first feeling was one ofuncertainty, of hesitation but also of deep scepticism, for thesimple reason that the last time I think when Captain Hechterand I met he had a gun in his hand pointed at my forehead.   Doorswere broken down, that's how he, Capt Loots and others gainedentry, but that's not an issue for me now, but I'm just sayingthat that was my first response when he stretched out his hand.  In the same time, because of my deep-felt belief as a Christian,but because also of the policy of the Government of National Unity,the main emphasis on reconciliation and building a new nation,my second sentiments immediately said to me stretch out your handand meet Captain Hechter.   I shook hands with all the other gentlemenand for me it was a very strange feeling.   Also when I, I hopethis is not relevant Chairperson I'm just trying to put the thingin context, but also when I saw Brigadier Cronje I also rememberedbecause they made reference to the church having been membersof their church and so forth, I remember an incident when he andhis troops of 25, 30 of them stormed into my house, early as usual12:30 or 1 o'clock in the morning, forced me to, at least frog-marchedme into my church with their hats on, smoking, and I said veryclearly I remember I said to Brigadier Cronje you may not haverespect for me as an individual, that's your democratic right,but as a Christian you ought to respect the house of God.   Beforethey left the church, they forced me to open the tabernacle whichthey threatened to blow up.   Those of you who are Catholics youknow what a tabernacle is, and how we regard that.   Finally asa compromise I opened it myself and they looked inside and theydidn't find what they thought they would find.   There</p>

<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a>again I shook his hand, I took his hand and I said as long asthe five gentlemen are now prepared to help all of us to builda new country, to take the issue of social justice very seriously,no longer just as rhetoric but as something that all of us haveto work for based on the spirit and policy of reconciliation,I say I'm prepared to take his hand and not to doubt his bonafides.   So these are just a few comments I wanted to makeChairperson so that in other words I'm saying that I'm not goingto refer to other incidents that happened which probably thesegentlemen may not have been informed or maybe not have been awareof because then I would be in a much better position actuallyreally to testify to something that I personally experienced,even though I was blindfolded and all the rest of it, somethingI could say something much more concrete about that.   We arejust dealing here with the situation of incidents that I was notaware of but only just say a few words in very broad terms aboutthe situation that existed and my attitude.   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Reverend do I understand you to be saying thatby shaking hands with the gentlemen you sort of accept their forgiveness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes Chairperson, my assumption, I'm putting itvery carefully, my assumption is that this is not just an exercisein trying to qualify for amnesty, that there is a genuine desireon the part of the five gentlemen to show repentance for whatthey have done, but also to go further because as Mr Tibedi pointedout, that what is even much more important is something that needsto be done in terms of reparation beyond this exercise here.  By reparation I'm not really spelling out exactly what form thatcould take,</p>

<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a>I personally as an example would be delighted if one day, oneSunday, Captain Hechter, W/O Van Vuuren would go to my congregationthat I have served for 18 years in Shoshunguwe and for them tosay to the people there that yes we certainly are genuinely sorryabout what happened.   We are the people who made the life ofyour priest, your pastor, hell, for me that...(end of side 2)...especiallyto the victims, especially to those who suffered even worse thanourselves.   As an example for instance, if Captain Hechter andhis colleagues perhaps could pay their school fees, I'm just makinga suggestion, an example, I'm not saying that they should necessarilydo that, spare the school fees of one of the children of theirvictims who may be going to school these days.   It's just asan example.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Reverend we know perhaps knowing this, we havethat arrangement in the form of a rehabilitation and reparationcommittee that is taking care of.   Is that all that you wantedto say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that's all.   As I say, I was talking aboutthem as individuals not just the State doing certain things onbehalf, that's really what I'm really talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> You've come here to give evidence about twoincidents of which you knew nothing about until you read the papersthis morning, is that it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Well now, since you are here and since thesegentlemen are here, are you aware of any other incidents whichthey have not talked about in which you may have been involvedor implicated?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a>was abducted, abducted by two gentlemen that I really don't knowbecause I was blindfolded, handcuffed and driven to an unknownplace because I couldn't see it and I was kept there for two daysand I was abused and tortured continuously.   Now I can only guessthat when certain questions were put to me during the interrogation,I can almost suspect that perhaps certain voices might have belongedto some of these gentlemen, but that is really almost irrelevantin the sense that that is guesswork because you just asked aboutincidents generally.   It may well be that they might have beeninvolved in those incidents, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Apart from that incident there is no otherspecific occurrence which, to your knowledge, one of the applicantsor all of them were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not to my knowledge Chairperson except just toadd again that I think Captain Hechter was quite correct in sayingthat he visited, he and his colleagues visited me at the usualungodly hour very early on the morning on more than three occasionsand certainly at that time I must say I got an impression, rightlyor wrongly, that Captain Hechter in particular almost hated mewith a passion because of the way in which he behaved towardsme during those incidents.   But apart from that I'm not awareof any other incident in which they were specifically involved.</p>

Mr Mkhatshwa, FatherMkhatshwa I beg your pardon, you probably have seen the flurryof reaction amongst the applicants when you mentioned the interrogation.

They have instructed me to say to youthat as far as, according to their knowledge, military intelligencewas involved in that incident and that it had to do with an actionyou instituted against the South African Defence Force.   Thatis as far as I can enlighten you in respect of that.   They havegiven me instructions to tell you that it wasn't them and thatthey weren't involved in that specific abduction and interrogation.  Father Mkhatshwa I must also say that when you spoke about yourreaction to the applicants when they stretched out their handsto you, I actually felt that every South African in this roomwho heard those words from you can seriously believe that thereis a chance for reconciliation in this country.   I want to sayto you specifically, and I say that on behalf of all five of theapplicants, that they have a genuine intention and wish to havereconciliation in this country.   They have the utmost respectfor you for what you have said now here in this room, and thatthey will be prepared to discuss with you possibilities raisedby you in respect of reparation and in respect of for instancevisiting the congregation.   I say that on behalf of all fiveof the applicants and I want to ask you one last question FatherMkhatshwa, in the light of what you said, do you accept that theapplicants are before this Committee, after you've heard the evidencefrom the start and after you've heard the opening statement ofthe applicants, do you accept that the applicants are before thisCommittee bona fide and honestly in a search for the truthand for reconciliation?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a>reason to doubt their bona fides, however, let me alsopoint out that as a member of the African National Congress weare also handling the question of amnesty, reconciliation in adefinite particular way, but it is certainly in a very positiveway.   It is a commitment to making sure that reconciliation,genuine reconciliation becomes a reality.  So my attitude is (1)openness and readiness to genuinely accept a brother, a sister,as fellow South Africans who says from now onwards I'm preparedto actively and genuinely begin to work for the building of anew nation, for a new country that is qualitatively differentfrom the old.  In fact, I'm prepared to be actively involved inthe ongoing struggle against any legacies of apartheid, becauseit was apartheid, it was the system that reduced fellow humanbeings into almost killer machines.  We are therefore saying ifreconciliation is to really mean anything at all, if it will havecontent, we must make sure that that system dies and is buriedpeacefully - maybe not so peacefully but that it is dead and buried.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Thank you Father Mkhatshwa.   I may just mentionthat part of my argument will be that the applicants, and thatwas part of the opening statement and the evidence, that the applicantswere drawn into this whole system by the way they were broughtup, by the way they were taught certain beliefs, by the way theywere subject to propaganda and by the way they were dealt withby the N G Kerk.   I am glad that you made that statement thatwill form part of my argument at the end of these hearings.  Thank you very much.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a>R U L I N G</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> At the commencement of these proceedings lastweek, Mr Du Plessis, who appears on behalf of the applicants,applied to the Committee for an order calling upon the State witnesses,Captain Van Jaarsveld and Sergeant  D Gouws,  Warrant OfficerOosthuizen and Warrant Officer J Mamasela,  by notice in writingto appear at this hearing and to give evidence or to answer questionsrelevant to the subject matter before us.  This was to be in accordancewith section 29(1)(c) of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, No 14 of 1995.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a> A criminal trial is pending in our Supreme Court against fourof the applicants and the abovementioned persons are known tobe State witnesses in that trial. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a> The Committee was also requested to call upon the Attorney-Generalof the Transvaal in  terms of  section 29(1)(b) of the Act, tohand over the dockets  of the inquiries made by the  Attorney-Generalin respect of the applicants and the criminal trial. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a> It is convenient to deal with the latter request first.  It was submitted that the Attorney-General's docket contained certainstatements by State witnesses and  that these  would be of a materialimportance to the applicants in the application and it would assistthe Committee in obtaining the whole truth. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a> Section 29(1)(b) gives the Committee a discretion which it mayexercise if, in its opinion, the contents of the Attorney-General'sdocket  are  relevant to the subject matter of this hearing. On the information placed before us we cannot say that the contentsof the dockets contain</p>

<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a>336 RULING</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a>material relevant to the subject matter of the  present hearing. In fact, no information whatsoever was advanced as  to what they may contain apart from information relating to the pending prosecutionagainst the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a> Because of this  it  is  not  possible for the Committee to forman opinion that its contents, namely the contents of the docketare relevant for the present hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a>This application can  therefore not succeed. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a> In respect of the first application, the one to subpoena Statewitnesses, it was submitted that  it  is  reasonable, necessaryand justifiable in an open and democratic society based upon freedomand equality that  witnesses who could provide material informationand corroboration of the truth of the applicants' applications,should not be prohibited to give evidence.  The Truth Commission forms part of the democratic South  Africa. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a> The Committee was requested to exercise its discretion  in termsof section 31(2) of the Act, which deals, inter alia, withthe compellability of witnesses.  It was  argued by counsel  forthe applicants that even State witnesses, namely the witnessesin the pending criminal trial, might be called to appear at thishearing and be compelled to answer questions provided that  there has been consultation with the Attorney-General as required bysection 32(2)(a) and that the Committee has satisfied  itselfthat to require such information from State witnesses is reasonable,necessary and justifiable in  an open and democratic society basedon freedom and equality as provided in section 32(2)(b).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a> It is argued that there is no provision in the Act which excludesState witnesses from the ambit of this Act,</p>

<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a>337 RULING</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a>Mr Du Plessis said, that his clients were committed totell the truth at this hearing and that if the State witnessesare ordered to give evidence at this hearing their evidence, ifthey are truthful, will corroborate the applicants' case for thegrant of amnesty. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a> The  Attorney-General's representative strenuously opposed theapplication on the obvious ground that the State  case againstthe applicants in the pending trial might be considerably impairedand compromised if State witnesses are  compelled to answer questionsat this hearing.  Their answers will afford applicants advanceknowledge of the evidence which they will face at their trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a> In the light of the  attitude of the  Attorney-General, therehas to be other compelling reasons before an order can be  made. As things stand at present, no information is placed before usto indicate the nature of the evidence which the applicants hopeto obtain from the State witnesses.  All we have is a vague expressionof belief that the evidence of the State witnesses will offersome corroboration to the applicants in their evidence in thishearing.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a> The Committee does not feel persuaded by the argument advancedon behalf of the applicants.  The application to subpoena theState witnesses is therefore refused. </p>

<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, as I haveindicated to the Committee members in Chambers, the matters thatwe are going to deal with this morning, we are going to commencewith the third one, that is Makope, Maake and Sefola killings,Mr Chairman.  But I was approached by my colleague yesterday,Mr Brian Currin, that he would wish first to recall Brig Cronje,for cross-examination.  That I leave to the discretion of theCommittee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, perhaps I could just alludeto that.  Mr Currin approached me as well in this regard.  Hewill address the Committee on the reasons therefor.  I can saythat we do not particularly have a problem with that, except thefact that Brig Cronje is then going to be called piecemeal.  Thiswill be the second time that he will testify.  He will be takenthen under cross-examination in respect of the general background,and then when he testifies again later on on his specific incidents,he will be taken under cross-examination again, and we feel thatthat is dealing with it piecemeal, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> Mr Chairman, maybe I can just motivate ourapplication to recall him for cross-examination.  The cross-examinationof the applicants in regard to specific incidents will largelybe informed by the general background and the general motivationthat was provided by Brig Coetzee when he testified on behalfof all the  applicants.  In that motivation a lot was said aboutpolitical motive and about political objectives and the context. The questions that  we put to individual applicants should notonly be informed by his evidence in chief, but also his totalevidence in</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a>1A regard/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a>MR CURRIN 339 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a>regard to that submission.  We have a number of questions whichwe would like to  put to him which we believe will help to fleshout some of the ambiguities and uncertainties about certainlyour clients and we feel regarding that evidence.  He is the personthat testified on behalf of the applicants so we would like tocross-examine him.  We realise that his testimony was on behalfof all the applicants, which means that if any applicant wereto testify in regard to any of the incidents, and if one wereto start now with the Makope, Maake and Sefola killings, we wouldbe entitled to cross-examine those particular applicants regardingthat general evidence as well, but they didn't give the testimony,so we believe it would be right and correct to rather cross-examinethe person who gave that testimony.  So that is really the reasonwhy we would like to cross-examine him on that before we proceedon cross-examination on specific incidents. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Currin, it seems to be the view of the Committeethat we would not like to sets of cross-examination of a witnesswhere it can be avoided.  This is a lengthy matter.  There  willbe enough time to put all that you wish to put to Brig Cronjeon the general evidence and on anything that you have that isspecific which will emerge no doubt from the evidence given bywitnesses to test whether what he has said under his general evidence is correct or not.  So I think that it would be convenient forus to proceed on the basis that when Brig Cronje comes to giveevidence you will have all the  opportunity to test his evidencein that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> We accept that.  Can I just ask one questionfor clarification?  We would then like the first witness who</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a>1A testifies/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a>MR CURRIN 340 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a>testifies regarding these incidents under oath to confirm BrigCronje's testimony regarding the general background and  we willthen cross-examine him on that general background, if that's inorder. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Whether you wish to cross-examine him and thencross-examine Cronje again and so on, is a matter in which somejudicial discretion must be exercised.  We are not in a trialand cross-examination is not something which is unlimited, asyou no doubt know, and it may well be that you might have to curtailyour cross-examination of witnesses who are going to give evidenceon specific matters to those  matters.  Where evidence concerninggeneral behaviour of all the applicants is concerned, I thinkit would be prudent if  you did leave that to Brig Cronje simplybecause when the  proceedings started it was on the basis thatin order to save a great deal of time Brig Cronje would be allowedto give evidence on the general background.  And I think in  keepingwith that wish we would prefer it if we go along along those lines.  I am not going to prevent you from cross-examining individualson specific instances, but if there is any point which you thinkit particularly germane then you may ask that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> Thank you,  Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Then  I hand over tomy learned friend, Mr Chairman, to start with that matter of Makope,Maake and Sefola.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, may I make a request.  Myattorney and I have been discussing this possibility and the wholequestion of cross-examination on the general background.  Whatwe are a bit concerned about is that if  Mr Currin intends tocross-examine and has specific general</p>

<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a>questions, which he is going to ask each and every witness, weare not sure if it might not be prudent to have Brig Cronje testifyfirst. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Well, if anything like that does happen andif Mr Cronje is going to give evidence, as we have assured  counsel that he will, I do not  think  there need be any fear  that therewill  be very lengthy cross-examination  of each of the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Right, Mr Chairman, we don't really havea  problem.  We proceed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Maake was an informant for the SecurityBranch.  He was sent out and after three months he came back. He was questioned and he told us about his training.  LieutenantHechter drew up the report and sent it to the headquarters.  Accordingto him some of his instructions were from the police.  Maake alsospoke of Alistair Makudu(?) who would have assisted him with theplanting of a bomb at the head office of the Security Police inPretoria.  We determined this at a later point during the interrogationof Maake.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Captain Hechter and myself became scepticalabout the informant and no longer trusted him.  On occasion hesimply came to our offices without our having requested it.  Hisinstruction was particularly that he was not supposed  to cometo our offices as he was an informant.  We gained the notion thathe wanted to gain access to our offices.  He was not concernedabout his identity and we decided to interrogate him.  From adifferent informant's report we determined that he was a doubleagent for which reason we wanted to interrogate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I am afraid I didn't take down the name of thisperson who  was suspected to be a double agent.  What is his name?</p>

There was an operation planned with information available tohim to eliminate us.  The reason  of this was that we had a lotof information about ANC activists and had been a danger for them. Since  we had booked in under other names they were not ableto track us down.  During their interrogation it became clearthat his contact in Mamelodi was a certain Andrew Makope.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Van Vuuren, before having moved to this property, did you know that there would be such a generator atthe  property?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I knew that they used that generator forpumping water.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Please continue on page 99.  Did you usethis  property on many occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Yes, I grew up in that area.  I knew thearea very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> For what purpose did you use this propertypreviously?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> No, this was between the highway and theold Pienaarsrivier Road.  It was simply an open piece of mine property where the cattle were grazing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Van Vuuren, you've given testimony thatduring the interrogation it appeared that his contact in Mamelodiwas Andrew Makope and after you gained this  information fromhim what did you do next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> During the interrogation it became quiteclear that his contact in Mamelodi was Andrew Makope.  We drewMakope's file and determined that he was an activist and a courierof the ANC.  As far as I can remember, Freddie Legotke(?) wasan ANC member as well as an exile, a family member of Makope whowas living in Lusaka, Zambia at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Van Vuuren, did you leave Maake on theproperty when you drew the file or did you take him with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> No, we brought him with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Where exactly did you draw this file?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> We drew it at the Security Branch.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> The information which you gained from thefile with regard to Makope, could you expand on this for the Committeewith regard to acts in which Makope was involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Makope's file had to do with arms whichentered the country and that he kept terrorists in hiding or assistedterrorists with hiding in Mamelodi, that he hid their arms, thathe transported them around.  He was a logistics person for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Once you had this information available,what did you do next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> We decided to pick up Makope.  We immediatelywent to Mamelodi and started to watch Makope. It was myself, CaptainHechter, Sergeant Mamasela, Constable Hendrik Mukaba and ConstableDanny Tshihlahle, known as Slang, if I remember correctly.  Approximately10 o'clock that evening he entered his car which was indicatedto us by Maake.  We pulled him off the road and as far as I canremember he was driving a blue Colt Galant although I am not exactlysure about this.  We put  Makope  in our minibus and one of usfollowed with the Colt Galant.  I believe this was Sergeant Mamasela. We left Maake and Makope at the  property about 5km north ofthe Pienaarsrivier Dam and went home ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you stop there for a moment.  Youtook Maake and Makope to the same property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you then immediately interrogate Makopeor did you just leave him there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Until the next day.   We simply left him there until the next day.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you indicate to the Committee whatthe circumstances of Maake and Makope were, were  they tied  down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Yes, we tied their hands and legs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Could they lie down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Yes, they could lie down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did they have water?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> We left them both water and food.  If Iremember correctly, we bought this  food at the Pienaarsriviershop.  There is a little  restaurant there at the corner and webought some food there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> What would they have done with this foodand water if their mouths were closed and their hands were tieddown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> We left Sergeant Mukaba and Sergeant Tshilahlewith them to help them with the water and food.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Were they inside or outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> They were outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> (Question inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is correct.  I must mention that therewas a small kind of zozo-hut which they were able to stay in butwhen Captain Hechter and myself left the property they were inthe open veld.  Captain Hechter gave instructions that Slang andHendrik had to keep the prisoners inside the hut at a later stageafter they had eaten.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Where did you go after this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> We went home.  The next morning we wentback  to the property.  At dawn Hechter, Mamasela and myself returnedto the property.  We interrogated Makope in the same way we interrogatedMaake, that means we also gave him electrical shocks with thegenerator approximately three  or</p>

<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a>four times.  His interrogation also took roughly an hour.  Makopequickly made all the facts available.  He told us that he wasMaake's linking person and that their head was  a certain Braach(?)who lived in Witbank.  He said that Braach was the person whogave the instructions. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you stop there for a moment.   Whatexactly did Makope admit to you with regard to acts and actionsin which he was personally involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I cannot exactly remember any more.  Ican  remember what kind of acts Mr Sefola was involved in butnot Mr Makope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> You may continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Makope said that Braach was the person who gave the instructions and Makope said that Legotka had adifficult time in Lusaka and Zambia, that he had to make clothesto stay alive and that his monthly ... (BEGINNING OF TAPE 1B)... and that he was responsible for the transport of arms andthat he received his instructions from Harold Sefola.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you remember at all whether he admittedto be involved in acts of terror?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I cannot remember whether he was physicallypersonally involved with acts of terror, but that he did indicatetargets and serve as a courier for arms.  That I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> After you received this information, whatdid you do next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> We left these two that very day and returnedto the Security Branch offices.  Because of the fact that Makopeinformed us that Sefola was the person who gave instructions withregard to which targets had to be attacked</p>

<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 349 J J VAN VUUREN</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a>and also the fact that he provided housing and assistance to activistsand terrorists who returned to the Security Branch.  I went toSecurity Branch Head Office.  I must explain here that I had togo to the head office because Witbank was outside of our own area. If it was true that Sefola was the big terrorist and activist, I had to receive his file from the head office because we wouldonly have had files in our branch office of those in our area. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Van Vuuren, when you left  them there,was this at the property where you had interrogated them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is correct.   We left them at thatvery property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you leave anyone with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> We left Constables Makaba and Tshilahlewith  them again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> What information did you obtain from thefile at Security Branch Head Office with regard to Sefola?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I left the Security Branch Head Officewhere I drew Sefola's file and it became clear from the file thatSefola was a very big supporter of the ANC and activist and organiserand a trained terrorist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you remember any additional information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> This is very long ago.  In the file theyspoke of his involvement with limpet mine explosions and thathe might have given instruction for the death of a policeman inMamelodi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> What did you do next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That night Mamasela, myself and Hechterwent  to Witbank.  We used two vehicles.  Hechter and myself waitedoutside Witbank on the main road and Mamasela went ahead on hisown.  I must mention here that with regard to</p>

<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 350 J J VAN VUUREN</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a>Tshilahle he might have been with us and that only Mukaka mighthave been left with the other two, but I am not sure about this. After about two hours he returned with Sefola.  He presentedhimself to  Sefola as an ANC terrorist who had  been sent fromoutside the country and that there were other persons whom Sefolawas supposed to meet.  This is how he had convinced Sefola tocome with him in the vehicle. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> After Sefola was in the vehicle, wheredid you take him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> We returned to the property to the northof the Pienaarsrivier.  We also interrogated Sefola in a similarmanner as the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you remember how many times you gavehim electrical shocks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Between five and 10 times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> What information did he give you with regardto acts of terror in which he was involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> He had admitted after he was interrogatedthat he was an organiser of the ANC in the area with a seniorposition.  He admitted that he provided housing for ANC activistsand terrorists and did target analysis for them.  Sefola alsospoke, although I cannot remember the names exactly, of a certainPhula or Phule as well as A Mnisi.  He admitted his involvementin bombings, limpet mine  explosions and that he was responsiblefor the planning of  all of these incidents.  He admitted to beinga trained terrorist and he provided us with the names and addressesof his own cell as well as other terrorists.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> No, I can no longer remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Were Maake and Makope also trained terrorists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I can mention that Maake had been sentoutside of the country for training as I had mentioned  at  thebeginning.  I would suppose that  Makope  must  have been trainedinside the country if he was a member of this cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> What was the response of Sefola when youinterrogated him, did he give you the information easily?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Sefola was a strong person.  He believeddeeply in that in which he was involved in and of its correctness.</p>

He asked if he couldsing N'kosi Sikelela Afrika and he said that we had better killhim.  He also claimed that the ANC would govern  later, that apartheidwould no longer be able to be maintained and that a democracywould be the end of the Boers.

<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Why did you do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> To obtain more information from Sefola.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a>explosions where people died.   He admitted his involvement withone of the landmine incidents where people died.  There was ageneral state of emergency and unrest, rebellion, arson and murderall over the country.  If we had caught them the network wouldsimply have changed.  It was necessary to kill them in order todestroy the entire cell.  No one knew what had happened to them. After this we blew them up with a landmine so that it would beimpossible to recognise them.  This was on a road in Bophuthatswanaclose to Warmbaths.  This action was directly due to the generalinstruction of Brig Johan Viktor to sort out problems becausethe country was going up in flames.  It was additionally underthe instructions of Brig Cronje.  The purpose was to neutralisethe cell.  We did not enjoy doing this, we did not want to dothis, but we had to stop them  from killing innocent women andchildren.  It was additionally necessary to do this because wewere at war with the ANC.  I have tremendous respect for HaroldSefola because of the way in which he behaved during the process of us killing him. </p>

<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> The purpose of this action was to counter the ANC and other liberation movements who were involved in arevolutionary onslaught against the apartheid government.  Themotive of the act was to counter terrorism, advance security anddefend the country.  A further motive was to eliminate activistsand terrorists so that additional information which would havebeen to the disadvantage of the State and security forces notto have become available beyond them.  The context within whichthis occurred was against the background of a state of emergencyas well as unrest, violence and intimidation on a daily basis. The ANC and other liberation movements attempted to make thecountry  ungovernable at that time as part of the political resistance.  The purpose and goal was to eliminate ANC supporter/activistsor terrorists.  After information was  gained by means of interrogationit was necessary to eliminate these three terrorists in orderto destroy the entire cell and with regard to trained terroristsinvolved  in the death and assault on innocent people to causethem to stop from their actions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> It was necessary to eliminate activistssince the information gained from them during interrogation hadto be protected.  The identity of the informants and sources ofthe Security Police had to be protected.  If activists and terroristsafter providing information would have been arrested, then theinformation,  routes of the freedom fighters and activists wouldhave changed so that the Security Police would not have been ableto use the information.  When activists intended going outsidethe country for training they had to be eliminated to preventthat they would destabilise the land and its people at a laterstage by means of acts of terrorism, such as bombing attacks againstboth the security forces and soft targets.

<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is untrue.  He was an informant ofthe Security Branch.  We took him to the border ourselves where we dropped him the first time when he went into Botswana alongthe powerlines.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a>No, I can just explain how it worked at the Security Branch. Me, Captain Hechter and Mamasela, if I may say the word, werebasically the hit squad of the Security Police in that area. And we also had our own normal activities with which we went on. Amongst others, Maake was our informant,  in other words, inour normal security network, he was involved  with us.  </p>

Captain Hechter and I after we made a caravailable to him and after he came back from training, and thetechnical department of Security, built a false compartment intothe car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> If I can just interrupt here.  The questionasked to Warrant Officer Van Vuuren relates to an incident whichwe regard as an incident which has got nothing to do with theamnesty applications and his evidence  pertaining to this mightincriminate him in respect of a certain action which doesn't formpart of this amnesty application.  So I would request the Committeeat this stage that he doesn't give evidence pertaining to thisspecific question about the licence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is he now concealing information from this Committee?  Is that what his intention is, not  to be frank withus?   I am just asking you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> No, the only point I am making, Mr Chairman,is that he is going to incriminate himself in respect of an  offencewhich he hasn't asked amnesty for which we don't regard as anoffence that he can ask amnesty for, and I believe the Act insection 30 makes provision for this situation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> The evidence relates to the method in whichthey obtained the licence.  He didn't go through a test, Mr Chairman,they obtained the licence by way of a procedure and an arrangement.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> I accept that.  I just question the fact thatyou say categorically that he never mentioned Makope's name before,but yet there was a file.</p>

During your testimony youdidn't repeat at all your evidence which is in writing on pages111 and 112 and 113.  That evidence relates to the purpose oftorture, of interrogation and torture.  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I don't understand  the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> In your application on pages 111 to 113 youdeal with the purpose of interrogation and torture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> ... refer to that ...  (rest inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> It is all evidence, as I understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> I just wanted to know whether there was anyreason why, from the witness, why that evidence was not read ontothe record.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> In the context of that question,  I would liketo ask you why you deem it necessary to kill Maake and the reasonwhy I asked the question is because there is a motivation forkilling people that you torture.  And one of  the important reasonsis so that person that you've tortured who gleans informationthrough being tortured about  other informants and about the SecurityPolice activity, would</p>

<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a>then be a threat to you.  He already knew all of that information- sorry, that informant would become known to other informants. Maake was already an informant.  He had nothing more to revealto anybody.  He didn't  learn anything more from the interrogationabout the activities   of the Security Branch and other informants. So why was it necessary to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I have  already said that we  thought thatMaake was a double agent after the interrogation and having identifiedMakope, who brother was a trained ANC terrorist in Lusaka, wecontinued with the interrogation.   We were no longer able totrust him.   He was an arms courier and with regard to Sefola,who was the kingpin of this entire cell, and was involved withlimpet and landmine explosions and the death of police officersin Mamelodi and the use of landmines in Mamelodi.  Maake was involvedin the activities of this cell.  He was one of the pawns in thiscell and that is why we decided to eliminate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> ... collected Makope and taken him for interrogationin this open lot on the premises of PPC, and  you said it wason the premises of PPC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> Maybe before I get to that.  How did you gainaccess to those premises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I grew  up in that area and as a boy Ioften shot game there.  There were 4-foot wires but there wasalso a gate I can go in through.   There was no security.  PPCdid not know anything about it at all.  If you knew how to getin there you could only drive in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> Why did you follow the procedure of interrogationand then leaving them there and going home and</p>

<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> We first had to go and find out whetherthey were talking the truth because they could give us names of people who did not even exist.  That's why we  went back everytime to find out.  At the main office we looked into the filesand found out if it was really true and what was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> You said that Maake told you about his involvementin terrorist deeds and so on.  Have you any specific recollectionof what he was involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> He brought terror arms into the countrywith the vehicle we organised for him and those weapons we neverreceived.  He said that he never brought weapons in but duringthe questioning he did say that he brought weapons into the countryand he handed it over to Makope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> ... originally interrogated him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Never.  When he came back from traininghe never said that he brought weapons into the country.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I can only say that we treated them humanely.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> It is untrue that he would have died fromstarvation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> This was the first time that you had interrogatedMakope, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> If one looks at the motivation as to why youinterrogated as part of your  written application, you say thatone of the reasons why we interrogate and torture is to intimidatethe particular activist into refraining from continuing with hisactivities.  Why didn't you rather  use that as an exercise here. It is now the first opportunity, you've never interrogated himbefore, he is plucked out of his home in Mamelodi, why didn'tyou try and make an informer out of him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Your Honour, these people were involvedin landmine explosions, limpet mine explosions, death of policemen. At that stage it was a total onslaught.  It was very difficultto find informants to work for the Security Police and the policemenhad to stay at home to look after their houses.  The people'swar was getting stronger and  stronger and we had to act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> ... what we've been told previously.  We'vebeen told that there were many, many informants.  And in fact,yesterday the number of 500 was mentioned just within that  region.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That's the truth.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> ... to get informers.  I don't understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I can only explain by saying that it becamemore and more difficult to get informants.  It was initially veryeasy but it became more and more difficult.  As the people's warwas continuing it became more and more difficult.  People fearedfor their lives and  they were scared because if it was foundout that they were informants, they were necklaced the followingday and their families were killed.  It became more difficultto get informants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> But it was information for you.  You stillendeavoured ....(intervention.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That's correct, but I can only say thatthe ANC worked in cells.  There are approximately 5 to 8 peoplein one cell and the one cell did not know about the other cell. To try and get Mr Makope to be an informant to get six or sevenpeople's names was not worth the trouble.  We did not try to gethim as an informant, only to get those six or seven names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> And persuade him to become an informant wasbecause he had committed terrorist deeds.  I don't understandthat in the light of what constitutes an Askari.  These are peoplewho were part of the struggle, they were involved in terror deeds,but they were interrogated and they were persuaded to become informants. Why not in this instance?  And the reason I put the questionto you is that you had power of life and death over these threeindividuals and I am putting it to you that one really has tochoose between a few evils and I am questioning why you didn'tfirst try an alternative evil into persuading them to become informants and persuading them to assist you in the course</p>

<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Your Honour, I can only say that Mr Makopeand Mr Maake were in a specific cell and the moment we gainedthem as informants, the struggle was at that stage very serious.  The moment we  gained them as informants  the chances wouldhave been very good that they could tell Sefola and that he couldtell others that they were now informants.  We did not try torecruit them;  they were  involved in very bad crimes and we didnot try to recruit them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> ... Sefola as well, why didn't you also tryand convert him to become an informant, rather than kill him inthe first instance?  First you try and intimidate him.  Afterall, you said that was the purpose of interrogation and torture. Secondly, to try and convert him to become an informant,  whydidn't you do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Please try and ask one question at a time. I think the witness has difficulty in answering a whole  paragraph.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Somebody who was involved in landmine explosionsand limpet explosions is committed to the cause.  It is impossibleto convince him to stop with his deed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> It is usually  the way in which Mr Mamasela acted.  I knew him very well.

<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Is this when he dies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> Both.  When you give a shock that doesn't killand maybe you can tell us also when it does kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> If I remember correctly, when you are givinghim such an electrical shock to kill them, the electrical generatorwas switched on and their bodies convulsed and their eyes closed. If we only switched  it on and off during interrogation, withthe purpose of interrogation, they simply screamed, well, theyonly screamed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> With regard to Sefola, your evidence was thatyou'd ascertained that he had been involved in limpet mines, thekilling of a policeman and a number of other terrorist  deeds. Had he ever before been arrested and/or detained as an activist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I cannot remember exactly.  What I canremember is that I drew his file at head office.  It was stillon computer,  they printed it out for me, it was a very thickfile, and in this file it said what he did.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a>Sefola was outside of our area, he was in the Eastern Transvaalregion,  so I cannot tell you exactly what all stood in the file,but what it did contain is that he admitted to us subsequentlythat he was the person who gave  instructions, MK members wouldenter the country, go to his home and he would then give theminstructions.  He would analyse the targets.  He would for instancetell them to plant a limpet mine in Checkers because he  wouldsee there is a lot of people there or very little police or whateverthe reason might be.  That's how it worked in his case, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> ... indicated that he had been involved inmany  previous terrorist activities, but you couldn't ascertainfrom the file whether he had ever been arrested or detained before?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> When you spoke about accessing informationabout him a moment ago, you said they pulled the information upon  computer and then put it into writing for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is correct, that is how it worked at head office.  If I came from a different section, such asfor instance Northern Transvaal branch, he was outside of ourarea, he was in the Eastern Transvaal.  I would then approachthe head office or go to the head office, I would give them hisname and they would then use his name and his area as far as wecould determine it from Maake and Makope and they would then drawthe file from the computer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> You said that the file was only in writing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> Has that database, has that also been destroyed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> In 1989 I left the service of the SecurityPolice.   As far as I have been able to ascertain from ColonelPhilip Loots, and as he told me, there was an instruction fromhead office that all files concerning activists and all the computerinformation had to be destroyed.

The ANC used this to  protect themselves so that if one of themdid happen to be captured or was interrogated, then only thatcell would be able to be destroyed while the other cells wouldbe able to continue with their operations.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I can only say that I was a Security Policeman,we were not normal police officers.  We were the political police,one could say.  We were to fight against  the ANC.  We did notdo normal policing tasks in which we</p>

We were Security Police, we wenton course, on security courses.   We were trained to fight againstthe ANC with everything we had in our power.  We  were trainedon hand grenades, we were trained to jump from buildings withclimbing equipment, we had intensive training.  Not only practicaltraining, but also academic training which showed us what thepurposes of  the ANC were and we were told that this was the so-called"rooi gevaar", the communist threat.  I believed inwhat I did, I believed that I was doing it for my country andmy people.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> ... waging the war you understood that thelaws of the land, whether it be the emergency regulations, the Police Act, the Internal Security Act, did not apply to you. You were entitled to kill the enemy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> No, the laws also were valid in my case, but as the total onslaught became more and more serious and aswe received instructions from the top and as we were told thatwe had to combat these people with everything in our   power,even if that meant that we had to kill people, that  we had todo this.    At that time I was proud of what I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> ... to disregard the law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is not what I am saying.  I want tore-emphasise, our instructions came to eliminate these persons,to get rid of them because of the intensifying of the People'sWar and we were therefore told that we were to carry out certainclandestine operations which Captain Hechter and myself and Mamaselawere tasked as a team to carry out these clandestine operations.

<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> ... understand the logic in your answer.  Areyou saying the killings in this particular instance were lawfulkillings?]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I would not claim that.  It would neverhave been lawful to kill people, but in the context of the thenwar we as Security Police officers attempting to combat the ANC,this became a means to an end.  We combatted the ANC with everythingin us.   We were never repudiated when we killed people and whenit was unlawful we should have been taken to court.   There weremeans by which to get rid of evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> But I don't understand your answer to Mr Currin's previous question.  He said that the way you understoodyour instructions, were you to do anything, whatever you feltyou could do, even if that could be against the law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That's how I understood my instructions. Even if it was against the law, I was allowed to act in that way.  I don't mean to say that this was right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> I just want to take you back before I conclude. You said that during your interrogation of Maake, on page 97,the last sentence in the long paragraph in the middle, that yougleaned evidence that there was going to be an attempt to tryand bomb the Security Police offices in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Maake told us that he worked with a LeicesterDumakudu and that they were going to plant a bomb at SecurityBranch Head Offices.   After we killed Maake my unit commanderand myself, that was Colonel Philip Loots, I told him what hadhappened.  He then said to me that he would take this up withthe official security of the building.  But that was long ago. I can't remember what  all we discussed in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> From page 113 onwards you deal with the generalmotivation.  I just want to say to you I am not going to ask youany questions regarding the general motivation at this stage. I will reserve that when I cross-examine Mr Cronje, and I justwould like to reserve the right to call you back in regard tothat general information at a later stage.  I have no furtherquestions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> We used a minibus of the Security Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> With whom was Makope in his car when you stoppedhim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I can't remember.  The white members ofthe Security Police didn't leave the vehicle.  If I remember correctly,it was only Sergeant Mamasela who got out of the vehicle and whoaccosted Makope, we refer to stealing a person, to robbing a personwhen we grabbed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... which gives one the impression that youmay have seen it was possible for you to see the occupants ofhis car, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is possible, but it was at night time. I cannot remember whether there was someone else in the vehicleor not.   Today I cannot remember.  If it  was a week after theevent I would have remembered, but I cannot any longer.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> To repeat, we used the generator.  Therewere two wires.

<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Still on the same page paragraph 2 your evidenceis to the effect that he made admissions as to his actions.  "AfterSefola gave additional information and made admissions that hewas involved in landmine incidents as well as the death of peopledue to that,  he was also shocked to death with the generator". At what stage did  he  make these admissions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> This was done before he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... as a senior person in the police force,didn't you think then that with these admissions a very successfulconviction would follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> No, Your Honour.  We would not be ableto put this person in a court.  How would we explain to the magistratewe gained these admissions?  There was no way in which we couldfind such a person guilty in a court.

<p class="line" id="line1753"><a name="pos1753"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> Yes, we in fact have now got a photograph available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1754"><a name="pos1754"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So is it possible to ascertain that youare talking about the same person or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1755"><a name="pos1755"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> We are not sure whether it is going to be possiblefrom the photograph, he was quite a lot younger at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1756"><a name="pos1756"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So you haven't got a photograph at aboutthat period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1757"><a name="pos1757"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> We have one when  he was two years younger,and obviously  16 to 18 does  make quite a big difference.  But,however, we thought it might  be  appropriate to ask the  applicantwhether he recognises the person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1758"><a name="pos1758"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And have any enquiries been made about thislicence?  Whether there is a photograph available in the records,presumably  ....(intervention).</p>

<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I will leave it for the moment.  And a finalquestion in this regard is, the  young man you were talking aboutwas at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> He was at school.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1767"><a name="pos1767"></a>obtained the printout  of the computer  file  dealing with MrSefola.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1768"><a name="pos1768"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That  is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1769"><a name="pos1769"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What was contained in that file confirmedwhat you had been told, it was the same information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1770"><a name="pos1770"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1771"><a name="pos1771"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So headquarters knew that he was a greatANC supporter, an activist, an organiser, a trained terrorist. That was all on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1772"><a name="pos1772"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1778"><a name="pos1778"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Not so, Your Honour.  We wanted to confirm simply that Mr Makope, when he implicated Mr Sefola, we want to confirm that such a Mr Sefola actually existed and that hewas this great ANC activist.  That is why I went to the head office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1779"><a name="pos1779"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... confirmed that.  I want to know why you suddenly decided to take action against Mr Sefola when theinformation was available to your headquarters and they had nottaken action.  Why did you do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1780"><a name="pos1780"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> This was after interrogating Mr Sefolaand  after he made certain admissions to us with regard to his acts.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1785"><a name="pos1785"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> This is correct.  This was reports frominformants on file at head office.  We could not ever prove thisin a court of law.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1808"><a name="pos1808"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I want to explain again.  At that timeI knew that area and it was the closest available place that cameto mind at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> ... the statement you made to us that initiallythere was no intention at all to kill these people.  Do you remembersaying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That was right at the start.  We only wantedto interrogate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> If there was no such intention to do that,then I don't understand why you had to take this person so faraway to so isolated a place.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> ... that initially the intention was notto kill Mr Maake.  When you picked up Mr Makope and later Mr Sefola,was the intention to kill each one of them already there, or didit come later?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> In your evidence you said that the firsttwo people - you must tell me if I misheard your evidence - yousaid Maake and Mr Makope were killed in order to make Sefola speak.  You said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is correct.   (BEGINNING OF RECORDINGON TAPE 3A)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> ... Mr Sefola to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> When we decided we were going to kill them,we decided that we would first kill Maake to gain more informationfrom Sefola.  That is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> I am saying that if Mr Sefola had givenyou the information you wanted, you would not have killed thefirst two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Not so.  By that time we had already decided that we were going to kill all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> ... you could realise whether or not Sefolawas willing to give information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> No, as I explained, we interrogated Sefola. After we interrogated him, we interrogated Maake and then  wekilled Maake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... interrogated Maake after Sefola?  Becauseyou've never mentioned that before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> No, that is not what I am saying.  WhatI am saying is that while interrogating Sefola, while Maake wassitting there, we decided to kill Maake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> I just want to clear this with you.  Ifthe purpose of killing the first two people was to cause Mr Sefolato speak, then I assume that the decision to kill them arose afteryou realised that Mr Sefola was not cooperative.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> No, Mr Sefola did cooperate.  This wassimply a part of our interrogation.  I can't tell you exactlywhy we did it in that way.  After we began interrogating him,after we've shocked him  with the generator, he began to cooperate. Because they were part of Mr Sefola's cell we did not want anyother persons, other innocent persons to be hurt by them, that'swe decided to kill them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> ... to reconcile that answer you've justgiven me, with what you said earlier on in chief and also to whatI've asked so many times, namely that the person of killing thefirst two people was to cause Mr Sefola to speak.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> That was also a purpose, though the intentionto kill the other two had already been - he had already arrivedat that intention, simply because they were part of a cell andyou had made up your mind you were going to destroy the cell. But you wanted Sefola to see first how his colleagues were killedso that he might answer your questions more readily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is in fact the case.  Just that whichhas been stated to me just now, that Sefola had to see how wekilled them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> ... was that the reason for killing wasthat  you wanted to exterminate the cell.  Are you agreeing tothat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> This was indeed the main reason.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1847"><a name="pos1847"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Mr Sefola was the leader of the cell andhe  gave the  information of the cell available to us so we knewwhere the other persons were.  As  I've explained, we knew wherethese other persons were, we knew what their names were, not necessarilyparticular addresses, but we had their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1848"><a name="pos1848"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> You told or it was put to you by Mr Mpshe  that, I believe it was Mr Makope, when he was picked up therewas a lady in the car, and your answer was that you could notrecall that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1871"><a name="pos1871"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Not so.  He was going to bring the armsinto the country, then the arms would have come to us and thenwe would have used these arms one way or another.   We would havebooby-trapped them and then we would have given it back to him,he would not have known of the booby-trap and he would then haveburied the arms to be picked up by ANC terrorists and then whenthey used the weapons it would have blown up in their faces.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> It usually worked in this way.  The informantwould at certain specified times, say, early in the morning, maybeat twelve o'clock at night, maybe late at night, the informantwould arrive at a particular place where his handler, the SecurityPoliceman who handles him, would then meet with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Were informants not expected at all to makea call at the Security Offices if they had urgent and relevantinformation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> No, for that purpose they had a phone number,the phone number of his handler, and he could phone that numberif there was some urgent matter.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> I would say that it happened over the courseof maybe two months, a month to two months, I am not quite sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> ... order to the informer to investigateMr Maake with regard to his double agency status?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Let me explain this.  Mr Hechter, Mr Mamaselaand myself worked in one corner of the offices.  I wouldn't beable to say how many, but there were about 200 staff persons onthis branch.  All of these were handlers of informants, some had10 informants, others had two informants.  Every morning Mr Hechterand myself would sit in a meeting with Colonel Loots, our CommandingOfficer.  The informant reports with regard to the most importantinformation out of the reports would have been given to ColonelLoots.  He would have written this down in a diary for the conferenceimmediately after that.  It was never my informant that gave thisinformation that Maake might be a double agent.  Nor can I rememberwhose informant it was.  In view of the clandestine nature ofthe operation we didn't ask whose informant gave the information. We were concerned about leaks out of the Security Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How did you come to be aware of this information? This is what you state in your affidavit.  You became suspiciousof this guy and your suspicion was later  confirmed on the reportsreceived from an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1915"><a name="pos1915"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is, as I have explained.  In the mornings,while everyone met, the previous days - with regard to what happenedthe previous day and night, this information would have been madeknown to us in this</p>

Colonel Loots knew whatwe were doing, and he then called us and told us that we had tobe careful because there was information that Maake was a doubleagent. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> When and where was the landmine obtainedthat blasted the three bodies of the activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1920"><a name="pos1920"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Through the activities of myself and CaptainHechter, we normally had explosives, landmines, AK47 rifles andso forth which we had available in our vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1921"><a name="pos1921"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are you saying that even though you had nointention initially to kill the three activists, you neverthelesscarried the bombs and the rifles and all kinds of ammunition? Was that the way you operated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1922"><a name="pos1922"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> Captain Hechter is an explosives expertand he usually had a large amount of explosives with him in thevehicle.  In the nature of the case he was called out to placeswhere bombs might have been and we then used these explosivesto get rid of this bomb or possible bomb.  Captain Hechter alwayshad explosives in the back of his vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1923"><a name="pos1923"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You've also given evidence that you had totie the feet of the activists during the interrogation and thefirst day of Mr Maake's interrogation he was left in the companyof, I think it is Warrant Officer Tshalela, and the other warrantofficer.  Were these people armed?  Were the security officersarmed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1924"><a name="pos1924"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> They were not warrant officers, they wereconstables, they were armed.  They had their usual 9mm pistolswith them.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> I just want to put it to you that from theinstructions we have from Elizabeth Maake, who is Jackson Maake'smother, she never ever saw him drive a motor vehicle, he neverever brought a motor vehicle home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1933"><a name="pos1933"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is untrue.  The vehicle was in MrMaake's possession for a considerable time.  I can't understandhow she can say that she never saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1934"><a name="pos1934"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> Mr Chairman, we have here copies of a photographwhich we have now discussed and have got permission from Mrs Maaketo hand it up to you and to show a copy of the photograph to thiswitness and to ask him whether he can identify Jackson Maake.

<p class="line" id="line1935"><a name="pos1935"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I think we should first find out whether weare talking about the same person before you start handing upthe photograph.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1946"><a name="pos1946"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE Ngoepe:</span> When was this photograph taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1947"><a name="pos1947"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> It was actually taken, according to our instructions,six months before he disappeared, not two years.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1949"><a name="pos1949"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> A general statement was made during cross-examinationwhich I think I may have misunderstood but I would like to justget clarity on what the witness said.  If I may ask one more question.  The witness spoke about a modus operandi as to what theydid with the arms and ammunition that in general terms were returnedto your office, and you said that you booby-trapped weapons andhid them away, planted them somewhere so that if an activist pickedthem up and used those weapons they would blow themselves up. Did I understand you correctly?  Is that what you did with armsthat came into your possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1950"><a name="pos1950"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I think he was talking about the arms that werebrought in by Maake from Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1951"><a name="pos1951"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> I just want clarity.  Is that what they did? They just booby-trapped them and hid them away and if they</p>

<p class="line" id="line1955"><a name="pos1955"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> No.  I never received weapons from Mr Maake. It was the modus operandi if an informant did bring weaponsin they were first brought to the offices of the Security Police,they were then booby-trapped, then they were given back to theinformant without his knowledge and he then went and buried it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1956"><a name="pos1956"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> They were buried for some unidentified targetto pick up and use and blow him or herself up, without knowingwho the potential target would be, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1957"><a name="pos1957"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> No.  If those weapons were buried, thepersons who later came in and used them they would know exactlywhere to find the weapons.  That is how the ANC worked at thatstage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1958"><a name="pos1958"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN:</span> If my son were to be playing in the field andhe were to find arms that have been hidden and he were to pickup something and see whether it worked, would he blow himselfup?  That is what I am trying to establish.  They were booby-trapped,hid in the field somewhere.  Anybody could find them, that iswhat I am trying to establish.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1959"><a name="pos1959"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> As I said, it was not the case that anybodycould find it.  Persons who later came in to find it, would knowexactly where to find it, but if the boy would have been to findit in the veld he could have been injured, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1960"><a name="pos1960"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I have some problem with this though.  AsI understand your evidence, this was part of the normal delivery. Maake brought weapons in, he would have</p>

Is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1964"><a name="pos1964"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That's what I am saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1965"><a name="pos1965"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Surely, once they get a batch of booby-trappedweapons, they are immediately going to blame your informant forthis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1966"><a name="pos1966"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> It is possible that they could blame him. That is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1967"><a name="pos1967"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... using your informant to possibly killsome people and possibly to get killed himself.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2052"><a name="pos2052"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I just want to place one thingon record, perhaps for purposes of Mr Currin.  And that is thatin respect of the general motivation under the "politicalmotivations", the general motivation has been included inrespect of eliminations and in respect of bombings, as I haveindicated, in every incident.  And that is the reason why I don'tlead that specific evidence.  I say that for purposes of Mr Currin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2053"><a name="pos2053"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I am sure he has understood that by now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2054"><a name="pos2054"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Van Vuuren, it was put to you by Mr Currinthat according to the mother Maake was a student.  And to a questionput to me earlier on you said that you did not know that he wasa student.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2056"><a name="pos2056"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Would that mean that you make use of somebody,if he was really your informer, you made use of somebody as aninformer without knowing what his occupation was?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2062"><a name="pos2062"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> That is correct.  Generally speaking, themore militant activists did not work.  How can I explain thisto you.  We made no attempt to find out what work they did.  Weonly wanted to gain information from them.  We were interestedin information concerning the struggle, not about their work.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2080"><a name="pos2080"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN VUUREN:</span> We determined from the file where Mr Sefolaworked and where he lived.  If I remember correctly, we also provideda photograph to Mr Mamasela of Mr Sefola.  Mr Mamasela was a verywell-trained operative.  Since Mr Sefola was a very active activistit was not difficult for Mr Mamasela to convince Mr Sefola toaccompany him.  When you meet Mr Mamasela you will understandthis.  You will understand why I say this when you meet Mr Mamasela.</p>

Having consultedwith my seniors, the attitude would be the same, namely, and Iwant to place it on record.   As you will remember, on Mondaywhen the application was made to subpoena the witnesses, thesewere particularly 204 witnesses under the State Witness ProtectionProgramme.  These 204 witnesses are co-deeders of the applicants. As you will also remember, the position of the State from thebeginning would have been that there would have been an objectionand that there would have been the request not to subpoena thesetestimonies, since these would be key witnesses in the State'scase.  If amnesty is denied and it is possible to prosecute, thenthey would be the key witnesses.  It was the position of the Attorney-Generalthat should this Committee decide to subpoena these witnessesand if they were to give testimony, the Attorney-General wouldrest in that decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2118"><a name="pos2118"></a> The difference, however, is that Mr Currin's witnesses are simplymembers of the family, they are relatives of the victims.  Theseare not persons who were present on the scene of any of the deeds. These are simply persons who will say that we had children orhusbands who went missing at a certain stage until during thecourse of this year has the State obtained statements, it becamepossible to determine where these family members might be.  Thereason why Mr Currin is calling these witnesses is not to givealternative testimony since they were not present at the events,but to consider some of the reparations that might be made tothese persons if it is determined at a later</p>

<p class="line" id="line2121"><a name="pos2121"></a>stage that they were in fact victims.   In that case the Attorney-General'sposition would be that there is a fundamental difference betweenthe 204 witnesses whom the applicants intended to subpoena andthese witnesses who simply will bring testimony that they lostthese family members through some or other act. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2122"><a name="pos2122"></a> This, then, is the position of the Attorney-General in this particularcase.  I don't know if you wanted to ask me any additional questionsin this regard. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2123"><a name="pos2123"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> They are not strictly speaking witnesses,are they?  Are these people not persons who should have been given notice in terms of 19(4) of their right to be present and totestify and they are taking advantage of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2124"><a name="pos2124"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Indeed this is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2125"><a name="pos2125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I understand you to say that they are not witnesseswho fall in the category of section 204 witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2126"><a name="pos2126"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2127"><a name="pos2127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And that therefore strictly speaking you arenot raising an objection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2128"><a name="pos2128"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is also the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2129"><a name="pos2129"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Du Toit, is it also not true that thesewitnesses might be able to throw more light on whether the offencesin respect of which amnesty is being sought by the applicant isan act associated with a political objective in terms of section19(4)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2130"><a name="pos2130"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That might well be the case.  UnfortunatelyI would not be able to make a statement in this regard since Iam not part of this hearing.  I am simply here to take notes andto see what the givens are of this application.  Whether theymight be able to enlighten the committee with regard to any ofthese matters, that would depend on the</p>

<p class="line" id="line2132"><a name="pos2132"></a>415</p>
<p class="line" id="line2133"><a name="pos2133"></a>questions asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2134"><a name="pos2134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Du Toit, there is no reason why you can beprecluded or in any way precluded from these proceedings.  Shouldyou feel at any stage that you would like to enlighten this Committeeon information that you have relating to the evidence or witnessesor questions you might want to put to witnesses, then I see noreason why you should be precluded from doing so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2135"><a name="pos2135"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Thank you, Chair.  I will convey this to theAttorney-General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2136"><a name="pos2136"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Mr Du Toit, the previous application waswhether these persons should be subpoenaed.  Mr Mamasela is afurther person implicated, whom in terms of article 19(4) wouldalso have the right out of his own to bring testimony.  The question,however, is whether permission would force him through a subpoenato give testimony and in that regard we made a ruling.  Thereis, however, nothing that stands in the way of anyone in termsof article 19(4) to bring testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2137"><a name="pos2137"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is also the case, Mr De Jager, and thatis why we want to say that our attitude is that the grounds onwhich Mr Currin is bringing this testimony is particularly sincethey are the victims in this case and it would be proper to categorisethem as victims for further steps.  On these grounds we have noobjections at this moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2138"><a name="pos2138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Currin, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2139"><a name="pos2139"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Mr Chair, just directly to reply to Mr DeJager.  You will remember when Adv Pretorious addressed you hedid so in that he had contact with the 204 witnesses and thatat that time they had indicated that should the Commission subpoenathem they would be willing to bring</p>
<p class="line" id="line2140"><a name="pos2140"></a>4B testimony/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2141"><a name="pos2141"></a>416</p>
<p class="line" id="line2142"><a name="pos2142"></a>testimony, but they would not be willing to bring voluntary testimonyin view of their being State witnesses and that is why there isa fundamental difference between the current witnesses who arevictims and who are allowed by the Act to bring testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2143"><a name="pos2143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Similarly in this case here.  The ladies whoare here and who are related to the deceased may very well want,despite the fact that they are State witnesses in a trial whichmay take place, they would like to come here and give evidence. And I don't know whether there is any power that can preventthem from doing so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2144"><a name="pos2144"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I just want to say, the factthat I raised the point was not to preclude them from giving evidence. I raised the point to show, according to the applicants, thatthe Attorney-General's view on this is inconsistent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2145"><a name="pos2145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> (Inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2146"><a name="pos2146"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't want to get into adebate with that.  I must say, however, as I recall the argumentof the Attorney-General was that if the State witnesses wouldgive evidence his case would be prejudiced.  I don't actuallysee the reason for us going into a debate on that.  I just wantto place on record that I differ from the Attorney-General andthat we still fail to see the difference between any of the Statewitnesses.  If the argument was that the case of the State wouldbe prejudiced that would be the case in respect of all the witnesses. But we will abide by the decision of the Committee and the victimscan testify.</p>

If the Committee would ratherhear her make all these statements, that's fine I mean we don'thave a problem with that, we just thought we could maybe curtailproceedings a little bit by placing certain things on record.</p>

If the victim comes and testifies and contradictsthe applicants on material facts pertaining to the happeningswe feel we should have a right not to vigorously cross-examinebut just to test the evidence on that basis.   If my learned friendis going to place on record certain facts in respect of the factsof the matter, that means that I will not be able to test theevidence of the victims in that regard.   If he wants to contradictthe evidence of the applicants then we should be afforded, withrespect, the opportunity to ask them</p>

<p class="line" id="line2820"><a name="pos2820"></a>Makope was picked up, no mention was made of this document andI wasn't provided with this document before.   That is the firstpoint.   The second point is that on the left of this documentthe article, the last paragraph of the article reads as follows:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2821"><a name="pos2821"></a>  "Mark, his mother and uncle, Elizabeth Make and James Makeconfirmed that Make disappeared on July 17 after telling themthat he was going to Swaziland, Lesotho and Botswana on a churchmission."</p>
<p class="line" id="line2822"><a name="pos2822"></a>That evidence wasn't presented or advanced by Mr Make's motherand I would have liked to have asked Mr Make's mother questionsabout this specific allegation.   I want to place that on recordfirstly that this evidence wasn't given by Mrs Make and that we'rebeing prejudiced by not having this document available to askMrs Make questions about this.   I want a direction from the Committee,please about the use of documents if my learned friend Mr Mpsheintends using documents during cross-examination of witnesses,I would ask the Committee to direct that we be supplied with thosedocuments before the main examination starts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2823"><a name="pos2823"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> I think that latter request is a genuine oneand a fair one Mr Mpshe.

She never made that allegation,never said that to the reporter.   She says they asked her ifshe knew what had happened to her son and she said she didn'tknow and she denies that she said that.

We gave an undertaking yesterday that we will starttoday with Brigadier Cronje on the general background and affordMr Currin a chance to</p>
<p class="line" id="line2836"><a name="pos2836"></a>1b cross-examine /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2837"><a name="pos2837"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 456 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2838"><a name="pos2838"></a>cross-examine him on that before we go ahead any further and thatis how I understand the proceedings will go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2839"><a name="pos2839"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Then what happens to the rest of Mr Cronje'sevidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2840"><a name="pos2840"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman we will then go ahead withsome of the other incidents pertaining to Van Vuuren and Hechterbut we will get to Brigadier Cronje's evidence hopefully duringtoday, otherwise we will start with it tomorrow and we will hopefullyfinish with that during this week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2841"><a name="pos2841"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Mr Currin is that the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2842"><a name="pos2842"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> Mr Chairman this comes as a complete surpriseto me, I thought that Brigadier Cronje was standing over untilhe testifies and that he testifies once, I thought that was yourruling.   In fact my understanding was that you were proceedingwith other applications, however I wasn't present when the discussionstook place in chambers so maybe Mr Mpshe can give us some guidance.  I have no difficulty at all in beginning the cross-examinationof Brigadier Cronje, I would just have to go and get my file andrequire a five minute adjournment to prepare myself to commencethat cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2843"><a name="pos2843"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman we don't have a problem, actuallywhat I want to say is during this week we have acceded to everyrequest of everybody, Mr Mpshe, Mr Currin, we will fall in withevery request of them whenever they want to hear, whatever incidents,we're prepared to fall in with that so we are prepared to go onwith Geoffrey Sebia(?) under these circumstances Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2844"><a name="pos2844"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Mr Mpshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2845"><a name="pos2845"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman just to recall what was decidedupon in chambers, it was that we do not go on with the</p>

<p class="line" id="line2847"><a name="pos2847"></a>MR MPSHE 457 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2848"><a name="pos2848"></a>Hammanskraal matter but the ruling that was made was to the effectthat we continue with other matters that we can deal with todayand that was the conclusion in chambers Mr Chairman, that wasthe impression that was given right through.   Mr Chairman justsome few minutes before we could start then I was approached byMr Currin who said if we cross-examine Brigadier Cronje will youhave any problem, I said no I won't have any problem but I didnot see that as putting aside the decision to deal with othermatters that are standing.   I want to believe Mr Chairman itis in the interests of all here present, applicants as well asvictims, that we continue with incidences as we have been doingMr Chairman and the ruling that Brigadier Cronje would be cross-examinedon the general background the ruling was given by this Committeethat that would be done when Brigadier Cronje gives his evidenceon the other incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2849"><a name="pos2849"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> We will proceed in terms of the arrangementsthat were arrived at in chambers this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2850"><a name="pos2850"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I call CaptainHechter.   Mr Chairman it is the matter of Geoffrey Sebia, thatis page 111.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2851"><a name="pos2851"></a>1b </p>
<p class="line" id="line2852"><a name="pos2852"></a>458</p>
<p class="line" id="line2853"><a name="pos2853"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> ...represents the family in regard to thisparticular matter, we haven't yet been given a copy of the applicationand furthermore, as far as we know, the Sebia, the family is nothere.   I believe that they are not present today.   So maybeMr Mpshe should just ensure that they are in fact here beforeone proceeds with that application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2854"><a name="pos2854"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> They knew this matter was proceeding todaydid they not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2855"><a name="pos2855"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> Mr Chairman I'm not sure whether they knewthat it would proceed today.   The difficulty is with all theapplicants, and there are about 40 family members who have beentold to be on hold and that they would be contacted as and whentheir matter is due to be heard, many of them are employed theycan't sit here for two weeks and wait for their matter to be heardand the arrangement is that they will be advised in advance andwe have been advising our clients in advance as to when they shouldbe here, depending upon the arrangement that was made the previous.  As far as today is concerned, the arrangement was unequivocalthat the Motasa matter would be heard today so the arrangementswe made with our clients were with the Motasa's and in fact themother and child are both here at the moment and their matteris now not going to be called.   I believe Sepia was not advisedthat his matter would be heard today.   Maybe Mr Mpshe can informyou further on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2856"><a name="pos2856"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Currin the position, the reality now isthat it has become difficult to proceed with Motasa's case...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2857"><a name="pos2857"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> I accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2858"><a name="pos2858"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> And the further reality is that the only othermatter we can proceed with is Sebia's case.   I respect your</p>

<p class="line" id="line2860"><a name="pos2860"></a>MR MPSHE 459 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2861"><a name="pos2861"></a>statement that the family may not be here, but you are also notunmindful of the fact that you are their legal representative.  Are you of the view that we cannot proceed even if they arenot there and although you are here, have you not consulted themfully?   I know they have got the right to be here but we knowthat last week you asked for an adjournment of about three daysor so, so that you could consult with all your clients.   Presumablythis included the Sebia people as well, I don't know, but givenall these difficulties that we have and this reality before us,are you saying that we cannot see our way through to proceedingwith the Sebia matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2862"><a name="pos2862"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> The Sebia instruction we got yesterday, it'sthe only matter that we're not ready to proceed on, we're readyto proceed on all the other matters where we are involved.   Iwas told that the Zozo Hut matter would be called next becausethere the relevant family members are not in the country and theyknow the matter is here and they know it is proceeding, and theyhave no objection to the matter proceeding in their absence andI was told that that matter would proceed now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2863"><a name="pos2863"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> A great deal of time is taken up unfortunatelyin problems of this kind.   I think greater effort should be madeto co-ordinate your activities, it is not always possible to carryout decisions that are taken two days ago, but I think at theend of each day if a decision is taken as to how the proceedingsare going to take place the next day, everybody ought to try andabide by those decisions.   I do not like adjourning these hearingsat short notice every now and then, just to enable hiccups ofthis kind to be sorted out, but it does seem that if take thisshort adjournment</p>

<p class="line" id="line2866"><a name="pos2866"></a>now we might save some time in the long run and I hope that withinthat short time you will finally decide who we are proceedingwith and make a beginning immediately we commence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2867"><a name="pos2867"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman perhaps an adjournment wouldnot be necessary, we are ready to go ahead with Brigadier Cronjeon the Ribiero matter.   I can call Brigadier Cronje on the Ribieromatter.   I can call Captain Hechter on the Ribiero matter, wecan go ahead with that matter it's really not necessary to adjournMr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2868"><a name="pos2868"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> Very well we are ready to go on with whateverincident suits all the other parties.</p>

If they areconcerned about what is happening in this tribunal they will makearrangements to be here so that when their matter is heard theyare ready and available?</p>

We make arrangements before the day commencesand we ensure that the people that are required on that day arepresent.   The arrangements were changed this morning, a matterwas proceeding and we were ready with our clients.   The factthat those arrangements were changed were really out of our hands.  We can get clients here at short notice as long as we are givensome sort of detail.   Many of the people are travelling fromlong distances, many of them are unemployed, at our expense weare transporting them here and back, we are co-ordinating thoseefforts and we will co-operate absolutely</p>

<p class="line" id="line2880"><a name="pos2880"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier could you page to page 131 of yourapplication?   Brigadier would you present to the Committee yourinvolvement in the matter of Dr Fabian Ribiero and his wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2881"><a name="pos2881"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chair, I was contacted by Commandant Charl Naudeof Special Forces, who requested me to provide him with a memorandumwith regard to Dr Ribiero and his activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2882"><a name="pos2882"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Was this Charl Naude notified about thishearing that...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2883"><a name="pos2883"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman a number of notifications wentout yesterday on all who were involved in all matters.   Thesewere issued yesterday and an attempt was made to serve them yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2884"><a name="pos2884"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Were they served?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2885"><a name="pos2885"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman I cannot say whether they wereserved or not, but what I can vouch on is that they were doneand they were signed yesterday, the notifications, and they wentout with investigators to go and serve.   I have not receivedreturns of service this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2886"><a name="pos2886"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Perhaps during the adjournment you will sortthat out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2887"><a name="pos2887"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2888"><a name="pos2888"></a>EXAMINATION BY MR DU PLESSIS (contd)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2889"><a name="pos2889"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I asked Charl Naude for what purposes he neededthe memorandum and he answered that Special Forces had targetedRibiero or had identified him as a possible target.  I told himthat if they had identified him as a target, they surely had tohave information of their own and why did they need a memorandumfrom me?   He replied that they only</p>
<p class="line" id="line2890"><a name="pos2890"></a>2. wanted /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2891"><a name="pos2891"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 463 J H CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2892"><a name="pos2892"></a>wanted to verify the information to ascertain whether we had thesame information as what they had so that he could hand in thereport or present a report to General Joubert, his CommandingOfficer.   The moment he mentioned the word "target"I realised that this was a terrorist(?) operation.  I indicatedthat I would make available the applicable file but that theywould have to draft the memorandum themselves.  I must mentionthat there was no mention of Mrs Ribiero.   I then instructedCaptain Hechter to keep an eye on a member of Charl Naude's staffwho drafted the memorandum personally.    Hechter informed meat a later stage that the Special Services requested him particularyCharl Naude, or Charl Naude personally and one of his staff persons,A Robin, to assist them in their planning with regard to the eliminationof Dr Ribiero.   Hechter kept me up to date with regard to theirplans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2893"><a name="pos2893"></a> I was therefore aware of the operation since it was a, or sinceI suspected that it was a terrorist operation I did not interferewith the preparations any further.   Subsequent to the event,after the act had been committed, I heard from Captain Hechterthat two black Angolan men who had been flown in by Special Forcesfrom somewhere in the then South West Africa, that these two Angolanmen had shot Dr Ribiero and his wife.   Subsequently I also hadbeen informed or I heard that Brigadier Basie Smit of the detectivebranch and that he had determined that Noel Robie's(?) vehicle,which I must mention was registered in Noel Robie's name althoughit was a SADF vehicle, that Noel Robie had picked up the blackAngolan men from somewhere after they had shot the Ribiero's andthat he removed them from the scene of the crime.   Basie SmitI believe had</p>
<p class="line" id="line2894"><a name="pos2894"></a>2. determined /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2895"><a name="pos2895"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 464 J H CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2896"><a name="pos2896"></a>determined from Leyland, who manufactures the Landrover, thatthis particular vehicle was in fact sold to the SADF.  After Ihad heard this, General Joubert of Special Forces phoned me andrequested me that Captain Hechter and myself would attend a meetingat their headquarters.   At this meeting the following personswere present, General Joubert, Colonel Joe Verster, CommandantCharl Naude, Lt Col Charl Naude, and an additional person whomI am unable to identify.   General Joubert informed me that BasieSmit had determined that the Landrover did belong to the SADFand that Noel Robie was in fact in command of the vehicle andhad driven the vehicle.   He requested me to, not to assist BasisSmit's investigation and in fact to ruin it one way or anotherand I told him that I would do whatever I could in this regard.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2897"><a name="pos2897"></a> The following evening I received a message at home from BrigadierSchoon that the Commissioner General, Johan Coetzee, would bevisiting me the next morning or that he wanted to see me the nextmorning.   Early the next morning before I was able to go to headoffice, Captain Hechter phoned me and informed me that GeneralJoubert had visited General Coetzee the previous evening and thatthe matter was discussed at that meeting.   Subsequently I wentto Brigadier Schoon who took me along to General Coetzee's office.  General Coetzee asked me whether I knew anything about the Ribieromatter, I told him that I did and I also told him that this wasan operation of Special Forces.    He then informed me that GeneralJoubert and General Gleeson the previous evening had visited himat home with regard to the Ribiero, or to the Ribiero's death.  He then asked me why I was co-operating with the SADF and Itold him that</p>

<p class="line" id="line2899"><a name="pos2899"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 465 J H CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2900"><a name="pos2900"></a>Brigadier Schoon had given me instructions to co-operate withSpecial Forces and that Schoon had in fact claimed that GeneralCoetzee had given him this instruction and Brigadier Schoon didnot deny that he had done so.   General Coetzee then took theinvestigation away from Basie Smit and gave it to Brigadier VanWyk, he tasked Brigadier Van Wyk with the investigation.   Asfar as I can remember there was a later provisional investigationin which Noel Robie did appear.   Noel Robie was then, it wasthen said that he was not guilty in any way, or blameworthy inany way.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line2901"><a name="pos2901"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Are you personally aware from whom, where andhow a decision was made to eliminate the Ribiero's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2902"><a name="pos2902"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I am not aware of this but I can say that CharlNaude informed me that he had to do the preparations for GeneralJoubert.   I would be of the mind that the Ribiero's were on theterrorist(?) priority list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2903"><a name="pos2903"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> General you would not know exactly who madethe decision and who exactly gave the instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2904"><a name="pos2904"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2905"><a name="pos2905"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier, on page 132 in the second paragraphyou say that General Joubert had asked you whether you could notin one way or another destabilise the investigation of BrigadierBasie Smit.   Did you do this or were your efforts in this regardto remove the investigation from Basie Smit to Brigadier Van Wyk,or do you not know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2906"><a name="pos2906"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I could not do anything to counter the investigationof Brigadier Basie Smit, it was simply impossible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2907"><a name="pos2907"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier do you know in what activities theRiviero's were involved exactly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2908"><a name="pos2908"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Dr Ribiero was a very active activist for theANC,</p>
<p class="line" id="line2909"><a name="pos2909"></a>2. he /...</p>

<p class="line" id="line2912"><a name="pos2912"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would you know where Dr and Mrs Ribiero died?Do you have any knowledge of the death of the Ribiero's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2913"><a name="pos2913"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I do have knowledge of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2914"><a name="pos2914"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> With regard to the political intentions ofthe deed, could we go to page 135 at the top and there we havethe general justification with regard to which you've alreadybrought testimony with regard to eliminations in general.   Thenon page 140 could you present to the Committee as of the secondparagraph</p>
<p class="line" id="line2915"><a name="pos2915"></a>  "The context within which this occurred was against thebackground of daily unrest, violence and intimidation.   It wasthe purpose of the ANC to make the country ungovernable as partof the political resistance against the State."</p>

<p class="line" id="line2917"><a name="pos2917"></a>  "I was only in a very limited way involved in this matterand had no particular purpose with my activities.   It was inthe context and against the background of the struggle of theState against the ANC and liberation movements."</p>

<p class="line" id="line2919"><a name="pos2919"></a>  "I gave, I had no direct instructions with regard to thisoperation.

<p class="line" id="line2922"><a name="pos2922"></a>Brigadier, the last question, will Captain Hechter be able togive us greater detail with regard to this operation than yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2923"><a name="pos2923"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He knew everything with regard to the planningof this matter.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2926"><a name="pos2926"></a>COMMISSION ADJOURNS - ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2927"><a name="pos2927"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Mr Cronje you will hold on for a whilethere's a point which we would like to raise and try to sort outnow if possible.   Gentlemen and ladies, you will recall thatbefore we adjourned for tea, a point was raised with regard tothe notification of some people and we indicated that we willhave a look at that point during tea time.   It seems to us, subjectto what the legal representatives taking part in the proceedingswill say, it seems to us that on the face of it no proper noticehas been given to the people who should have been notified onthe fact that they might be implicated in this matter.   The witnesshas mentioned a few names which also appeared in the applicationand just to give an example Mr Naude, General Coetzee and GeneralGleeson and so on and so forth.   As I have said it would appearon the face of it that proper notice in terms of the Act has notbeen given to these people.   Mr Mpshe would you like to starton that one before we hear from your colleagues?   This is solelyin connection with the Ribiero issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2928"><a name="pos2928"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Mr Chairman it isso, the only person whom I had identified for notification purposeswas Noel Robie of the Spes-magte that is the only person againstwhom I have issued a notice which was</p>

<p class="line" id="line2931"><a name="pos2931"></a>intended to be served yesterday.   As I have indicated I havenot yet received any return of service as to whether he has receivedit but the notice has gone out.   The other members mentionedon page 132 of the application, these I did not issue any notification.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2932"><a name="pos2932"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Why did you not do that Mr Mpshe where fromthe fact of the application they are implicated persons and interms of Section 19(4) they ought to have been issued also withsuch notifications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2933"><a name="pos2933"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> It may have been an oversight on my part butthe reason why I chose Noel Robie alone it is because in the applicationit is him who has been mentioned as being the person who was organisingthis and the person who was involved in the execution of thisoperation.   As regards the people mentioned on page 132, theonly involvement that came to my mind as far as they are concernedis when the came, at a later stage after the operation was carriedout, when they were conducting a meeting with the members, includingthe applicants.   So I deemed it then, it may have been an oversight,that the important person here is Noel Robie of the Spes-magtebecause this operation was done by the Spes-magte and not by thesecurity task, that is the reason I chose Noel Robie alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2934"><a name="pos2934"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Whatever the reason, the reality is thatsome of these people have not been notified.   It takes us tothe next issue, is this a case where we can proceed hearing thetype of evidence, in fact can we proceed with this applicationdespite the fact that these various generals and other peoplehave not been notified?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2938"><a name="pos2938"></a>has to continue what I can say is that because of the disclosurethat has been made to me by the Committee now, I can cause thenotices to be issued today to the various people mentioned herein.  If the Committee feels that they are only going to be informedtoday it will not be apposite to hear the matter today, I willstand by the Committee's decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2939"><a name="pos2939"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBE::</span> The issue of the length of the notice priorto the hearing or continuance of the hearing maybe we'll leavethat until later.   Mr Du Plessis are we in a position to proceedwith this application given the fact that the people like I'vealready mentioned, General Coetzee, Joe Verster, General Gleeson,Charl Naude, these people it is now a fact they have not beennotified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2940"><a name="pos2940"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes.   Mr Chairman I want to place ourposition on record in this regard.   First, in answer to my learnedfriend Mr Mpshe's argument that he only gave notice to let peopleknow who are implicated in the actual commission of the deed orthis specific deed itself, that that argument does not pertainto the Metasi matter because in the Metasi matter it was decidedthis morning that that matter cannot go on because other peopleare implicated should have notice and should be witnesses.   Itseems to me there is not consistency in the application of whoshould be called as witnesses, who should be notified as partieswho have an interest in the matter.   We, and I want to placethis on record, before the hearings were scheduled to start on21 October, before that we gave an indication that we are workinghard to finalise the applications, we were requested to hand inthe applications as soon as possible so as to enable the Commissionto notify all relevant persons.   We</p>
<p class="line" id="line2941"><a name="pos2941"></a>2. did /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2942"><a name="pos2942"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 470 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2943"><a name="pos2943"></a>did so.   We handed in the applications the Monday before the21st, that was a week before.   We were given an indication bythe Commission, as I understood it and my attorney as well, thatthere was enough time that they would be able to reach personsand those persons they won't reach could be reached during thefirst week of the hearings and one could then proceed with thosematters that people were notified.   We are now two and a halfweeks away from the point where we handed in the applications.  As far as I understand, the Commission has an investigativeunit whose task it is to notify people implicated in the hearingsand who have an interest in applications.   We, as well as thepublic and I want to include yourselves as well, expect from thepeople who are responsible for this to do that.   I am not pointinga finger to my learned friend because that's not his job, he'sthe chief presenter of evidence.   What we say is if applicationshave to be postponed every time because these requirements havenot been met in respect of which we have no obligation, in respectof which we cannot do anything about, we are prejudiced.   Weare prepared, there are various issues involved here, there arequestions of legal costs involved here which everybody knows isa difficult aspect and I just want to place on record that ifmatters have to be postponed because people have not been notified,as they should have done, the applicants are prejudiced by that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2944"><a name="pos2944"></a> What I want to say, however, is that we are fully prepared andI reiterate what I said this morning.  We are fully prepared toaccommodate everybody concerned in these hearings.   We are preparedto go ahead with any application that we possibly can where peoplehave been notified and we</p>
<p class="line" id="line2945"><a name="pos2945"></a>2. feel /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2946"><a name="pos2946"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 471 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2947"><a name="pos2947"></a>feel that because the Act makes provision that people must benotified, that must be done before an application is heard.  I am not conceding in saying that, that that is a requirementthat has to be satisfied before amnesty can be granted, I willhave another argument on that when I address the Committee onthe requirements for amnesty.   As I read the Act, compliancewith this specific part of the Act is not an obligation that restson the applicants and because it doesn't rest on the applicantsthat is not a requirement the applicants have to satisfy for amnesty.  What we don't want is we don't want procedural difficultieswhich can cause difficulties later.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line2948"><a name="pos2948"></a> Our view is we will be prejudiced but we also say if people haven'tbeen notified there could be problems with the hearing continuingon that specific incident and we are quite prepared to go on withany other incident we can under the circumstances to utilise thetime.   I want to make the point that Brigadier Cronje is therenow, there was an indication by Mr Currin that he wanted to cross-examineBrigadier Cronje...(end of side 1)...</p>

<p class="line" id="line2950"><a name="pos2950"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> I was just inviting you in fact Mr Du Plessisto tell us on the merits whether you argue that we could validlyproceed with the application given the fact that the notices havenot been given.

<p class="line" id="line2958"><a name="pos2958"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes.   Mr Chairman I just want to makethe point however absolutely clear that the concession that wemake that the hearings cannot go on on this basis that peopleare not notified is based upon the fact that we perceive thatthere might be problems later with somebody who might feel thathe might be prejudiced because he wasn't given notice.   WhatI don't and what I'm not doing is I'm not conceding that thisis something that the applicants have to comply with as a requirementfor amnesty.   I just want to make that clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2959"><a name="pos2959"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Nobody has said that Mr Du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2960"><a name="pos2960"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2961"><a name="pos2961"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> Mr Chairman, members of the Committee I'llbe very brief.   I think it would be risky to proceed withoutthat compliance, that is our position.   Obviously on behalf ofvictims, application going on and then not going on, hot and coldis really very, very difficult for the victims but our feelingis that it would be risky to proceed without giving proper notice.  Just to make the final point, we are ready to cross-examineon the general representation that was made regarding politicalmotive and political objective, which doesn't really involve thenames of the people that were mentioned during the evidence inchief.   I will leave it in the hands of the Committee to decidewhether or not one should even take that chance.   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2962"><a name="pos2962"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBE::</span> Mr Mpshe I'm not so sure whether you needto reply you seem to be feeling strongly about saying</p>

<p class="line" id="line2964"><a name="pos2964"></a>MR MPSHE 473 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2965"><a name="pos2965"></a>something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2966"><a name="pos2966"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman, if the Chair allows me it mightnot be apposite to do it now because some response has been doneto what my learned friend Mr Du Plessis has said.   I wanted torespond to what is said that even if he pretends not to be layingthe blame at my doorstep, he has actually done that by sayingthat the people were not timeously informed.   Mr Chairman, membersof the Committee it was not only a matter or receiving the applicationin the original hearing, this is a voluminous application, itinvolved my reading everything which they have submitted - withinfour days - and deciding who is to be notified within four daysand issuing out instructions to the investigating officer withinfour days and do all sorts of other things.   I don't want thisto be taken as if I am inefficient, but I want this to be takenthat if I am inefficient this was, they also contributed to itbecause this volume was given to me four days before the hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2967"><a name="pos2967"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Mr Mpshe we don't blame you but we thinkthe blame should rest, this application should never have beenput down for hearing during this, with a week's notice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2968"><a name="pos2968"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> I cannot respond to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2969"><a name="pos2969"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> I may mention that my brother George Ngcobehas been talking on behalf of the Committee and expressing theCommittee's views.   In the last few minutes of the evidence ofBrigadier Cronje, certain names were mentioned, and this is nowevidence, what appears on the papers is not evidence.  In theevidence it appears that those who were ultimately responsiblefor the identifying of the targets and determining that actionshould be taken against the Ribiero family, people whose namesare mentioned in that regard, and</p>

<p class="line" id="line2971"><a name="pos2971"></a>474</p>
<p class="line" id="line2972"><a name="pos2972"></a>bearing in mind that this particular incident - that is the deathof Dr Ribiero and his wife has become news throughout the countryand has been news for a long time.   We feel it is a matter ofsuch great importance that people whose names are mentioned ashaving identified the targets, who initiated steps to be takenand then of course the persons who implemented the action, whohas been given notice, we feel that the matter is of such magnitudethat we might be doing gross injustice to a number of people whoare very heavily implicated if the evidence of this witness isto be accepted, and the consequences may be serious for all, thisCommittee does not want to face urgent applications or interdictstomorrow morning as a result of individuals hearing on the radiothis evening or on TV that their names were mentioned, they weren'tgiven notice and they want to stop these proceedings.   One wantsto try and avoid that kind of thing happening now in this applicationand in any other application which we are going to consider.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2973"><a name="pos2973"></a> How to salvage the situation involves two things.   We may beable to do things immediately or we may be able to allow Mr Currinto proceed with the questioning of Brigadier Cronje, which wouldbe a good thing that we should dispose of if we can.   Mr Mpshe,whatever other matter you propose dealing with after that, isa matter in which you will have to satisfy before you and Mr DuPlessis begin, that people's names that may be mentioned are peoplewho have been given notice, otherwise you're going to find thatevery hour we're going to ask for an adjournment and an explanationas to whether notices have been given or not.   I think sufficienthas been said in that regard and it is the view that we shouldnow proceed.   I am sorry to interrupt your evidence</p>

<p class="line" id="line2976"><a name="pos2976"></a>at this stage, it does seem that it can't be avoided.

Is that an accurate summary of your political motive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2983"><a name="pos2983"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The motive was, as Mr Currin is saying, to maintainthe National Party, to support the apartheid</p>

<p class="line" id="line3016"><a name="pos3016"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> During your evidence you told us about threeseparate events or incidents which seemed to have been the turningpoint where the security police actually began to take pro-activesteps by engaging in a war situation and then officially, in thecontext of the security police, breaching the laws of the land.  I just want to go through those three with you and find outwhat their order was, which one came first, second or third becauseI'm not clear.  The first one you mentioned in your evidence isBrigadier Victor in 1986 where he said that you should take whateversteps are necessary.   You also mentioned that in 1986 BrigadierSchoon said that you should work closely with Spes-magte and youinterpreted that as meaning that you should engage in the war.  Then thirdly you mentioned</p>
<p class="line" id="line3017"><a name="pos3017"></a>"trevits", and trevits was something which, as far asI can establish, was actually initiated in 1985.   Did trevitscome before the first two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3018"><a name="pos3018"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chair, trevits was founded in 1986 and the othertwo instructions I only received from Brigadier Victor and afterthat from Brigadier Schoon.   Additionally there was another incidentwhen General Van der Merwe gave me the instruction to be involvedin the "zero hand grenade event" and when he told methat this instruction came from General Coetzee, previous MinisterLe Grange and P W Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3019"><a name="pos3019"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What was the date, the year of that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3020"><a name="pos3020"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> This incident took place in roughly June 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3021"><a name="pos3021"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would you please tell us in more detail preciselywhat constituted trevits and how it worked and I'll just go throughmy summary and I'd like you to add to that.

<p class="line" id="line3024"><a name="pos3024"></a>objective was to gather information regarding targets around theentire country.    In different regions, as I understand you,meetings took place once a month where information was collatedfrom all sectors and that included military intelligence, nationalintelligence, the security branch and spes-magte, special forces.  The information which was gathered was compared at these meetingsand a list, which  was a priority list, was prepared on whichtargets were identified.   Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3025"><a name="pos3025"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Apart from the fact that when trevits was foundedin 1985 it was primarily to identify foreign targets, targetsoutside the country, but I believe after the state of emergencythese instructions also included internal targets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3026"><a name="pos3026"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...establishment, was there not a decisionthat trevits would also operate internally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3027"><a name="pos3027"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did not have permanent sitting on trevits butsince the Ribiero's instruction I believe also was agreed to bytrevits during 1986 and it took place during 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3028"><a name="pos3028"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You say you didn't have a permanent seat ontrevits, my apologies I see there is a question from Adv De Jager.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3030"><a name="pos3030"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The co-ordinator of information was Colonel TomLouw.   The head of trevits at a certain stage was General, thenBrigadier Buchner  and later I believe General Beukes.</p>

Inthe Eastern Transvaal it could have been Captain Dietlis(?). In the far North I don't know, I can't think who it might havebeen.   I don't know about the Northern Cape.

<p class="line" id="line3145"><a name="pos3145"></a>instruction to work with Military Intelligence I would have interpretedit differently, but Spes Forces were a specialised combat unitand the only deduction I could make from the instruction was thatwe were supposed to co-operate with Special Forces in the war.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3184"><a name="pos3184"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> I hear what you are saying, the difficultyis the arbitrary choosing of who is the enemy.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3189"><a name="pos3189"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier, before we go back to the war situationthat we were talking about I would just like to take you backto trevits and ask you one or two more questions regarding thatstructure which still requires some clarification in my mind.  In your evidence you said that the commanding officer of trevitsinitially was Mr Louw and then there was Hoof-generaal Buchnerand subsequently there were other people.   Besides them in thatcentral structure to which all the regional structures were accountable,who else served on that central structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3190"><a name="pos3190"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chair, Colonel Louw was not in charge of trevits,he co-ordinated the information.   The head of trevits would havebeen the Brigadiers and Generals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3191"><a name="pos3191"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Beukes and later Victor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3192"><a name="pos3192"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3197"><a name="pos3197"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Were there any other people on that centralstructure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3198"><a name="pos3198"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not as far as I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3199"><a name="pos3199"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> So it was a very small structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3200"><a name="pos3200"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> This is because it was a secret organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3201"><a name="pos3201"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Who did they represent when for example ColonelLouw was there and Hoof-generaal Buchner, who were they representingwhen they were on that structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3202"><a name="pos3202"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Certainly the Commissioner of Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3203"><a name="pos3203"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The Commissioner, is that a guess or are youstating that as a fact?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3208"><a name="pos3208"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I want to rephrase a question that I put toyou earlier which was a little bit ambiguous and which resultedin certain comments from the Committee.   I think it's commoncause that the liberation movements were waging an armed struggleagainst the security forces.   If I understand your evidence correctly,the security forces in turn were waging an undeclared counter-waragainst the members of the liberation movement, political activistsand trouble-makers, to quote your evidence in chief.  Is thatcorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3209"><a name="pos3209"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3210"><a name="pos3210"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I want to put it to you that the family membersof victims, as well as victims who survived, were not aware ofthe fact that you were waging a war against them because it wasa (inaudible) exercise, wasn't it?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3213"><a name="pos3213"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3214"><a name="pos3214"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> But there were activists, political activistsand so-called "trouble-makers", I put it to you thatthey were not aware of the fact that there was an undeclared waragainst them where those who waged that war saw themselves notaccountable to any laws of the land.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3215"><a name="pos3215"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chair if they did not know this then they wouldhave been extremely uninformed, certainly our actions in the blacktownships was of such a nature that they must have realised thatthe police were waging war against the activists or at least withthe ANC and the other liberation movements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3216"><a name="pos3216"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> They were under the impression that the governmentof the day had passed draconian laws, the Internal Security Act,Emergency Regulations, and that it was through those instrumentsof law which the security forces were attempting to challengeoff the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3217"><a name="pos3217"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I can only say that under all circumstances we,along with the military or acted along with the military, andhow this decision was made I would not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3218"><a name="pos3218"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...that political activists in the townshipsknew that they could at any stage be unlawfully killed pro-activelyby the security forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3219"><a name="pos3219"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did not say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3220"><a name="pos3220"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The implication of your answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3221"><a name="pos3221"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, the implication of my answer is that we hadwaged war along with the military and that I do not see how anyonecould have come to the conclusion that we were not doing so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3222"><a name="pos3222"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I'm not really understanding the answer itseems rather ambiguous to me.   Just let's think of a practical</p>
<p class="line" id="line3223"><a name="pos3223"></a>3. example /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3224"><a name="pos3224"></a>MR CURRIN 493 J H CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3225"><a name="pos3225"></a>example, there's an activist out there, he's a political activist,he's involved in the activities that you have referred to, whetherit's school boycotts, sabotage, whether it's bombings whatever,that is what he is involved in as an activist.   Are you sayingthat he knew that his activities would be pre-empted and thathe would be killed and that he did not expect rather that he wouldbe detained in terms of the Emergency Regulations or that he wouldbe charged with sabotage and sent to jail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3226"><a name="pos3226"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman with respect, I don't wantto object unnecessarily but my learned friend Mr Currin is askinga question of the witness of what he supposes people in the blacktownships thought or were thinking at that time.   We perceiveit as a bit of an unfair question he wasn't part of the blackcommunity at that time and perhaps Mr Currin should have led theevidence when he called people who lived in the black townshipsat that time, as witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3227"><a name="pos3227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes Mr Currin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3228"><a name="pos3228"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> What is the view of the Chairperson, is thisquestion a valid question or is it not a valid question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3229"><a name="pos3229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> You've asked this question in separate forms,in different ways - the same question - and the answer you'vegot is more or less the same.   I am of the view that I don'tthink you can take it any further.   Whether political activistsexpected that the price they will have to pay would be to be takenbefore the courts of law, tried and imprisoned, or whether theysuspected that they may one day be eliminated and so on, that'san issue which I do not think we can take very much further atthis stage.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3233"><a name="pos3233"></a>MR CURRIN 494 J H CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3234"><a name="pos3234"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> If I understand your evidence correctly, I'vemoved away from trevits with the previous question I asked, Iwent back to the war situation.   If I understand your evidencein your founding document correctly, your understanding of warfrom a security police perspective is that you got a licence tokill pro-actively, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3235"><a name="pos3235"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> After the instructions of Brigadier Victor andBrigadier Schoon I came to the conclusion that we had to engagein a military manner against the onslaught.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3236"><a name="pos3236"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Pro-actively.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3237"><a name="pos3237"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3238"><a name="pos3238"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Why did you make no provisions for prisoners?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3239"><a name="pos3239"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Detaining an activist would only have been atemporary solution, after a time the person would have been releasedthen he would have continued in his activities.  We thereforealso acted pre-emptively or preventitively to see to it that furtheracts of terror would not be engaged in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3240"><a name="pos3240"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Detentions were extended month after monthafter month and people were detained indefinitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3241"><a name="pos3241"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At some stage people would have to be released,it would have been demoralising in addition for the ANC when thesepersons were eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3242"><a name="pos3242"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you ever consider with the knowledge thatyou had of making a recommendation to the government of the daythat they declare Marshall Law and that they make provision forprisoners of war and comply with the Geneva Convention and otherrelevant conventions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3243"><a name="pos3243"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I never considered this.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3247"><a name="pos3247"></a>situation, just get a bit more clarity with regard to what constitutedan activist.   You've told us that activists were people who committedmurder, bombings, assault, robbery, arson, damage to property,intimidation, school boycotts, consumer boycotts and throwingstones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3248"><a name="pos3248"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3250"><a name="pos3250"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Certainly not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3251"><a name="pos3251"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> When did an activist become fair game for assassination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3252"><a name="pos3252"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It would only have been if it was an activistwith  a very high profile who engaged in several crimes and severalevents of intimidation, several instances of recruiting MK members,providing homes for terrorists or housing for terrorists, sucha person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3253"><a name="pos3253"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...the number of those actions?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3258"><a name="pos3258"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3263"><a name="pos3263"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was done with the purpose partly for propagandapurposes, but also so that the broad white public would believethat these people were poorly trained, that they were blowingthemselves up and so that the white public would be under theimpression that the security forces were winning the war withease and that the ANC was incapable.  The true state of affairswas never revealed to them, they had to be under the impressionthat we were winning because in the next election they would haveto vote for the government of the day again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3264"><a name="pos3264"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The intention was to fan the flames of warand of violence and to promote the whole feeling of a war psychosis,is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3265"><a name="pos3265"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The disinformation which was given to the whitepublic yes, that was the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3266"><a name="pos3266"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3267"><a name="pos3267"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3268"><a name="pos3268"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Didn't that then become a vicious circle foryou in the sense that as the country became more ungovernableand the war psychosis developed even more it in fact promotedthe need amongst yourselves for your own activities in contributingtowards the war psychosis, in creating the impression that manyof the deeds that you committed were in fact committed ratherby the activists, weren't you creating for yourselves a fertilebreeding ground for your own killings to justify your own killingsand your own actions?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3273"><a name="pos3273"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> Yes, the point is though Mr Chairman thatwhen they did that they didn't say that was committed by the securityforces, they created the impression that those killings were infact committed by the liberation movements.  They in fact addedfuel to the war psychosis, to the total onslaught from the liberationmovements.   They participated in creating the perception thatthe liberation movements were far more powerful than what theywere, which in turn justified their counter-war, that is the point.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3287"><a name="pos3287"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF COMMITTEE(?)::</span> If I could make it clearer foryou Brigadier Cronje, the intention of the question is this, sayfor instance someone was killed because of a bomb that explodedin a black township, the next morning it is said that this bombwas planted by the ANC, then the family members of the peoplewho died in this bombing would become angry at the ANC.   Thiswould cause conflict between these two groupings, one group wouldblame the other group that it was the cause of death.

<p class="line" id="line3453"><a name="pos3453"></a>were acting outside the law, you of course didn't put anythingin writing but did you have some sort of code of honour or somethingwhich would have implied that you would not go beyond a certainpoint, that certain things were allowed outside the law but noteverything was allowed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3454"><a name="pos3454"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I believe that everyone who worked with me knewexactly what they were allowed to do and what they were not allowedto do.   We would have discussed it and we would have given ourselvessome kind of measure in terms of which we would have worked, someguidelines or framework.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3455"><a name="pos3455"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> That is the question, what kind of frameworkdid you have?   ...that were participating, you just assumed thatwithin each person there was that self-regulation, is that whatyou are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3456"><a name="pos3456"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> After we had discussed it, yes.   Let me giveyou an example - children were not targets, innocent people werenot targets, activists who were involved only in school boycottswere not targets.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3458"><a name="pos3458"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...identified a high profile person that inyour view should not be detained but rather eliminated how didyou know that a detention and an interrogation would not havethe desired effect if you didn't at least try that route first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3459"><a name="pos3459"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We worked in terms of the reports of our informants,we realised that the person had to be interrogated, the personwas interrogated in such a way that we had to get the informationfrom the person.   If then this person was hurt and then detained,we knew that a magistrate would have had access and that we wouldhave been in trouble.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3460"><a name="pos3460"></a>4. QUESTION: /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3461"><a name="pos3461"></a>MR CURRAN 511 J H CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3462"><a name="pos3462"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Many of our clients were never detained, theywere just assassinated.   In your evidence you've said the purposeof interrogation, the purpose of detention and interrogation isbasically threefold;</p>
<p class="line" id="line3463"><a name="pos3463"></a>  (1) to intimidate the person, to stop that person from beingan activist</p>
<p class="line" id="line3464"><a name="pos3464"></a>  (2) to try and intimidate that person to become an informant,and</p>
<p class="line" id="line3465"><a name="pos3465"></a>  (3) to glean information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3466"><a name="pos3466"></a>That's the purpose of a detention and interrogation.   I wantto ask you why you did not first detain people on whose behalfwe are acting before you went out and eliminated them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3467"><a name="pos3467"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> In the first place once we interrogated the personand once we gained the information, this person's, the peoplewho gave this person instructions would have known what informationthis person had access to, they would therefore have changed theirplans.   Terrorists of whom they knew would have escaped and goneinto hiding in different places.   We also had to protect ourinformants because the person would have been able to point outour informants and we had to protect our informants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3468"><a name="pos3468"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Could I interrupt again?   The questionbefore this, as I understand your evidence and I would like youto tell me, you said you worked on information from informantsand after that you had to interrogate people and that if thatperson was hurt and then detained he would have access to a magistrateand "we would be in trouble", did you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3469"><a name="pos3469"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3470"><a name="pos3470"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> By that you mean that you would kill someone</p>

<p class="line" id="line3473"><a name="pos3473"></a>because he happened to have been hurt during interrogation andyou didn't want to be in trouble with the magistrate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3474"><a name="pos3474"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That partly is what I am saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3475"><a name="pos3475"></a>MR CURRAN (contd)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3476"><a name="pos3476"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I now would like to ask you a few questionsabout informants.   You said there were about, at one stage yousaid or I think it was you who said there were about 500 informersthat worked within your jurisdiction, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3477"><a name="pos3477"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did not refer to 500, but it was in that regionof about 500 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3478"><a name="pos3478"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...informers were paid for information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3479"><a name="pos3479"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3480"><a name="pos3480"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> That means that they weren't paid a set monthlysalary but when they brought information they were paid for whatthey brought?   Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3481"><a name="pos3481"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Many of them were paid a monthly amount, otherswere paid in terms of the information that they gave, and theamount was also determined by the value of the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3482"><a name="pos3482"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Was the information that they brought to youvery suspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3483"><a name="pos3483"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Certainly, we always took care to assure thatthe information from one informant was confirmed by another informant.  The informants did not know each other or one another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3484"><a name="pos3484"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...surely that if that person is paid to bringinformation to you that person needs some money to buy bread andthat that in itself is a motivation to bring information and toeven look for information which may not be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3485"><a name="pos3485"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3488"><a name="pos3488"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Is it also not correct that if an informerwas not performing and was not providing the sort of informationthat you would require, it would be necessary to kill that informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3489"><a name="pos3489"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No that would not have been necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3490"><a name="pos3490"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What would you do with an informer that hadbeen working with you and who didn't produce, say an informerthat had been working with you for two years who didn't produceinformation, did you just pat him on the back and say thanks verymuch you are now excused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3491"><a name="pos3491"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Certainly we would not have used his servicesany further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3492"><a name="pos3492"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Hadn't that informer in the course and scopeof his or her employment gathered important information aboutthe activities of the security police and what you were up toand would be a danger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3493"><a name="pos3493"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No he would not have been a danger to us becausehe knew nothing about our activities, he did not know how thesecurity police operated.   He would not have had any informationavailable to him that could hurt us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3494"><a name="pos3494"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...know that they would come to you, give youinformation about an activist, where the activist lived and thatyou then would go out and blow up the activist's house, surelyinformers knew what you were up to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3495"><a name="pos3495"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case but the informant also knewthat we could leak his name to the ANC and then he would neverbe able to work again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3496"><a name="pos3496"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...directly, you would do it indirectly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3497"><a name="pos3497"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> If we thought that this person was a threat andif the person threatened to give information about us away, thenwe would have leaked his name.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3501"><a name="pos3501"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Informants would have been persons who gatheredinformation for us say concerning school boycotts, concerningactivists, they might have been persons close to an activist,persons trusted by an activist and we recruited them in this way.  We would send some of our members to them or someone like SgtMamasela who would have approached the potential informant, wewould have offered the person payment, money.   There were informantswho were recruited locally, there were also informants who wererecruited to be sent out abroad for military training and thenupon their return they worked in a clandestine way for us.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3505"><a name="pos3505"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Finally I just would like to ask you a fewquestions about propaganda.   You said in your founding documentthat a war psychosis was created by the South African Governmentre the total onslaught in the context of the fight against theANC, liberation movements, communism and that the true picturewas never made known to the white community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3506"><a name="pos3506"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Where are you reading from Mr Curran?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3507"><a name="pos3507"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRAN::</span> From my notes, that was the general (indistinct)of his evidence.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3512"><a name="pos3512"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Is that correct, I have summarised a largesection of it and that is my understanding of what he says.  Isthat correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3513"><a name="pos3513"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Could you repeat it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3514"><a name="pos3514"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You've said that the true picture with regardto South Africa was never given to the white community, that therewas propaganda about a war psychosis in regard to the total onslaught.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3515"><a name="pos3515"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case, the true picture was that areal situation of war did exist, any person in the black areas,working in the black townships would be able to tell you the same.  The media however, the press were kept out of the black townshipson the instructions of the Government of the day, they were notallowed in the black townships.   If you found a member of themedia in the townships you took his film and you allowed him toleave the township.   They were not able to gather a true pictureof what the state of affairs had been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3516"><a name="pos3516"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...psychosis is not the true picture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3517"><a name="pos3517"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not with regard to that which the Governmentwanted to communicate to the public, the white public.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3518"><a name="pos3518"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...propaganda to create a perception of totalonslaught, wasn't that precisely what the politicians were doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3519"><a name="pos3519"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They did create the perception of total onslaughtbut they did not give the true picture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3520"><a name="pos3520"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> In your founding document I got the impressionthat you were saying that even the security police were victimsof propaganda by the Government, is that what you were saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3521"><a name="pos3521"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I've already said that the security police mainly</p>

<p class="line" id="line3525"><a name="pos3525"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> It's just in regard to that but not in regardto the total onslaught?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3526"><a name="pos3526"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3527"><a name="pos3527"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The implications then of your evidence, aswe understand it in conclusion, is that there was a police hitsquad on the highest level, acting with the authority and instructionsfrom the National Party, that it identified targets for assassination,that it reported back to the State Security Council and that theseactivities had the blessing of the State Security Council.   ThatCouncil was chaired by the President, P W Botha and that all theother portfolios were represented, except for Justice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3528"><a name="pos3528"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Justice was not involved at a joint managementsystem level.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3529"><a name="pos3529"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...State Security Council was chaired by theState President and also on that structure was the Minister ofLaw &amp; Order, at the time was Mr Vlok, and General Malan asMinister of Defence after Louis Le Grange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3530"><a name="pos3530"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Louis Le Grange was never Minister of Defence.  I can mention in addition that P W Botha in public said thatwe would eliminate terrorists and their fellow-travellers.  Hemust have known what we were doing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3541"><a name="pos3541"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> There were informants at every one of our sections,that's the black unit, the trade union unit, the churches unitand all the general organisations had informants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3542"><a name="pos3542"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would there have been informants on differentlevels, would there have been more trustworthy and less trustworthyinformants, did you classify them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3543"><a name="pos3543"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes there were certain informants where we hadalready evaluated their information and determined that underall circumstances their information was correct.  Certain otherinformants were less trustworthy or less reliable and they werecategorised in this way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3544"><a name="pos3544"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier could you page to page 28 of yourapplication?   The propaganda to which you referred which theGovernment waged, if you want to put it like that,</p>

<p class="line" id="line3547"><a name="pos3547"></a>towards the white public, could you again in terms of the questionsasked of you read the second paragraph on page 28 with regardto propaganda because this contains the core of what you saidwith regard to this propaganda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3548"><a name="pos3548"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was an excellent way in which the propagandawent in every form of Government, it can be found in the bookof President Mandela, "Long walk to freedom" on page405 where President Mandela says the following and it is quoted</p>
<p class="line" id="line3549"><a name="pos3549"></a>  "..and worked for the prison service.   He was properlybrainwashed by the Government's propaganda.   He would have believedthat we were terrorists and communists who wanted to drive thewhite man into the sea."</p>
<p class="line" id="line3550"><a name="pos3550"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> That is fine then.   Brigadier you've alreadygiven testimony in this regard but you were asked questions withregard to the reasons for the elimination of terrorists.   Youwere asked again and again for the reasons of elimination.   Therewere a general justification for the elimination of activistsunder certain circumstance given in your application at everyincident where you eliminate someone.   Is that the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3551"><a name="pos3551"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3552"><a name="pos3552"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier were your actions during 1986 and87 primarily aimed at the elimination of activists or did thesecurity branch also carry out a range of responsibilities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3553"><a name="pos3553"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> This is one of the lesser responsibilities ofthe security police.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3650"><a name="pos3650"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Let me put it to you in this way, the war wasstarted by the liberation organisations, by the ANC, by terroristsfrom neighbouring countries who were sent to South Africa.

By the end of1986 the regime had lost administrative control over large partsof the country.   It was during the mid-80's that attacks on certaintargets with no directly apparent connection to the apartheidstate took place.   In some areas these attacks resulted fromthe manner in which cadres interpreted the decision to sharplyintensify the armed struggle which would entail exercising lessrestraint and the call to take the struggle to the white areas.  Militant rhetoric in (indistinct) articles reflected the moodof the times.   The attack on South African refugees in Botswanaby the racist forces just before the conference, emphasised theneed for our movement to bleed the enemy.   Most of those cadreswho carried out bona fide operations of this nature hadreason to believe that they were operating in accordance withthe political will of the leadership of the ANC, but the apartheidregime was very quick to exploit this tactical shift with regardto its intensification of the struggle and shift and focus ofarmed operations combined with the misinterpretation of thosedecisions by some cadres, carried out a number of false flag attackson civilian targets with the sole objective of destroying theANC's claim to the moral</p>

The NEC further reaffirmed the centrality ofthe armed struggle in a national democratic revolution and theneed to further escalate armed actions and transform our offensiveinto a generalised people's war.   However, the NEC also expressedconcern at the recent spate of attacks on civilian targets, someof these attacks have been carried out by cadres of the people'sarmy Umkhonto we Sizwe inspired by anger at the regime's campaignof terror against the oppressed and democratic forces, both withinand outside South Africa.

It is a conversation withChris Hani who was a member of the Executive Council of the ANC,he was also the army commissar of MK, it was published in Sitraba(?)during December 1986 in the ...I want to ask you to read it brieflyor in part from this document.   My apologies this is from theFoundation for Equality Before the Law, I referred you to thewrong document.   Mr Chairman that's the presentation that wasmade by the Stigting ...voor die Reg, before the Truth Commission,it is part of that document before the Human Rights ViolationsCommission.   Foundation for Equality before the Law.

<p class="line" id="line3696"><a name="pos3696"></a>  it has become very clear that the enemy has no other optionin the solution of the problems of the country except violenceand we also know that</p>

<p class="line" id="line3699"><a name="pos3699"></a>   the tensions, the escalation of the militant resistance ofour people has been the violent response of the enemy.   In theface of the escalating violence of the enemy, the revolutionaryviolence of the people becomes very, very important and we knowthat the revolutionary violence of the oppressed people of ourcountry is epitomised by MK is the revolutionary violent arm ofour people.   The designation of the year as the year of MK isa clarion call to the people's army, MK, to escalate the armedstruggle.   Now you are asking what have we achieved in the militaryfield, I believe in all modesty that MK has become a permanentfeature of the struggle of our national liberation and socialemancipation, we have enriched the struggles of our people byintroducing the armed element.   The enemy statement itself hasadmitted openly that 1986 has seen an unprecedented escalationof armed struggle.   I believe we have taken the armed struggletoday to every corner of our country.   We have, for instance,spread the armed struggle to areas which in the past few yearswere not affected by armed struggle.   We know that for a longtime the armed struggle tended to be confined to the Transvaaland Natal but this year our units have spread armed activitiesto the whole of the Cape Province as well as to the Orange FreeState.  Our units have been in action in the Western Cape attackingpolice stations and installations of the enemy.   What is importantis that we have</p>

<p class="line" id="line3702"><a name="pos3702"></a>   converged with the forces on the ground, what I mean by thisis that the militant upsurge of our people has thrown up thousandsof activists, who have reached the same conclusion as the ANC,that the crucial aspect of our struggle is the armed one.   Wehave got young militants literally numbering thousands confrontingthe enemy.   At the beginning of course, these militant youthsconfronted the enemy with stones, petrol bombs but now we haveintroduced an armed element to the militancy of our young people.  We have introduced hand grenades.   I think this has deepenedthe development of the process we began to see last year, thegrowing ungovernability of our country as a result of the armedelement of the struggle, including MK and other armed units, militaryunits of our people which are born out of the struggle.   Ourpeople have utilised the skills we have imparted on them, dealwith the police, community councils, collaborationist elements,by so doing we have rendered most townships ungovernable."</p>

<p class="line" id="line3773"><a name="pos3773"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> We will come to some statistics, I'm askingyou in general.   Mr Chairman it is close to 4 o'clock.   I haveon this aspect and I think it is necessary for me to deal withthis aspect here in cross-examination(?), I will deal with itmore fully in argument unless you say to me that I should notdeal with it in much further in re-examination and only deal withit in argument.   There are a few documents which I want to askBrigadier Cronje about but I don't want to lengthen the proceedingsunnecessarily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3774"><a name="pos3774"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> I do not know whether you consider the Brigadier'sopinion to be of great importance on the contents of this documentor similar documents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3775"><a name="pos3775"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman, the only point I'm tryingto make in re-examination is Brigadier Cronje was attacked aboutthe fact that he stated in his evidence that there was a war situation.   What I'm trying to show and what he's trying to show in hisevidence, and I will proceed unless the Committee stops me todo that, is that from the view of not only the security forcesbut from the view of the liberation movements themselves, therewas a war situation in this country and that is what we are tryingto show.</p>

I don't see any evidential value added purely as, simply becausethe witness is reading to us.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3781"><a name="pos3781"></a>the witness through the document to certain portions to invitehis comments, in other words for him to underpin certain portionsof the document, but really just to read it right throughout intothe record I don't see what evidential value it acquires.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3782"><a name="pos3782"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes, Mr Chairman the intention was toask him his comment on specific parts of the document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3783"><a name="pos3783"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRAN::</span> Mr Chairman it seems as if it's possible thatMr Du Plessis has misunderstood aspects of the questions thatwere put to the Brigadier.   After the break, the very first statementthat was made by us as that it's common cause that the ANC andliberation movements waged an armed liberation struggle so we'renot for one moment contesting the fact that the ANC waged an armedliberation struggle.  That was not the context of any challengethat we put to the Brigadier, it just really related to the responsein the war that was waged in response to the ANC's war.   We arenot denying that the ANC waged a war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3784"><a name="pos3784"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> That is how I understood Mr Curran's approach,to say to the Brigadier whether the reaction of the police unitswas not a reaction to a war and was that not a declaration ofwar by themselves.   I think we all of us know sufficiently whatthe liberation movement, the struggle of the liberation movementsand so on, so I do not think it necessary to burden the recordof these proceedings on what the liberation movement was all about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3785"><a name="pos3785"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes.   Mr Chairman the only point I wantto make clear at this stage, and I know Mr Curran after the breakasked the question in a much different vein than the questionhe asked before the break.   Before the break he'd asked the question,he formulated the question as saying to</p>

<p class="line" id="line3788"><a name="pos3788"></a>Brigadier Cronje that the police waged a war on the people inthe black townships.    I feel dutybound to deal with this issueand to bring it under the Committee's attention that the factthat his evidence is that there was a war going on in this countryis confirmed by various people involved in the struggle.   I havemade that point, I don't want to belabour that point.   If theCommittee feels that I have made that point with the evidencethat I have presented now, I will deal with the other informationthat I have in my possession in argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3789"><a name="pos3789"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> The ANC's representations to the TRC woulditself reflect that the ANC had been engaged in a liberation struggleand an elaborate account of the nature and extent of that struggle.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3793"><a name="pos3793"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman yes, with respect that iswhy I posed this question now because I wanted Brigadier Cronjeto raise the points he raised and to read to the Committee specificallyin his own words what he read to the Committee now.</p>

Brigadier, the question that wasasked to you had been with regard to family members in a house,what would have happened to family members in a house in the courseof an operation, you then said that the target would not havebeen to affect family members in a house?

Mr Chairman we areindebted to the Chair and the Committee for the short adjournment.  Mr Chairman I contacted Mr Theuns Botha who told me that heis not briefed in this matter and that is why he is not here.  He advised me to contact the firm of attorneys who had initiallycontacted him, that is the firm</p>
<p class="line" id="line3959"><a name="pos3959"></a>Kamber, De Beer &amp; Goosen and I contacted this firm by telephoneand I spoke to the secretary, Ms Ria Pretorius, who told me thatthe person in charge of this matter is a Mr Goosen Jnr of thesame firm.   Mr Goosen Jnr is not available, he's writing examinationsand she said to me there's no (indistinct) present in the firmat the moment.  I explained to her what is happening and I askedher pertinently I said are you still representing the victims,she said as far as I know we are still representing them.  I saidcan I convey this to the Committee members that your firm is stillrepresenting, she said yes you can convey that.

<p class="line" id="line3965"><a name="pos3965"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Mr Mpshe on previous occasions you have fulfilledthe functions, after consultation with dependents and relativesand adduced evidence on their behalf if they were unable to doso.   It does seem that we may have to resort to that and youmust do the best you can, so now can we then commence with theleading of the evidence which might take us perhaps at least untilthe adjournment and then you can take time to consult with thewitnesses and perhaps prepare yourself to lead evidence on theirbehalf when the need arises.   You may even have to consult themafter the first witness has given evidence but then you wouldexercise your experience and judgment in the matter, Mr Mpshe.  You will not be prevented from calling any witness after youhave received instructions and it becomes necessary to put questionsto somebody.

Mr Chairman I just want to applyfor the inclusion of two other Acts on page 112 just to be safeMr Chairman please, arson and possession of illegal explosives.  Brigadier Cronje on page 113 your application begins, couldyou tell the Committee with regard to your statement here whatyour involvement had been with the death of Pete Ntuli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3982"><a name="pos3982"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chair the Mbkhoto was a movement in Kwandabeleof which Pete Ntuli was the leader.  The ANC attempted to destabiliseKwandabele, this occurred by means of the burning down of housesand schools as well as boycotts and school boycotts.   I receivedinstructions to eliminate Pete Ntuli since he was destabilisingthe area in Kwandabele and in effect advanced the purposes ofthe ANC.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3985"><a name="pos3985"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier could you stop there, you don't needto read the next section it has to do with Trevits and we've hadsufficient evidence in that regard.   Could you possibly expandon your instructions, can you remember who gave you the instructionsand if you cannot remember could you tell the Committee or couldyou sketch for the Committee the possibilities as you see thistoday who might have been the source of these instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3986"><a name="pos3986"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I'm not entirely sure how this came about butthe most likely is that I would have made presentation to Trevitsmyself or that I did so in co-operation with Special Forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3987"><a name="pos3987"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier could you continue at the final paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3988"><a name="pos3988"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The information to us was that Ntuli was involvedin a variety of unrest incitements, murder, arson, unrest, seriousassaults, tortures, intimidation, theft, the illegal possessionof firearms and consumer boycotts.   He planned the consumer boycottsso that he would walk into a place and he would simply close theshop.   He would cut off the electrical supply to the populationor even the water supplies to the population.   It was thereforenecessary to achieve stability in the area and to counter theANC's plan of destabilisation to eliminate Ntuli.   Pete Ntuli'scase had been discussed at several (indistinct) at the Joint InformationCentre which was a sub-section of the Joint Management Systemwhich consisted only of the police, military intelligence, thearmy itself, only the intelligence community as such were involvedin this Joint Information Centre.   All the security informationavailable had been discussed, as well as all the incidents and</p>

<p class="line" id="line3991"><a name="pos3991"></a>possible actions were discussed.   The decisions then made werereferred to the State Security Council who then took the finaldecision.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line3992"><a name="pos3992"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> A moment, you are saying that this was discussed,were you personally present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3993"><a name="pos3993"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I had sitting on this Joint Information Centre,I was personally present.   It is possible that the decision withregard to Pete Ntuli would have been taken in the Joint InformationCentre and that it would have been confirmed by the State SecurityCouncil via Trevits.   I made several recommendations that PeteNtuli should have been detained under security legislation butI was told time and again that this was not possible since MinisterHeunis, at that time of Constitutional Development, was opposedto the detention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3994"><a name="pos3994"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> We will return to this particular matter withregard to which I will question you.    Brigadier, Dantjie VanWyk at that time in 86 was in charge of a special investigatingteam with regard to unrest in Kwandabele and working with himwere Sgt Gouws and W/O Oosthuizen, they investigated in particularthen the Mbkhoto incidents or incidents in which the Mbkhoto movementwere involved.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4001"><a name="pos4001"></a>1b ANSWER: /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line4002"><a name="pos4002"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 557 J H CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line4003"><a name="pos4003"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> A specially built bomb was acquired from JoeVerster of Special Forces which was the run-up to the later BSB.  There were particular preparations made with regard to the particularmodel of car which Pete Ntuli drove in, which is a Toyota Cressida,so that it would have been possible to fit the bomb to the bottomof this vehicle.   We co-operated with the SADF Special Forcesin terms of the general instructions given by Brigadier Schoon.  Myself, Captain Hechter and Captain Jaap Van Jaarsveld wentwith the bomb to Kwandabele.   Later in the afternoon, CaptainChris Kendall, the Branch Commanding Officer of this SecurityPolice in Bronkelspruit who was responsible for Kwandabele, alsoarrived.   Gouws and Oosthuizen were attached to the Murder &amp;Armed Robbery section of the South African Police which investigatedthe activities of the Mbkhoto in Kwandabele under Brigadier DantjieVan Wyk.   We met Mr Oosthuizen and Gouws at Siabuswa(?), whichwas then the seat of the Kwandabele Government.   We waited allday to see how we could attach the bomb to Pete Ntuli's vehicle.  That particular evening there was a meeting at the house ofthe Chief Minister in the Ministerial complex in Kwandabele.  There was an open piece of veld across from the Ministerial complexfrom where we watched the complex.   When it had become dark,myself, Hechter and Captain Kendall drove to the complex in CaptainKendall's vehicle.   We parked next to Pete Ntuli's vehicle andI sent Kendall to the Chief Minister to tell him that I wouldlike to meet with the Chief Minister, whom I had not met yet atthat time.   While Kendall was in the house of the Chief Minister,Hechter sneaked underneath Ntuli's Cressida vehicle and mountedthe bomb.   The Minister of Police, Mr Nglameni, then came out</p>

<p class="line" id="line4005"><a name="pos4005"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 558 J H CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line4006"><a name="pos4006"></a>of the Chief Minister's house.   I approached him and greetedhim and we had a conversation.   After the bomb was planted underNtuli's vehicle, we returned in Kendall's vehicle.   We then droveback to the open piece of veld in front of the main gates of theMinisterial complex.   It was then agreed that Oosthuizen andGouws would handle the two distance detonators.   These distance-controlleddetonators were set so that the bomb would explode in a distantpart of the road which Ntuli normally used.   There was a mechanismto prevent that innocent persons would be hurt.   The bomb wouldonly explode 30 seconds after the detonator had been set so thatthe bomb would explode in an unbuilt area, which indeed did happen.  After the bomb exploded we drove out to the base of Gouws andOosthuizen which was about four kilometres from Siabuswa.   Whenwe arrived at the base we received information from the policeradio with regard to the explosion and with Brigadier Van Wykand some of his staff, we returned to the scene of the explosion.  The Commissioner of Police of Kwandabele, Brigadier Van Niekerk,also arrived at the scene.   The next day I went to BrigadierCoetzee, the Commissioner's office, and the Kwandabele Governmentclaimed that I was responsible for the bomb.  The matter was investigatedby the head of the Detective Services, General Schutte - the Chiefof CID I would presume.   I was never questioned in this regard.  I had to hand in a report and I was not involved in the legalinquest or gave testimony at the legal inquest.   Special Forceswould initially have performed this operation with us, but inthe event we only received the bomb from Special Forces.   Mbkhotoacted in a similar manner to the ANC and attempted to destabilisethe area in a manner similar to</p>

<p class="line" id="line4009"><a name="pos4009"></a>that of the ANC.   This occurred by means of burning down housesand schools and by means of consumer and school boycotts.   ThenMbkhoto and the ANC had the same purposes, namely political unrest,murder, assault and destabilisation.   Shops were closed, waterand lights were cut off.   We received information that Pete Ntuliand his Mbkhoto on one particular evening burned down a houseand that two children came out of the house and that Pete Ntulithrew the children back into the fire.   This case was investigated,with no consequences.   We received information that Pete Ntuliand the Mbkhoto's intentions were to make Kwandabele ungovernableand to make the existing Government ineffective and to destabiliseKwandabele.   The Mbkhoto of Pete Ntuli had the same destabilisingeffect in Kwandabele as the ANC.   In effect the Mbkhoto achievedthe purposes of the ANC with regard to the destabilisation ofKwandabele.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line4010"><a name="pos4010"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> For a moment Brigadier for further claritycould you explain to the Committee whether you knew or whetheryou could remember with what purpose the Mbkhoto were founded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4011"><a name="pos4011"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The Mbkhoto were founded with the purpose ofassisting the Government of Kwandabele towards the purpose ofindependence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4012"><a name="pos4012"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> With regard to the deeds of the Mbkhoto, didthey achieve this purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4013"><a name="pos4013"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No in their actions they acted against the Governmentof Kwandabele and they did exactly what the ANC did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4014"><a name="pos4014"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Could we then return to your testimony at thelast paragraph on page 118?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4015"><a name="pos4015"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Pete Ntuli's activities was therefore aimed,by</p>

<p class="line" id="line4018"><a name="pos4018"></a>means of the activities of the Mbkhoto, against the then Governmentof Kwandabele and advanced the purposes of the ANC in the processof destabilisation.   The Government of Kwandabele at that timeserved the purposes or had a positive attitude towards the SouthAfrican Government.   The Mbkhoto worked against the politicalpurposes of the Government.    I may mention that if there wasno peace in Qwandebele they would not have achieved independenceand Pete Ntuli must have known this.   His elimination would haveadvanced the independence of Kwandabele.   I want to mention inaddition that I was convinced in my heart, with information availableto me, that Pete Ntuli was in fact a double agent who gave theimpression that he worked for the South African Government butthat in fact his activities were the very opposite of that.  I also ascertained that the brother of Pete Ntuli, (whose namethe interpreter could not hear) who was a Warrant Officer in theCar Theft Unit in Springs, that Pete Ntuli was accused of armedrobbery, that he was found guilty and in fact sentenced to deathand that during the course of the court case there had been testimonywhich was robbed was used to fund the ANC.   This confirmed mysuspicion that Pete Ntuli was in fact working for the ANC. </p>
<p class="line" id="line4019"><a name="pos4019"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier let's return to certain aspects withregard to which you have given testimony.   Can you remember whatthe position of the Kwandabele Government had been with regardto independence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4020"><a name="pos4020"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The Kwandabele Government supported the notionof independence for Kwandabele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4021"><a name="pos4021"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Were they supported by the South African Government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4022"><a name="pos4022"></a>1b ANSWER: /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line4023"><a name="pos4023"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 561 J H CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line4024"><a name="pos4024"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes they were supported by the South AfricanGovernment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4025"><a name="pos4025"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Was Pete Ntuli a Minister?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4026"><a name="pos4026"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was the Minister of Home Affairs of the KwandabeleGovernment at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4027"><a name="pos4027"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Can you remember what the attitude had beenof the population of Kwandabele with regard to independence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4028"><a name="pos4028"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The people of Kwandabele were entirely opposedto independence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4029"><a name="pos4029"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would you know why they were opposed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4030"><a name="pos4030"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They were opposed because of the acts of theUDF and the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4031"><a name="pos4031"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier, the independence of Kwandabele wouldthat have been part of the apartheid policy of the South AfricanGovernment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4032"><a name="pos4032"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Indeed.  In addition they wanted independencebecause the idea would have been that if there were to be votesin the future then the people of Kwandabele would not be ableto vote in South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4033"><a name="pos4033"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Can you remember, there has been testimonyin this regard, but just elaborate on this again, what would havebeen the state of unrest in Kwandabele from about 1984?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4034"><a name="pos4034"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> There had been serious unrest in Kwandabele from1984.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4035"><a name="pos4035"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You have also given testimony that the Mbkhotowere founded with the apparent purpose of supporting the KwandabeleGovernment with the purpose of achieving the independence of Kwandabele,is that the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4036"><a name="pos4036"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4037"><a name="pos4037"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Again to elaborate on your testimony with regardto the Mbkhoto, although this was the purpose of their</p>

<p class="line" id="line4040"><a name="pos4040"></a>founding, what exactly did the Mbkhoto do and to what extent didthey deviate from this initial purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4041"><a name="pos4041"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They entirely deviated from the original purposeof founding, they became Pete Ntuli's political force, they committedarson and murder and arranged consumer and school boycotts.  In a particular case Pete Ntuli, with the Mbkhoto, entered a schoolwhich was quite calm at the time and where the people were goingto school, Ntuli hit and drove the teachers in the children outof the school with sjamboks and knopkieries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4042"><a name="pos4042"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> To what extent did they Mbkhoto, of whom PeteNtuli was the leader, operate in a manner similar to that of theANC and the UDF in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4043"><a name="pos4043"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They operated in exactly the same manner as theANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4044"><a name="pos4044"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What effect did their activities have on theSouth African and Kwandabele Governments' efforts to advance independencefor Kwandabele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4045"><a name="pos4045"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It put a spoke in the wheels entirely for theprocess of independence because it was not possible to grant independenceif the area was entirely destabilised, they therefore worked entirelyin opposition to the political purposes of the Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4046"><a name="pos4046"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier, you have given testimony that yourequested that Ntuli be arrested and that Minister Heunis wouldnot allow this.   Can you explain this or could you think whatthe explanation might have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4047"><a name="pos4047"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Pete Ntuli was probably a thorn in the fleshof the South African Government and they lost control over him</p>
<p class="line" id="line4048"><a name="pos4048"></a>entirely.   It was not possible to arrest him or to detain himsince the South African Government, to use the English</p>

<p class="line" id="line4056"><a name="pos4056"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did they also propagate(?) him as being oneof their supporters?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4128"><a name="pos4128"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> "In that time, the chief strategy of the ANCand PAC was to make the country, and in particular Kwandabele,ungovernable by means of unrest, arson, attacks with hand grenadesand other arms, public violence, school boycotts and strikes.  Mr Pete Ntuli, with the assistance of an organisation knownas the Mbkhoto, acted in an intense and aggressive manner to participatein this process.   Although Mr Ntuli was not known as an ANC supporterand although his organisation claimed to be opposed to the ANC,I had to take into account the following facts; Kwandabele wasturned into a boiling-pot of violence by ANC and PAC activists,their purpose was to make the country entirely ungovernable andthis purpose they largely achieved."</p>

In this instancehe has testified about that so, a final question, Judge Wilsonasked you a question, this was with regard to the ANC and a particularquote of Chris Hani which you read yesterday, in which he claimedthat an MK unit had been responsible for the death of Pete Ntuli.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4134"><a name="pos4134"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We were aware of this claim by the ANC but ofcourse this suited us, we wanted to leave the impression thatthe ANC had been responsible for the death of Pete Ntuli and forthis particular incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4135"><a name="pos4135"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> It would have suited the purposes of the Governmentthat they did not have to eliminate their own man, or apparentlytheir own man?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4141"><a name="pos4141"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier, I think it was fairly known andobvious during that time that during the operation of Mbkhotothat Kwandabele was highly destabilised but isn't it so that ingoing about doing his business in the way that he was doing, PeteNtuli was in fact trying to strengthen the Kwandabele Governmentand drive it towards independence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4142"><a name="pos4142"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chair, Pete Ntuli with his Mbkhoto in actualfact did the ANC's work for it.   He could not at that stage havebeen working for the Kwandabele Government.   I felt, and it wasmy honest opinion, that Pete Ntuli was directly opposed to independenceand the Kwandabele Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4143"><a name="pos4143"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> If the media, if things which were reportedin the media about what he was doing, if those things were correct,there is no doubt that he was sowing havoc in Kwandabele.

<p class="line" id="line4146"><a name="pos4146"></a>precisely what, as you say the ANC would have wanted, namely destabilisation,but the way I understand Mr Ntuli's activities would be that heachieved in a rather unwitting manner destabilisation.   Yourevidence tends to suggest that he deliberately wanted to achievethe same results as the ANC, do you understand my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4147"><a name="pos4147"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Whether he intended it Mr Chair I don't know,but it definitely created the impression with me and the Governmentthat he was destabilising the whole area for his own purposes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4148"><a name="pos4148"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Now don't you deal differently with a personwho unwittingly, unwisely, foolishly, causes destabilisation asopposed to a person who like an ANC person deliberately bringsabout destabilisation?   Why didn't you re-educate him or educatehim properly and call him in, he was on the South African Governmentand say to him don't do this because you see you achieve the resultsof the ANC, rather than eliminating him, this is the point I'mtrying to make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4149"><a name="pos4149"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Pete Ntuli was a member of Cabinet and it wouldcertainly have been the duty of Government to do that, I couldnot go and speak to Ntuli in that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4150"><a name="pos4150"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> But yes, you might have but would it not havebeen within your task to, as a solution, to suggest and say thatinstead of eliminating him let him be dealt with in this way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4151"><a name="pos4151"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is why I suggested Pete Ntuli's detentionin accordance with security legislation, I wanted to withdrawhim from society in that way but Government did not want to dothat.   I think in reports about his involvement and I certainlythought that if Government thought it necessary, they would havespoken to him about it.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4213"><a name="pos4213"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The bomb which was made was particularly designedfor the Toyota Cressida vehicle and would then have attached somewhereunderneath the driver's seat and would then have been fitted,I suppose with little clamps, but Captain Hechter would be ableto give you far clearer evidence in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4214"><a name="pos4214"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> On page 115, paragraph 2 of your application,you state that with regard to the design of the bomb to fit theToyota Cressida model?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4221"><a name="pos4221"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They had a technical section, I don't know whoexactly would have done it, but the bomb was provided by Joe Versterwho handed it to Captain Hechter.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4225"><a name="pos4225"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The contents of my report gave the reason formy presence, namely to visit the office of the Security Branchin Kwandabele to do an inspection at that office.   That I hadvisited the home of the Chief Minister and that the reason thereforwas that I wanted to meet him personally just in general and thatI had general tasks to perform in Kwandabele.   I made no referenceto the bomb in the report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4226"><a name="pos4226"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> For whom was this report intended?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4227"><a name="pos4227"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I handed the report to General Schutte who wasthe investigating officer in the inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4228"><a name="pos4228"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...you made this report and submitted it toGeneral Schutte, you knew that the contents thereof were untrue?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4230"><a name="pos4230"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Seeing that General Schutte was investigatingand you knew as a police officer that he wants all informationabout what happened, why didn't you mention it?</p>

Did you believe in this information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4235"><a name="pos4235"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Certainly at that time I believed this informationthat Pete Ntuli did destabilise the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4236"><a name="pos4236"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What in particular had Pete Ntuli done to bringabout this belief in you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4237"><a name="pos4237"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was responsible for consumer boycotts, sayfor instance he would walk into a shop and tell the people toclose the shop down, that he would cut off their water and electricity.  He was, therefore, in fact busy with the destabilisation ofthe area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4238"><a name="pos4238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> You are really saying all this because theseare reports you'd received from somebody else about him walkinginto the shops, compelling shops to close down, this is informationsomebody else gave you, is that not so?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4242"><a name="pos4242"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> This is the case, he was placed there by theGovernment but his actions were of such a nature that the policyof apartheid of the then Government with regard to the independencewhich they wanted to achieve for</p>

<p class="line" id="line4264"><a name="pos4264"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That was information which we had received.  The matter had been investigated by the investigative officers. I do not believe that anything came of the investigation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4349"><a name="pos4349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> That is so Mr Chairman and members of the Committee,I consulted with them during the tea-break.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4350"><a name="pos4350"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> In that case Brigadier, you have consistentlymaintained that one of the objectives of Mbkhoto in destabilisingthe Kwandabele community was to encourage school boycotts.   Isit not probably true that Mbkhoto's objective was to crush schoolboycotts as they were perceived by Kwandabele Cabinet to furtherthe cause of the ANC mobilising the youth against independence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4351"><a name="pos4351"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I have also said Chair that I have informationof a particular case where Pete Ntuli and Mbkhoto with sjamboksand knopkerries, chased children and teachers out of a particularschool.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4355"><a name="pos4355"></a>the teachers was it for purposes of encouraging a boycott?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4356"><a name="pos4356"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I could only deduce that he did not want thechildren to be at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4357"><a name="pos4357"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Were they conducting a boycott at the schoolwhen he arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4358"><a name="pos4358"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No they were in the school with their schoolbooksand so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4359"><a name="pos4359"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Is it not true that Mr Ntuli was concededby the South African Government as a thorn in its flesh as hehad actually overstepped the mark.   He had been put there totry and encourage the Kwandabele community to (indistinct) independence,in fact what he did was he unleashed such terror in the atrocitieswhich he committed against his own community, the whole communityand the turning against the concept of independence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4360"><a name="pos4360"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> This is the case, he was in fact a thorn in theflesh for the South African Government, and through his actionshe caused problems for their policy or caused it to fail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4361"><a name="pos4361"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Therefore it would be highly unlikely thatthe Government decided to eliminate him because it suspected himof being a double agent, it simply was sitting with an embarrassingproblem, not that Mr Ntuli was ever perceived by the South AfricanGovernment as being an agent of the ANC or the UDF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4362"><a name="pos4362"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I could grant that that would not have been themain reason for his elimination.   The first reason would havebeen the true reason.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4419"><a name="pos4419"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> To some extent they started as a cultural organisationbut I would say that through the course of events and becauseof Pete Ntuli they become more politically active than culturally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4420"><a name="pos4420"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Would you therefore regard them as a politicalorganisation as you would like the ANC, the PAC, would they qualifyin that status?</p>

You will find thaton page 234 of his application.   Mr Chairman before we start,it seems that the one aspect of these applications in the pressureunder which they were drawn that didn't receive the attentionthat it should have received was the specific deeds and the identificationthereof.   In the case of Captain Hechter I would like to justrefer you to page 234, the reference to "attempted murder"should actually be a reference to "murder".</p>
<p class="line" id="line4425"><a name="pos4425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> If it is convenient at some stage for you tosubmit just the pages that you wish amended, more particularlyreflecting the offences because when amnesty is considered, specialattention can only be given to the offences specifically mentioned.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4433"><a name="pos4433"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter I am not going to take youthrough the whole matter because it is exactly the same as BrigadierCronje's evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4434"><a name="pos4434"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4435"><a name="pos4435"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter, regarding the evidence aboutthe political motivation, do you agree with Brigadier Cronje'sevidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4436"><a name="pos4436"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case, where the Brigadier cannotremember everything perhaps I can remember that during June orJuly, the period around the burning point, the Mbkhoto went outone night and burned down 50 houses.   There were about 30 peopledied that night or were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4437"><a name="pos4437"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter then there are one or two furtheraspects that you could perhaps explain to the Committee.   Letus start on page 237, you refer to a specially built bomb, canyou please explain a bit more about this bomb to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4438"><a name="pos4438"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman, this bomb was built by the SpecialForces of the SADF for this specific operation.   If I remembercorrectly, Joe Verster pertinently asked me what kind of vehiclewas used, I had to go and find out what the registration numberwas so that we can determine the number of the chassis and sothat they could build a ready-made bomb for this specific vehicle.  This bomb was specifically built with plastic, plasticine, itwas about 4kg, it was</p>
<p class="line" id="line4439"><a name="pos4439"></a>2b designed /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line4440"><a name="pos4440"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 590 J HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line4441"><a name="pos4441"></a>designed in such a way that it could be mounted on the vehiclewithout the necessity of light, without you having to see whatyou were doing exactly.   The precise measurements are difficultto tell, it was approximately twice as large as a normal foliopage, I would say it was about 2-3cms thick.   The explosiveswere in a black tin or plate covering which was in a square form.  This bomb also had a safety time mechanism.   After the bombwas mounted you pulled out the safety pin after which the bombwould be activated 30 minutes later.   The bomb also had two separatepush buttons to let the bomb explode to prevent a malfunction.  After the button had been pushed, on request, there was a 30second time lapse.   We suspected where Mr Ntuli would be thatday approximately and we knew the route he took to his house.  We also knew that he was a person who normally drove at onespeed.   He kept to the speed limit.   We thought if there wasa 30 minute time lapse, sorry 30 second time lapse he would bein an open piece of veld and we wanted the bomb to explode inthat area that was not built up, but we did not want to followyou so that we would be noticed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4442"><a name="pos4442"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Why did you want the bomb to explode in theopen area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4443"><a name="pos4443"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> If that bomb would have exploded in a built uparea, civilians who were not involved would have been injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4444"><a name="pos4444"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain, you personally mounted the bomb isthat correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4445"><a name="pos4445"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4446"><a name="pos4446"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain can you remember an incident some timeafter this incident, was this incident discussed with you</p>

<p class="line" id="line4449"><a name="pos4449"></a>later on, did you go back to the place where it happened, canyou remember anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4450"><a name="pos4450"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> What exactly are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4451"><a name="pos4451"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Was there ever a discussion with any of thecommanding officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4452"><a name="pos4452"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> A long time afterwards, as a matter of fact onlyrecently before Colonel Van Jaarsveld became a witness, we discussedthe Ntuli case and he...(end of side 2)...with Brigadier Cronjewhen he received a call from the main office to go there and discussthe Ntuli case.   He left Captain Van Jaarsveld in the officeand went to the main office.   Just after that when he came backI was called and I received the task to eliminate Mr Ntuli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4453"><a name="pos4453"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter did you ever receive verificationafter the event from anybody above you that the people higherup in the ranks knew about this instruction, this order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4454"><a name="pos4454"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It is difficult to remember Mr Chairman, I suspector I believe that Brigadier Cronje told me or mentioned it tome that we received an order to eliminate Mr Ntuli.   I cannotmention a name, I can't imagine that a name was mentioned, I can'tremember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4455"><a name="pos4455"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter did you, during any discussionswith Basie Smit, discuss this with him, was there any mentionof this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4456"><a name="pos4456"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> After Brigadier Smit or General Smit took overat the Safety Branch he called me, W/O Van Vuuren and ColonelLoots and he asked us to go with him to Kwandabele.   The fourof us went to Kwandabele with his vehicle, I was driving it.  When we came into Siabuswa on that road, we drove over the holethat at that stage had already been</p>

<p class="line" id="line4459"><a name="pos4459"></a>fixed.   Then General Smit said "Hechter this is your monument".  I did not admit that and he turned around and he said "don'ttry to make a fool of me I did read the reports" but I stilldenied it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4460"><a name="pos4460"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did he at any stage repudiate it?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4463"><a name="pos4463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> As far as you were concerned where did youget your specific instructions in connection with this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4464"><a name="pos4464"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The instruction came directly from the Brigadier,Brigadier Cronje.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4465"><a name="pos4465"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Do I understand the position that nobody challengedyour actions or made any comment about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4466"><a name="pos4466"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As the Brigadier gave testimony, he gave in areport and at the same time I also handed in a report in whichI mentioned why I was there and I said I was there as the Brigadier'sdriver.   At that time a senior officer had instructions fromhead office that senior offices were not supposed to enter theseareas without a driver, so they were not allowed to enter theseareas on their own.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4475"><a name="pos4475"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What I am saying is were you directed or instructedby anybody to tell untruth as you did in your report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4476"><a name="pos4476"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It wasn't quite an untruth I just left out someparts of it, I simply said that I accompanied the Brigadier anddidn't expand on it and no one asked me any further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4477"><a name="pos4477"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You told them that you accompanied him as yourdriver?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4480"><a name="pos4480"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> In many cases when he entered dangerous areas,areas where there had been unrest, certain areas were more dangerousthan others and from head office we received instructions thatour senior officers were not supposed to enter these areas withouta driver.   They were not allowed to do so.   In every case wherehe entered such an area I did accompany him so this was the normalcourse of events, it didn't appear as strange to anyone or outsideof the ordinary to anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4481"><a name="pos4481"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> But were you driving on this particular day?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4484"><a name="pos4484"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> When a bomb like that explodes, there is a lotof burning involved.   This is probably not arson as such buta lot of fire is involved in such an incident, yes we do mentionarson.   I assumed that there would have been quite</p>

<p class="line" id="line4488"><a name="pos4488"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain there is no evidence by yourself aboutarson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4489"><a name="pos4489"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4490"><a name="pos4490"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You testified that Mbkhoto at one stage burned50 houses and killed about 30 people.   Were any arrests madefor this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4491"><a name="pos4491"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chair there were, as Brigadier Cronje alreadymentioned, after the problem started the full-scale problems inKwandabele a special investigative team was sent to Kwandabelewho had to deal with all of these activities.   There were manydossiers but whether there were any arrests made I would not beable to answer.   I do know from my conversations with Sgt Gouwsand W/O Oosthuizen, who at that time were part of the investigativeteam, that there were large numbers of dossiers.   Intimidationwould be similar, you wouldn't openly discuss some things thathappened to you, you would have been careful to discuss Pete Ntulior to make any claims with regard to Pete Ntuli in public.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4492"><a name="pos4492"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> In your opinion then Captain would you saythat that incident where 30 people died was probably the laststraw in the South African Government's neck which resulted inthe Government deciding to eliminate Mr Ntuli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4493"><a name="pos4493"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chair that's very difficult for me to say whatthe reactions of Government would have been to that particularact, I wouldn't be able to tell you.   One can assume what theirreaction was but you can't verify it.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4498"><a name="pos4498"></a>embarrassment to the then National Party Government and not becausecertain political objectives were to be achieved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4499"><a name="pos4499"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would not be able to answer you in this regard,but that he was indeed an embarrassment for the Government thatis a fact.   In addition he achieved the purposes of the ANC quiteobviously, that was quite clear to everybody.  At the time thecomrades were very strongly present in Kwandabele, for one tomake a distinction between when a comrade or when Mr Ntuli burneddown a house in Kwandabele, that was very difficult.   As faras we were concerned, the Security Branch, he simply advancedthe purposes of the ANC at that time by making the area ungovernable,entirely ungovernable.   At that time there were major discussions,negotiations, with a view to the independence of Kwandabele butin view of the unrest this would not have been possible.  It wasfirst necessary to stabilise the area.   If I'm not entirely mistaken,shortly after this incident the Kwandabele members of Parliamentwent down to Cape Town to negotiate with the National Party withregard to the independence, but this is only what I have heard,this is hearsay I only heard from the investigative officers thatthe Cabinet members had gone down to Cape Town.   There mightbe testimony in this regard I see there are members of the thenGovernment available here but I wouldn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4500"><a name="pos4500"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would you say that the Kwandabele Governmentknew about the plan to eliminate Pete Ntuli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4501"><a name="pos4501"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I doubt that very strongly but that of courseis only my perception and when I said I was too small, too insignificantI mean that I was too low down in the hierarchy of command tobe aware or informed of such decisions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4506"><a name="pos4506"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chair yes, this particular bomb - as I've alreadygiven testimony - was designed with this particular purpose inmind.   It was placed immediately under Mr Ntuli's seat on theoutside of the vehicle, directly under his driver's seat.   Itwas shaped in such a way or built in such a way that one coulduse a screw to attach it to the vehicle as such which meant thatthe bomb for instance, while the vehicle was driving and it wasimpossible to detonate the bomb, then the bomb wouldn't have fallenoff the vehicle.   It was purpose built so that in the dark, withoutbeing able to see anything, I could screw it onto the vehicle.</p>

Mr Chairman I may however also want to place on record that asfar as the Attorney-General is concerned, as we understand it,their view is that they refuse their witnesses leave to testifyeven of their own accord at these hearings.  As I understand it,they have an agreement with the specific witnesses and the witnesseswould breach the agreement if they testify here.   I just wantto put that on record as well.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4663"><a name="pos4663"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier could you explain to us what happenedin this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4664"><a name="pos4664"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Joe Mamasela infiltrated a group of young activistsin Mamelodi.   He informed me that they wanted to receive militarytraining abroad and a meeting was arranged between myself andColonel Shamadiaz(?) of Special Forces where we discussed thismatter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4665"><a name="pos4665"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier can I just stop you here.   Did JoeMamasela tell you whether he had convinced the young activiststo receive training or whether they volunteered to receive thistraining?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4666"><a name="pos4666"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No he said that they volunteered, they approachedhim.   To inform the Committee, Mamasela always presented himselfas a member of MK that is why it was easy for him, it was regularlythat people had asked him questions such as these.   A Kombi wasmade available to Mamasela, I must in addition say that from theZeerust office I discussed this with Crouse and Loots that ona particular evening we would meet at the Security Branch officesin Zeerust.    I made this Kombi available to Mamasela and hearranged to take these MK soldiers, or intended MK soldiers, acrossthe</p>

<p class="line" id="line4669"><a name="pos4669"></a>border at Nietverdient to Botswana for training purposes. </p>
<p class="line" id="line4670"><a name="pos4670"></a>Mamasela left with the Kombi.   After he had picked up these persons,Captain Hechter and myself followed them in my car to watch theKombi to ensure Mamasela's safety.   Mamasela gave these personsbeer and then at the Zeerust Security Branch I and Hechter contactedLoots, Crouse and Shamadiaz of the SADF.   I met Mamasela in townand told him to drive the Nietverdient road and then to turn downthat particular dirt road, close to Nietverdient.   Mamasela wentahead, Hechter, Loots, Crouse and myself then followed them ina Kombi.   Mamasela followed this lonely little bush path as arranged,then we parked behind Mamasela's road but there was a furtherKombi at the scene with four of Shamadiaz' operatives, whom Ido not know, all of them were wearing balaclava caps and theywere awaiting Mamasela at that point.   When he stopped, theytook the persons out of this vehicle, they were under the influenceof alcohol to a considerable extent at that time.   As they weretaken out of the Kombi, the members of the military pressed themdown to the ground and injected them with something.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line4671"><a name="pos4671"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier would you know what the contentsof the injections were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4672"><a name="pos4672"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I have no idea.   They were then put backin the Kombi and then we drove to an area in Bophutatswana.  This Kombi with the trainee soldiers was pushed down an inclineand then the Kombi was filled with explosives and blown up.  The purpose was to let it appear as if the intended MK soldiersdrove up against a wall or against the incline and blew themselvesup.   The Botswana police investigated this car wreck and theremains of the persons in it.   There were some newspaper reports,after which</p>

<p class="line" id="line4675"><a name="pos4675"></a>General Victor phoned me to ask me whether it had been our</p>
<p class="line" id="line4676"><a name="pos4676"></a>staff who were hurt.   I told him that was the case.   He congratulatedme with the operation.   The particular young persons were verykeen to receive military training.   The purpose of the operationwas to eliminate the prospective activists before they could leavethe country so that it could serve to frighten other prospectiveactivists from joining MK.   A further purpose was to eliminateprospective MK soldiers who at a later stage could return as well-trainedterrorists and commit acts of terror.   I would have had no ideawhere they would then have committed these acts of terror.   While I cannot remember the specific detail, I do remember thatthese activists probably had all been involved in school boycotts,consumer boycotts and arson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4677"><a name="pos4677"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Thank you Brigadier.   In your view, was thereany other way in which you could have dealt with these prospectivesoldiers under these circumstances in order to prevent them fromreceiving training and then to return to commit acts of terror?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4678"><a name="pos4678"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, we did not see any other way of dealing withthem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4679"><a name="pos4679"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier, the political purposes of the actyou have already set out from page 91 and thereafter what thepolitical purposes were.   Do you confirm these as set out?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4689"><a name="pos4689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Do you know the names of these young people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4690"><a name="pos4690"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I do not know their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4691"><a name="pos4691"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> To your knowledge did anybody have a list ofwho they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4692"><a name="pos4692"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mamasela would have had a list or at least hewould have known the names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4693"><a name="pos4693"></a><span class="speaker">MR ?::</span> Can I mention we are on record for this matterjust in case you are unaware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4694"><a name="pos4694"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4695"><a name="pos4695"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> So this entire exercise was brought into beingas a result of a report from Mamasela that these youngsters wantedto go for military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4696"><a name="pos4696"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4697"><a name="pos4697"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> No attempt was made to get hold of these youngsters,to talk them out of it, to educate them differently, no attemptwas made to treat them in that fashion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4698"><a name="pos4698"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mamasela had instructions to talk to them andit turned out that they were all extremely convinced of theirintentions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4699"><a name="pos4699"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Do you know whether in fact Mamasela enticedthem to join, you wouldn't know would you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4700"><a name="pos4700"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I would not know, but his instructions werespecifically that he was not supposed to entice people to joinMK or any such actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4701"><a name="pos4701"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Mamasela being the kind of man he was, couldyou place any reliance on what he would say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4702"><a name="pos4702"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At that time I trusted Mamasela entirely, hehad given me no reason for not trusting him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4705"><a name="pos4705"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Where did you get the report that these</p>
<p class="line" id="line4706"><a name="pos4706"></a>youngsters were involved in boycotts, school boycotts and activitiesof that kind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4707"><a name="pos4707"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Again that would have been the source reportsas well as Mamasela's own reports.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4708"><a name="pos4708"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Mamasela's reports, were they oral or in writing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4709"><a name="pos4709"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That would have been written reports.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4710"><a name="pos4710"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> To you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4711"><a name="pos4711"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No he would have given it to the particular sectionwho worked with these matters, he would have given the reportsto them.   I would, however, have had access to these reports.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4712"><a name="pos4712"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> In this case who would it be to whom he madethis report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4713"><a name="pos4713"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> These would have been the B Section who dealtwith the Black Power matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4714"><a name="pos4714"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> ...obviously before the plan was implemented?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4715"><a name="pos4715"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not necessarily, he might have given reportsprior to this on their activities.   His report that they wantedto receive military training, that would have been an oral orverbal report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4716"><a name="pos4716"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> You made no attempt to prosecute them either,did you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4717"><a name="pos4717"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At that time I had no testimony which I coulduse in a case against them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4718"><a name="pos4718"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> With the facilities available to you, youcould have quite easily installed tape recorders into the Kombi,you could have recorded their conversations with Mamasela, couldyou not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4719"><a name="pos4719"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Again I would have to use Mamasela as a witness,</p>
<p class="line" id="line4720"><a name="pos4720"></a>3b which /...</p>

<p class="line" id="line4722"><a name="pos4722"></a>which I could not do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4723"><a name="pos4723"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> We come back to the position that we'vehad in previous cases, that once you used Mamasela, the peoplehe dealt with were sentenced to death.   Is that the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4724"><a name="pos4724"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not in every case Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4725"><a name="pos4725"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> I thought that everyone you've told usso far where Mamasela dealt with people, they had to be killedto cover for Mamasela.   Is that not the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4726"><a name="pos4726"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, Mamasela did many other investigations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4727"><a name="pos4727"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Well why didn't (indistinct) people tocover for Mamasela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4728"><a name="pos4728"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The purpose was not to protect his identity orto cover for him, but to prevent them from leaving the countryand from receiving military training because then they would havereturned as trained terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4729"><a name="pos4729"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> ...arresting them and sending them to prisonfor a number of years, you would achieve that would you not? Many people were prosecuted, many people were sent to prison,but you choose not to take that route.   Is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4730"><a name="pos4730"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did so because I had insufficient testimonyfor a court case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4731"><a name="pos4731"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> You made no attempt to get any, did you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4762"><a name="pos4762"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mamasela had never gone to those particularcomrades, the likelihood is that those particular individualswould never on their own have made their way overseas.   The probabilityis that they would never ever on their own have made their wayoverseas for training as MK soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4763"><a name="pos4763"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> My instructions to Mamasela were never to enticeanyone, that people had to voluntarily decide to go for training.</p>

In your applicationyou make no mention of their names, their ages or anything ofthat nature and I would like to use this opportunity to tell youwho they were.   Just for the record as well I think it mightbe helpful.   Mr Chairman I should just mention there is a certainamount of confusion with regard to the people who were killedin this particular incident.   There were two incidents whichhave been investigated by the office of the Attorney-General andsome of the parents are not sure whether their children were killedin this incident or the other incident.   So we actually have11 names and not 9.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4799"><a name="pos4799"></a>Kwandabele application there's a bit of overlap.   I'll just tellyou briefly about the victims.   There was Abraham Makolane, atthe time he was 17 years old and he was a student at the J KikanaHigh School in Std 8.   He was a comrade and he had been arrestedon a few occasions and at one stage was charged with arson andpublic violence.    Then there was Samuel Masilela, he was 16years old.   He was in Form 1 at Mamelodi High School.   Accordingto his mother he was also a comrade.   Her recollection is thaton one occasion the police had come to the house looking for him.  He had never been detained or charged.   Then there was SiphoPhillip Sibanyoni, he was 15 years old.   He was also a, accordingto...(end of side 2)...he was in Std 9 at the Japhta MshlanguSchool.   His mother is unaware of any political activity by him.  He was never detained or arrested by the police.   Then therewas Thomas Phiri.   According to his sister he was 22 years oldat the time of his disappearance.   He was in Std 9, we don'thave the name of the school.   He was also an activist and a comrade,but had never been either detained or arrested.   Then there wasJeremiah Magagula.   According to his mother he was 16 years oldwhen he disappeared.   He was attending the Mthombo Primary Schoolin Mamelodi.   He was a comrade, politically active but had neverbeen arrested.   Then there was Morris Nkabinde, he was 19 yearsold when he disappeared.   He was also a comrade, although hehad never been arrested.   Then there was Matthews Promapana Lerutla.  He was 15 years old when he disappeared.   According to hismother he was also a comrade.   He had been taken by the policeon one occasion but was not charged.   Then there was StephenMakena.   </p>

<p class="line" id="line4803"><a name="pos4803"></a>was also politically active and a comrade but he had never beenarrested. Then there was Elliot Sathege, he was 20 years old.Also a comrade but never arrested and that's 10 not 11. One othername we've got here is Sibia but he, we've verified, is in factpart of the Kwandabele group.  So we have 10 names and not 9.I want to put it to you Brigadier that these young boys were typicalcomrades in the townships who got involved in the general activitiesof comrades, which generally speaking was forms of public violencein the sense of marches through the streets, boycotts, which wasthe general activity of the comrades as you know.</p>

Thesepeople were on their way to military training.   We believed thatthey would return as well-trained terrorists.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4927"><a name="pos4927"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I don't think that they would have taken therisk of putting them in a Kombi and blow them up with the possibilitythat someone might have survived and not died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4928"><a name="pos4928"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The idea that the purpose of the injectionwas to kill them never came to your mind at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4929"><a name="pos4929"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I never reflected on it, I thought that theintention was possibly to put them back in the Kombi so that theywould be unable from escaping from the Kombi while this was beingblown up.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4940"><a name="pos4940"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> My suspicion would be, or I would suspect thatthey would have died because of the injection and that they wouldthen have been blown up which would have implied that if theywere found, there would have been no remaining proof of the injectionsand that it would then have been impossible to point out anyonein that way.   The impression that we wanted to create was thatthey had blown themselves up.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4946"><a name="pos4946"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would have thought that Joe Mamasela wouldhave done this, he would not have allowed arms in the Kombi.</p>

Mamasela saidthat he would arrange for them to go to Botswana illegally sothat they would then immediately be able to receive politicalasylum and from there they could have been taken for further training.</p>

Mr Chairman theseI got from an Inquest that was held in Madiqwe, Inquest No 27/87.  Mr Chairman they are not intended for cross-examination by myself,but first to show out the question  of proportionality. (2) Toshow the relationship between the</p>

(3) To state Mr Chairman furtherthat this Inquest was held in exactly the area where the Kombiwas being blown up, that is Madiqwe.   That is all Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4969"><a name="pos4969"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> Mr Chairman may I just correct an impressionthat may have been created earlier on.   There was the discussionabout the Kombi blowing up and it was suggested...(end of side1)...as I understood it, it was suggested that there may havebeen a bomb in the Kombi but the Kombi was blown up with petrol.  In other words any vehicle can blow up if it hits a wall, ohno it wasn't sorry I misread something, my apologies.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4985"><a name="pos4985"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBE::</span> Did that have any influence on you whenyou evaluated Mr Mamasela's information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4986"><a name="pos4986"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes it would have influenced me.   I was awareof many young people going out of the country and I thought orI was convinced in my heart that I was acting in a preventativefashion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4987"><a name="pos4987"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> In that case Brigadier it wouldn't havemade any difference if Mr Mamasela had mentioned the ages of theactivists involved, you still would have proceeded with the executionof the operation?   Am I correct in concluding that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4989"><a name="pos4989"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Finally, when you received this report andwhen Mamasela assembled these young people, did nobody take itupon themselves to talk to these youngsters to find out why theywant to go overseas, is there any reason why they should not gooverseas.   You are dealing with young school children, shouldn'tanybody have talked to these young people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4990"><a name="pos4990"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chair if I would have talked to them or anyother white person, they would not have listened to us at all.  Mamasela could have talked to them, but since he was pretendingto be a terrorist and a member of MK, I think they would havethought it very peculiar if he did speak to them.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4996"><a name="pos4996"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I do not know Mr Chair, I cannot answer thisquestion but I doubt if it would have influenced them at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4997"><a name="pos4997"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Mr Mpshe, I don't know what this doctor'sexperience is, and I don't know how charred the bodies are, buthe estimates some of the ages, the last one 20 years of age, thesecond-last one 20 years of age approximately.   Then one about40 years of age, 20-25 years, 40-45 years, 30-35 years and anotherone 15 years, another one about 30 years and the first one 15-20years.   I don't know, have you got any knowledge of this doctor,have you perhaps met him before, do you know whether he's experiencedor not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4998"><a name="pos4998"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman and members of the Committee, Ihave not met the doctor, neither can I say anything to his qualifications.  As I have indicated I took this out of an Inquest that was beingheld in that area but if the Committee is of the opinion thatthe doctor should be called, I do not think we can have any difficultyin getting the doctor to explain this.   I have not met him myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4999"><a name="pos4999"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> I think the applicants could tell us whetherit's common cause that it was youngsters.   Perhaps if we couldclear that it would assist us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5000"><a name="pos5000"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman I will deal with that in re-examinationand I will make certain points when I deal with that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line5004"><a name="pos5004"></a>this a question where there should be some consultation with anexperienced pathologist as to whether the heat would affect theestimation of age.   If you are told once somebody has been burnedlike this you can't estimate age, it's an end to the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5005"><a name="pos5005"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes, Mr Chairman the point I would havewanted to make, the point is two-fold.   The first point I wantto make and perhaps I can do it now, the first point I want toplace on record is that we have had indications from Mr Currinabout the ages of these people, I would want to request Mr Currin,where he acts on behalf of these families, if he could try andobtain birth certificates.   That would be the easiest thing possibleto ascertain their ages.   I can't understand why that was notdone.   In any case probably he didn't have time so I'm not pointinga finger to him at all.   That's the first point Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5006"><a name="pos5006"></a>At this point in time, there is a lot of confusion about how oldthey really were.   The second point is if this document reallyrefers to those people, then clearly from the document itselfit contradicts what was told to the Committee about the ages.  The third point I want to make is that this document doesn'tconnect each of the people referred to by Mr Currin to the specificpeople in this document.   I don't really know what the worthof this evidence is, I'm placing that on record, I'm going toargue that Mr Chairman that worth or the value of the evidencethat I've dealt with now is really, according to the applicants,nil.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5007"><a name="pos5007"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> In the long run, when the death of the littleyoungsters is no longer in doubt there might be very little toargue about how they were killed, whether they were</p>
<p class="line" id="line5008"><a name="pos5008"></a>4b killed /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line5009"><a name="pos5009"></a>MR CURRIN 630 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line5010"><a name="pos5010"></a> killed as a result of an explosion in the Kombi and so on, thatmight be just a minor issue at the end of the day.   On the otherpoint, as to the ages of these youngsters I think that can beput beyond doubt and if Mr Currin is in a position to do so, wewill be pleased if he does take steps to obtain their birth certificatesor else call their mothers to give evidence if they are in a positionto tell us precisely when their children were born.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5011"><a name="pos5011"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> Mr Chairman I can mention to you that duringthe course of this morning I spoke to every mother and one sisterof all the names that I gave to you and the ages that I put tothe Brigadier were on the basis of what the relatives told me.  They are all in this room at the moment and if necessary theycan all be called to assist in verifying ages.   So the evidenceis right here if it's needed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5012"><a name="pos5012"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> I'm just wondering whether it isn't possibleto obtain their birth certificates because sometimes birth certificatesare a little more reliable than people's memories about when theirchildren were born.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5013"><a name="pos5013"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> Yes, I think mothers generally do know butwe are taking instructions at this very moment to see what sortof documentation we have available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5014"><a name="pos5014"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Can I make another suggestion and thatis if the Inquest report itself was received, not just the postmortem,that should contain details of where the bodies were found etc.,and may possibly make it clearer whether they were found in aKombi which had been exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5015"><a name="pos5015"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes Mr Chairman, we're simply interestedin establishing the truth and that is why I accept what Mr Currinsays and I don't for a moment really want to doubt</p>

<p class="line" id="line5018"><a name="pos5018"></a> what the people say but we all know that when documentary evidenceis available, one would like to have that and the applicants wouldlike to see the documentary evidence about the ages and theirbirth certificates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5019"><a name="pos5019"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman perhaps to inform the Committeeon this, as I have indicated this forms part of an Inquest thatwas held in Madiqwe to respond to Judge Wilson's issue.   TheInquest report was studied by myself, these charred bodies werefound in that Kombi at that place in Nietverdiend.   It is inthe Inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5020"><a name="pos5020"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5021"><a name="pos5021"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman I just want to clear thisup, can we accept that this document refers to those 10 peoplewho were in the Kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5022"><a name="pos5022"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman I would say on the basis of thepoints I have just stated when I was handing them out, it couldbe inferred that these are the people who were in the Kombi.  They were 10 in the Kombi and the postmortems are 10 as wellas Mr Chairman the abridged death certificates that don't tellus anything just to say there are also 10.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5023"><a name="pos5023"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5024"><a name="pos5024"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman then on that basis I acceptwhat my learned friend says, we don't have any real reason todispute this except that I will then argue that if there is noother evidence about the ages then this is the only evidence aboutthe people's ages before this Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5025"><a name="pos5025"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> There is other evidence about their agesand this is an opinion obviously expressed but not first-handbecause the doctor obviously expresses an opinion but it's indoubt whether he expresses an expert opinion or not in this case.</p>

You keep on saying people wouldn't give evidence against themand that excuses everything, there were many other things thatthe police could do, weren't there?   You tapped telephones, youopened mail, you frequently taped conversations didn't you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line5087"><a name="pos5087"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> "Where activists went for training eitherinside or outside the country, they would necessarily have beeneliminated to prevent that at a later stage they would be ableto destabilise the country and its people by means of acts ofterror such as bombing attacks on both the Security Forces aswell as soft targets.   As soon as an activist received training,he was in a different class from a normal activist and his knowledgeand skill were equal to that of the Security Police, he wouldthen have been able to act far more effectively in military operations."</p>

<p class="line" id="line5114"><a name="pos5114"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Brigadier, Mr Currin during the cross-examinationstated towards you that your action against these persons wasbeyond all proportion with regard to their age, which is underdispute or at least is unclear before the Committee with regardto their age, and that in view of their actions as against theirelimination that this would have been entirely beyond all proportion.  I want to ask you whether you considered the fact that theywere on their way to receive military training that they wouldhave returned to the country to wage war, under these circumstanceswould you have considered it beyond all proportion to take thisaction or would you have considered it justified?</p>

<p class="line" id="line5117"><a name="pos5117"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As I have said the wanted to leave the countryto receive military training.   If we managed to stop them thenat a later stage they would have left because out of experiencewe knew that if that person truly intended to receive militarytraining, it was not possible to stop the person.</p>

<p class="line" id="line5146"><a name="pos5146"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> So in that case Brigadier, would these activistshave left their homes voluntarily to leave abroad for three monthsor longer for training purposes?</p>

<p class="line" id="line5152"><a name="pos5152"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes they were rather inebriated at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5153"><a name="pos5153"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> So you would not have been able to have a conversationwith them to determine whether they were in fact voluntarily ontheir way or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5154"><a name="pos5154"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, but I had been driving behind them from Pretoriaand they were in a lively mood, they were laughing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5155"><a name="pos5155"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Could this be because of the beer they weredrinking?</p>

<p class="line" id="line5191"><a name="pos5191"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mamasela was in a different category, we senthim out to receive training he didn't go out to receive trainingon his own.   He was never really a member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5192"><a name="pos5192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> This word "askari" is it an Englishword, and Afrikaans word or one of the African languages?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5193"><a name="pos5193"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would imagine that the word comes from somewherein Africa.   It's a word used elsewhere in Africa for, I don'tknow if it was the British who used it, who gave them the name,but there were people known as askaris elsewhere in Africa.</p>

I do not think, however,Mr Chairman but I haven't checked it, that there will be othernames mentioned in Captain Hechter's application that were notmentioned in the other applications as all the matters where nameswere mentioned in Captain Hechter's application were dealt withby other witnesses as well.

<p class="line" id="line5233"><a name="pos5233"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Captain Hechter yesterdayyou heard the testimony of Brigadier Cronje regarding this matter.  Mr Chairman, Captain's Hechter application you will find thaton page 36.    Mr Chairman I again just want to refer you to thefact that it should be "murder" and not "attemptedmurder" on page 36.   Captain Hechter, is there any aspectin Brigadier Cronje's testimony that you disagree with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5234"><a name="pos5234"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5235"><a name="pos5235"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter, there are however a coupleof aspects which you can elaborate on.   Let's start with thefirst aspect, that is the actions of Joe Mamasela and what hewould have said to these activists and your view of Joe</p>
<p class="line" id="line5236"><a name="pos5236"></a>1. Mamasela /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line5237"><a name="pos5237"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 647 J HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line5238"><a name="pos5238"></a>Mamasela.   Could you please elaborate on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5239"><a name="pos5239"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chair, what Joe told these children I wouldof course not be able to repeat to you, but as I had already gottento know Joe Mamasela in 1986 he was a very intelligent and pleasantperson, a person for whom at that time I had tremendous respect.  He was an excellent operative and in my view his loyalty wascomplete.   There was no doubt with regard to his loyalty, hespoke of the white and the black "boers" and consideredhimself as a black boer who entirely identified with that sideof the struggle.   He never received any money for any of hisactions, he did however attempt to borrow money from me, but Idenied that because we did not work for money we were involvedin a struggle and I told him that if that was his view, he wouldhave to go.   As I have said, Mamasela is a highly intelligentand extremely well trained operative.   He is an operative bynature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5240"><a name="pos5240"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain would there, at that time, have beenany reason to doubt that which Mamasela told Brigadier Cronjewith regard to his actions towards the activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5241"><a name="pos5241"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not at all, Joe came across as an entirely honestperson at that time, honest of course in our sense or towardsus, he did his work without any oversight and the previous commandingofficers who were in charge of him, I believe in the West Rand,thought so much of him that at that time they purchased a vehiclefor him from the secret State fund.   He obtained petrol witha private card and he had complete access to the vehicle for hisprivate use.   Joe never, as far as we have been able to determine,abused this privilege.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5242"><a name="pos5242"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> He wasn't working for money but he gota</p>

<p class="line" id="line5245"><a name="pos5245"></a>free vehicle and a card for petrol, over and above his salary,is that the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5246"><a name="pos5246"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is positively the case, we all worked underthis arrangement.   We would have a State vehicle, a normal salaryand in addition a vehicle with which to operate which would thenhave been registered in his name so that it would not be possibleto trace the vehicle by means of the registration number to hisplace of employment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5247"><a name="pos5247"></a>MR DU PLESSIS (contd)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5248"><a name="pos5248"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Could I then ask you Captain, with regard tothe age of the activists, are you able to remember, you know thatMr Cronje has given testimony that persons of 18 years old didserve in the SADF and the SAP, would it have been possible thatwhite children at that time would have been able to serve at ayounger age?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5249"><a name="pos5249"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I do believe that Brigadier Cronje has made amistake, there were persons from the age of 16 who were takenup, for instance as military servicemen in the SADF, that is ofthe age of 16.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5250"><a name="pos5250"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> These would then have been persons who leftschool at about Std 8?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5251"><a name="pos5251"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5252"><a name="pos5252"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> May I just help my learned friend and puton record that we're not intending to dispute that children areand have been involved in war situations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5253"><a name="pos5253"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes Mr Chairman I realise that, I realiseMr Currin's position but I do have an obligation to place certainfacts before the Committee on which I will argue at a later stagein respect of the importance of this issue.   So it does not necessarilyconfront specifically just Mr Currin but it deals with the wholesituation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line5256"><a name="pos5256"></a>MR DU PLESSIS (contd)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5257"><a name="pos5257"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Hechter, your experience at that timeduring the unrest of persons involved in such unrest, would yoube able to give us a little more information with regard to theirages, the ages of comrades and what your experience would havebeen in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5258"><a name="pos5258"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> During the unrest I had at a certain time beeninvolved in a riot squad unit who dealt particularly with theunrest situation throughout South Africa.   At a certain stagein Atteridgeville, when I was still a very young constable, westill used the old Hippo vehicles, we came around a corner andthere were two vehicles parked next to the road.   A group ofnot youth but children, and I doubt if any of them were olderthan 14, were at that time busy pouring out petrol over thesevehicles.   My Commanding Officer at that time, a Captain, butI do not remember who he was, gave instructions to shoot on thesepeople.   I then told him "don't do that, don't do that theseare children".  We sat down and drove off.   The childrenthen dispersed rapidly when they noted us.   A block away fromthis incident, both of these vehicles were in flames.   At thattime, and this must have been in the years of 1976 and later inthe 80's, the youth were politicised and activised to such anextent that they had no regard for property or life left.   Briefly,after I was stationed with the Security Branch, I was given theinstruction or I had rather been requested by the Shoshunguwepolice station, I was the service officer at that time, to comeout.   There was a person arrested known as "Naughty"and this person had the entire Shoshunguwe area in the palm ofhis hand.   If he would say that there was a consumer boycott,then that</p>
<p class="line" id="line5259"><a name="pos5259"></a>1. consumer /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line5260"><a name="pos5260"></a>MR DU PLESSIS 650 J HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line5261"><a name="pos5261"></a>consumer boycott would have occurred.   If he gave instructionsfor a school boycott they would have occurred.  He ruled the entirearea with an iron hand.   I still don't entirely understand theentire story of activists and people like that, but then I wentthere and I visited Naughty in the cell.   On my way down thecorridor I saw a young boy and then I walked back to the Sergeantand I asked him where this person is that I have to see becausethere was only a child in the back.   The Sergeant then laughedand told me that this is indeed the person.   I walked over, Ispoke to Naughty, and I asked him if he was the terror of Shoshunguwe.  At that time he was 15 years of age and he ruled Shoshunguwewith an iron hand.   I do not know if he received his instructionsfrom older persons, from adults, but at that time I was very inexperiencedmyself.   I had an interview with him and then returned to myoffice and I was flabbergasted, I could hardly believe that aperson of such a young age could be so deeply involved in politicalactivity and could exercise such a degree of power.   I was atthat time already an adult but I had not realised that any personcould exercise this degree of power over others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5262"><a name="pos5262"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain, your recollections with regard toactivists who left for military training, in your knowledge andI am only asking about what you can remember generally speaking,would you be able to remember whether these were normally personsof an older age or a younger age?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5263"><a name="pos5263"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> These were normally youths, comrades, activistsand the like who left the country were generally younger than20.   I can remember a particular incident in Zeerust where ofthese youths at that time of the age of 14, left the country andreturned two years later, and if my memory</p>

<p class="line" id="line5266"><a name="pos5266"></a>does not fail me they then killed people in the Western Transvaaland were hunted down by the police.   Two of them were shot deadand the other three were arrested and then it became clear whattheir ages were.   We would be able to refer to this case if thatis of interest to the Committee and we would be able to tracethis case because the three of them were charged.   At the timeof their action they were 16 and they had left the country fortraining at the age of 14.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5267"><a name="pos5267"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Chairman...also in argument, there is areported decision on that.   If you will just bear with me MrChairman.   Captain Hechter would you be able to tell the Committeeunder these circumstances, or the circumstances under which Mamaselaoperated, would Mamasela have enticed these persons or would hehave acted as per the testimony of Brigadier Cronje?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5268"><a name="pos5268"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> This would be an opinion concerning somethingwhere I was not present.   I do know that Mamasela at that timewas very positive but I'm afraid that I would not really be ableto express an opinion in this regard.</p>

<p class="line" id="line5271"><a name="pos5271"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> May it please you Sir.   Captain, Naughty thatyou referred to, is that Naughty Msisi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5272"><a name="pos5272"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes, Naughty Msisi that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5273"><a name="pos5273"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Naughty Msisi was a client of mine for aboutfour years.   You very effectively detained him on many occasions,he was arrested, he was charged, he was in and out of jail, isthat correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5274"><a name="pos5274"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would assume so, one does not keep close record. I do remember that he impressed me considerably.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5275"><a name="pos5275"></a>1. QUESTION: /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line5276"><a name="pos5276"></a>MR CURRIN 652 J HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line5277"><a name="pos5277"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I may tell you, I saw him recently and he worksfor an insurance company, a very respectable young South Africanman today in the new South Africa.   That is the way in whichthe Riot Squad and the Security Police dealt with the vast majorityof the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5278"><a name="pos5278"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chair we can argue in this regard but that isthe case, the degree of or the number of deaths, the people whowere forced to eat eggs, the number of schools that were not attendedbecause of Naughty Msisi's actions, the number of people for whomhe caused tremendous unease because of the circumstances.   In1986 of course the entire situation became far more intense.  Consumer boycotts became violent, the entire country was consumedin violence.   We had then to act decisively against these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5279"><a name="pos5279"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...gave the police powers, as well as the InternalSecurity Act, which were used very, very effectively in the townshipsto deal with the situation in the townships and that is what thepolice generally did.   I put that to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5280"><a name="pos5280"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I entirely understand what you are saying butthe situation had become of such a nature that it was no longerpossible to act in this way with regard to these people.   Butthis is not in the case of every person, every second or thirdperson in the black community was an activist or a comrade andif we look in terms of percentages how many people were treatedin a rough manner these would be the extreme cases on their side.  Only those persons who went entirely beyond all control, personswho committed arson and true acts of violence, as far as we coulddetermine, these persons who were the real fermenters(?) of violenceand then the only possibility remaining for us was to counter</p>
<p class="line" id="line5281"><a name="pos5281"></a>1. violence /...</p>

<p class="line" id="line5284"><a name="pos5284"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The measures which you took in this instanceto trap nine or 10 young schoolboys into believing that they weregoing for training as then potential soldiers and to then killthem, was totally unjustifiable even in the circumstances thatprevailed.   I just want to tell you that that is what we aregoing to argue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5285"><a name="pos5285"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It is of course your right to argue in this casebut what is important for us was that there were persons of theage of 14 who left the country, who returned and who generallykilled mainly their own people, black people.   I can accept entirelythat you would argue in this way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5286"><a name="pos5286"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> To blow up the Kombi, who put that together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5287"><a name="pos5287"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> This was also done by Special Forces, I had noknowledge of it at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5288"><a name="pos5288"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> All the information that you got regardingthe victims in this instance was from Joe Mamasela and you haveno personal knowledge of what they had done?</p>

<p class="line" id="line5291"><a name="pos5291"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> There are two matters I want to ask youabout.   The first is, we have been told that Mamasela was drivinga Kombi that these people were travelling in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5292"><a name="pos5292"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5293"><a name="pos5293"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Where did the Kombi come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5294"><a name="pos5294"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chair as far as I can remember, BrigadierCronje gave testimony that he made this Kombi available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5295"><a name="pos5295"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Was it one of your Kombis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5296"><a name="pos5296"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It wasn't one which we normally used in the Branch,I cannot exactly remember or know where Brigadier</p>

<p class="line" id="line5299"><a name="pos5299"></a>Cronje would have obtained it, but it was not one we generallyused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5300"><a name="pos5300"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> As I understand it, no attempt was madeto remove the chassis No., the engine No., or anything of thatnature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5301"><a name="pos5301"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would not be able to give testimony in thisregard because I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5302"><a name="pos5302"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> While you were there it wasn't done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5303"><a name="pos5303"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not in my presence no, it wasn't done in mypresence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5304"><a name="pos5304"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> The second point is you've told us thatMamasela was given a motor vehicle, paid out of secret State funds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5305"><a name="pos5305"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is the case Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5306"><a name="pos5306"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Were you given a vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5307"><a name="pos5307"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes but it wasn't paid out of the secret fund. This was a vehicle which had to be referred back to the State,it could be traced.   It was only an official vehicle which Iused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5308"><a name="pos5308"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Do you know of any other things that wereprovided or bought with secret State funds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5309"><a name="pos5309"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No Chair, there were vehicles which were givento some of the police out of the secret funds, this was indeedthe case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5310"><a name="pos5310"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Some of the police in your Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5311"><a name="pos5311"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No not in our Branch, these would have been peoplewho worked under deep cover.   Their vehicle would had to havebeen registered in their names so that if anyone traced the registrationnumber they would not be able to trace it back to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5312"><a name="pos5312"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> ...I have is why it should have to comefrom</p>

<p class="line" id="line5316"><a name="pos5316"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I will not be able to help you in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5317"><a name="pos5317"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Mamasela was paid a salary wasn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5318"><a name="pos5318"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was indeed paid a salary, a full police salary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5319"><a name="pos5319"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> ...do you know that he had been a criminal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5320"><a name="pos5320"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did not know sir, I only discovered this inlater years.   He only told me how well trained a terrorist hewas, we co-operated for three years, we worked very closely togetherand he only told me how very well trained he was.   He was veryproud of the way in which he acted, but he never told me thathe was a criminal previously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5321"><a name="pos5321"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> He told you how well trained a terroristhe was, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5322"><a name="pos5322"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He told me that he was sent out for trainingand that he was very well trained with regard to his knowledgeof East Block arms.   At that time I was brand new at the SecurityBranch and his knowledge of the AK and the Makarov and the handgrenadesand all of these arms were indeed very excellent.</p>

<p class="line" id="line5328"><a name="pos5328"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At that time he was a Sergeant.</p>

<p class="line" id="line5333"><a name="pos5333"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I don't think so, I think everyone who left thecountry, left voluntarily they grasped the opportunity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5334"><a name="pos5334"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> No, were there activists who did not go fortraining?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5335"><a name="pos5335"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Indeed, many of them did not leave for militarytraining they continued with the struggle here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5336"><a name="pos5336"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...instructions from Brigadier Cronje thatthe Kombi that was used was what they called an "Article3 Kombi", it was as I understand it, and there was evidenceto that effect, a stolen Kombi which was returned and was utilisedby the police in terms of normal legislation.   That was the Kombithat was used.   Those are my instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5337"><a name="pos5337"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> So it would have been easy to identifythat it was a vehicle that was being used by the police, if itwas done officially, if it was handed over to them officially,or are they saying they got stolen property handed over to themwith no record kept?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5338"><a name="pos5338"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman my instructions are that itwouldn't have been easy to link it to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5339"><a name="pos5339"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> One wonders why, stolen property, presumablyhe police keep a record of in case the owner arrives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5340"><a name="pos5340"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman, my information and my instructionsare that these were stolen vehicles which were not claimed bythe owners, which were taken back by the police, they weren'tclaimed by their owners and they were never registered on thename of the South African Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5341"><a name="pos5341"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> But a record should be available of stolengoods that come into the hands of the police surely?</p>

<p class="line" id="line5347"><a name="pos5347"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Captain Hechter you wouldn't be able tounequivocally state that some of the activists who left the countryfor training were not persuaded by some of the MK people who werein the country or ANC officials?</p>

<p class="line" id="line5410"><a name="pos5410"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> According to the office of the Attorney-Generalit's going to be a matter of assumption and evidence at the trial.   They have gone to great pains to try and establish the identityof the children who were in that bus at the time and the listof names that we were given is really that which they seem tohave put together on what they've got.   If we were to try andprove it, I think we'd have to call evidence from the office ofthe Attorney-General.</p>

<p class="line" id="line5417"><a name="pos5417"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5418"><a name="pos5418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> If any one of the parents did see that andcan give that evidence about the time of the departure, how manyof them were there, whether she recognised any others apart fromher own particular son and matters of that kind should be canvassed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5419"><a name="pos5419"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> Yes, we have some of that information.   Someof the parents are not sure of the exact date and also when childrenwere taken away, when children left for Kwandabele in some instancesa white Kombi was also used, in fact in many instances a whiteKombi was used, so that doesn't necessarily determine which incidentthey were involved in, but what we can do is go through what we'vegot if we could have a short adjournment and also have furtherdiscussions with the office of the Attorney-General and try andpresent a summary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5420"><a name="pos5420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes, we would like a fuller picture of thecircumstances leading up to the departure of these people.

<p class="line" id="line5422"><a name="pos5422"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Well you don't have to lead all the parents,if there is one parent who can give that evidence?</p>

<p class="line" id="line5426"><a name="pos5426"></a>and facilitate the proceedings and go this route.   You are quitecorrect, as a result of that change of strategy that evidenceisn't on record.   What we can do is now try and, if we couldhave a 10 minute adjournment, I'm sure we could get it all togetherand get one parent to present that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5427"><a name="pos5427"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBE::</span> Before we do that, Mr Du Plessis are yousaying that there is some dispute about whether or not Mr Currin'sclients would have been the correct victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5428"><a name="pos5428"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman, as I have pointed out atthe beginning of these hearings, we are not sure about the interpretationof the Act pertaining to evidence given in this forum in respectof possible later proceedings.   I cannot therefore make admissionsor accept certain facts which might become very important laterand which might not be excluded from a future criminal trial andit is on that basis that I want to place that on record.   Forpurposes of these hearings the importance pertains to the questionof the ages of the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5429"><a name="pos5429"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBE::</span> If, for the purpose of these proceedings,you are not willing to admit that these are the victims and ifthat becomes an issue, I hope you are aware of the profound impactand influence this is going to have on these proceedings.   Oneof the problems is that you would be asking, or your clients wouldbe asking for amnesty in respect of the people that you don'tadmit have been the people placed before us and it could alsohave an impact on whether or not we have given notice in termsof the Act to the correct people.   That, in turn, brings intoquestion as to whether or not procedural requirements have beencomplied with.</p>

<p class="line" id="line5434"><a name="pos5434"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Well Mr Chairman obviously in the lightof what was raised now, it might be possible that some of thesepeople are not the people involved.   The point...</p>
<p class="line" id="line5435"><a name="pos5435"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> All of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5436"><a name="pos5436"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Or perhaps all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5437"><a name="pos5437"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Maybe we have given the notice to the wrongpeople altogether?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5438"><a name="pos5438"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman I have pointed out this aswell, and that is that the obligation in respect of Section 19does not rest on the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5439"><a name="pos5439"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> But you can't eat your cake and still haveit.   You must decide whether you are accepting that these arethe victims or possibly these could be the victims and then weproceed with the matter on that basis.   If you don't, then youmust concede that possibly we have given the notice to the wrongpeople.   You can't have it both ways.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5440"><a name="pos5440"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman I've raised this point previouslyand the compliance with Section 19(4), as I understand it, cannotstand in the way of a decision in terms of Section 20.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5441"><a name="pos5441"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Well you can't commence the hearing withoutcomplying with it, don't jump the first step and go to the lastone.</p>

<p class="line" id="line5444"><a name="pos5444"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes that might be so Mr Chairman, butthis was not raised at the beginning of the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5445"><a name="pos5445"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Well you seem to be raising it now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5446"><a name="pos5446"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, nobody hastold us how the victims were identified.   Nobody has come tous and has said to us on what basis these victims were identified,it only became clear throughout the proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5447"><a name="pos5447"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> But Mr Du Plessis you have applied for amnestywith regard to person "X", we cannot give amnesty withregard to a certain person if it is not the person for whom itwas applied.   We cannot give you amnesty with regard to a certainperson if we do not know if those persons were activists, whothey were or generally there are 10 persons who died, we cannotidentify them.   How can we, with enough certainty as requiredby the Act, determine that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5448"><a name="pos5448"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> ...in respect of the murder of the 10 peoplewho occupied this Kombi whose bodies were found in it and on whominquests were held, they are specific people but you cannot identifythem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5449"><a name="pos5449"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes, yes we cannot identify them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5450"><a name="pos5450"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> You cannot put names to them but you canidentify the people in respect of whom you are asking for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5451"><a name="pos5451"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes.   Mr Chairman if this is a problemthen I can foresee various difficult problems for people in theposition of the applicants.   If, for instance, they ask amnestyonly pertaining to these 10 and the Attorney-General for somereason or another, after the cut-off date of the amnesty period,determines and finds that two of these people were wrongly identifiedand there were another two</p>
<p class="line" id="line5452"><a name="pos5452"></a>8.1b people /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line5453"><a name="pos5453"></a>MR CURRIN 666 M MAKOLANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line5454"><a name="pos5454"></a>people, then the applicants would have been prejudiced and theycannot ask amnesty in respect of those other two that have beenidentified.   So that is why the applicants say Mr Chairman theonly obligation on the applicants is to apply for amnesty in respectof that which they know, and as I understand criminal law, theycould have been prosecuted for murder and other acts, but let'stake murder, specifically pertaining to the people who were inthe Kombi and in respect of which an inquest has been held.  That is how I understand it Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5455"><a name="pos5455"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> But if the admission is made for the purposeof these proceedings and the proceedings come to a close, I don'tsee the sort of problem that you seem to be foreseeing with regardas to whether or not wrong people were, amnesty was granted inrespect of certain people.   Those admissions would have beenmade for the purpose of the proceedings and these proceedingswould have been closed.   I have profound difficulties with anysuggestion, with any argument that you could in the one breathargue that well I'm not prepared to accept that these are thevictims but in the same breath, want us to tell ourselves thatwe have given the notice to the correct people.   I can't reconcilethese two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5456"><a name="pos5456"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman with the utmost respect, Idon't know what is expected of the applicants in this regard.  Clearly I cannot be requested to make an admission of somethingthat we are not sure of and that we don't have evidence aboutand bind my clients in a different forum later in respect of suchan admission.   The only possibility that I can see is that onecan go from the viewpoint that for purposes of these proceedingsand for purposes of amnesty, reserving all the rights of the</p>

<p class="line" id="line5459"><a name="pos5459"></a>applicants and without waiving any rights whatsoever, that itis accepted that she represents the victims as far as these proceedingsgo.   I am even hesitant to make that admission Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5460"><a name="pos5460"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> There are many possibilities.   One ofthe possibilities is that if that becomes an issue there shouldbe further investigation of the matter to determine whether thesewere the correct victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5461"><a name="pos5461"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Yes, Mr Chairman as I understand the proceedingsit is possible, as I understand it, after a hearing to do that.  If I understand it correctly it might be possible to do thatin the best way possible.   The problem that you've raised howeveris let's say for argument's sake, that it is totally impossibleto make any further link whatsoever between the deceased and theapplicants, surely Mr Chairman that cannot stand in the way ofthe applicants' amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5462"><a name="pos5462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Very well, we may have to apply our minds tothis as a substantive issue at some stage.   I think that forthe present I would like this matter to be taken as far as itcan, purely evidentially so let Mr Currin be afforded the opportunityof placing before us the maximum information he's in a positionto do and maybe we might see some light at the end of the tunnelafter that.   Mr Currin you asked for a short adjournment?</p>

<p class="line" id="line5469"><a name="pos5469"></a>that Kombi in Nietverdiend on that particular day.   It transpiresthat although we are able to say with a fair amount of certaintythat at least nine of the 10 names we submitted, disappeared fromhome on 26 June, we are unable to say with certainty that allof them were in the Kombi on 27 June because in fact there seemsto be a connection between this group and the Kwandabele 9.  It would seem that at least two of the names who disappeared onthe 26th were probably part of the Kwandabele 9 and were killedin Kwandabele and not in this vehicle.   We've had discussionsamongst ourselves, the various legal representatives as well asthe office of the Attorney-General, and it seems that with a fairamount of work during the course of the next month clarificationshould be forthcoming by the end of November.   So we are unableat this stage to say categorically who was in the Kombi on 27June, 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5470"><a name="pos5470"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> What do you propose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5471"><a name="pos5471"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURRIN::</span> It would seem that it is important to tryand establish, at least on the balance of probabilities, who wasin the Kombi on that particular night and we would propose thatthe matter stand down pending further investigation by the Attorney-General'sinvestigators.   They are at this moment in time busy trying toclarify the issue and come up with a degree of certainty as towhich were the individuals that were killed in Kwandabele andwhich are the individuals who were killed in Nietverdiend.

<p class="line" id="line5477"><a name="pos5477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman I do not want to reopen what wasdone before the adjournment Mr Chairman, but I've got a bit ofdifficulty in Mr Du Plessis' submission.   During the break Ihad the opportunity of asking him what the effect of the exactidentity of the deceased would have on his application and ifI remember well, his response was that their main concern is theage of the people who died in the Kombi in that if the age isnot fully determined it may have adverse effects on the application.  I want him to confirm that before I continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5478"><a name="pos5478"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> He has made that point in another way, I understandthat.   The question now is in order to identify the personalities,not of the age so much but as far as the identity of the individualsinvolved, there seems to be no clarity in that.    Judge Ngcobealso felt concerned at this stage whether we have informed theright people, the right relatives, if we haven't satisfied ourselvesas to who the victims were.   In that regard is there anythingyou wish to say?</p>

I'm a bit worried by the...</p>
<p class="line" id="line5485"><a name="pos5485"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS::</span> Mr Chairman perhaps I can just make ourview clear.   Our view is that, and I have stated that beforethis Committee publicly, our view is that it is of importanceto determine the ages of these people.   It is also importantfor purposes of the Committee when giving amnesty, if the Committeeshould decide to give amnesty, that amnesty should be given inrespect of the death of certain individuals as far as that canbe ascertained.   We do not have a problem with that.   If theenquiry should place beyond doubt who the people in the Kombiwere, we don't have a problem because then we can be granted amnestyin respect of that.   If the result is that the people cannotbe identified, we will apply for amnesty in respect of the deathof the unknown person who were in the Kombi.   We say that thereshould be no reason whatsoever to preclude any further investigationsto find out the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5486"><a name="pos5486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Whatever the position, it seems that it cannotbe resolved at this stage Mr Mpshe, and we are then obliged toadjourn this hearing to another day.

We wouldobviously not want a situation to arise when we recommence inFebruary where people who have been implicated haven't been dulynotified in advance, and what we would just like to know is, isit our responsibility as representatives of the victims, to takethe initiative by approaching the Committee in regard to peoplehigher up who we would like to be here in the context of the questionof instructions and acting with authority, or is that somethingthat the Committee will automatically do in relation to thosewho have been implicated?   What are our responsibilities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5499"><a name="pos5499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Mr Currin, your responsibilities are to bringforth before this Committee all evidence which you consider tobe of relevance to this application and if there are witnessesthat you propose calling then you must do so.</p>

<p class="line" id="line5501"><a name="pos5501"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> I place no restraint on your in that regard. In the meanwhile people whose names have been mentioned duringthe course of these proceedings and who have not received noticeor who have not received adequate notice about that fact, I'veno doubt steps are already afoot to put that right.   PerhapsMr Mpshe will seek assistance to see that that is done timeously.</p>

<p class="line" id="line5508"><a name="pos5508"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Could I add to that, Mr Currin if you aregoing to call witnesses whom you know are going to name persons,it would be appreciated if you could inform Mr Mpshe timeouslyso he can then take the necessary steps to notify those peoplethat they are going to be named because he obviously cannot anticipatewhat your witnesses are going to say.   If you know that namesare going to be mentioned, if you inform Mr Mpshe he will takethe necessary steps.</p>
