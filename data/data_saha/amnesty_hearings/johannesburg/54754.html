<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I must once again apologise to the members of the public and others for the fact that this hearing did not commence at nine o'clock as it was supposed to.  The initial cause of the delay was once again the late arrival of the applicants, through no fault of their own.   What was the cause of the delay thereafter I do not know.  But I am sorry for the members of the public who have had to sit here waiting.  Mr Black?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLACK:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, the first matter which I wish to mention, is the matter which was set down for hearing for tomorrow, but after various discussions with all parties involved, we have agreed that the matter be removed from the roll.  There are two applications in effect.  It is the application of J Wheeler, application number 2084/96 and the application of Mr C Pyper, application number 5179/97.  JUDGE WILSON:  As I understand it, the reason for the removal is due to the delay in an amendment to the Act and not to any fault of the parties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLACK:</span> That is so, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Very well, the matter is removed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLACK:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The matter is removed from the roll.  I trust all the parties have been notified and they will not - including the prison authorities, so no one will be put to any inconvenience tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLACK:</span> I haven't got hold of the prison authorities yet, but the legal representatives of the parties and the victims have all been notified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The applicant may not object to being taken on a drive round Johannesburg, so if you don't get in touch with him it won't really cause him any great prejudice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Black, the reason is that the cut-off date hasn't been extended yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLACK:</span> That is so.  That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> (Microphone not switched on) ... the Constitution and the Act has got to be amended and we are almost nearing the 10th of May so this should be done as an urgent matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLACK:</span> I have spoken to the Constitutional Development Department.  I am told that they are in the process of preparing a proposal for an amendment to the Constitution, and that amendment was - the proposal must still be approved of by the Minister and the Cabinet and thereafter debated in Parliament.</p>
