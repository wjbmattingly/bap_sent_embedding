He wanted to know where I was - what I was doing in Johannesburg because I was unable to contact him over the weekend and I indicated that we had a problem with this hearing and that there was a likelihood that we wouldn't proceed if there was a request for an adjournment given the developments this morning and he indicated that I should place on record, or inform the Chair of the considerable cost to the Commission at this delicate stage in the process where we can hardly waste funds.  I understand from the logistics officer that just today we have wasted costs in the order of about R7 to R8000.  In addition thereto both victims are present - Mrs Erasmus and Klukas who are extremely upset at the developments today.  They came here expecting to hear the further evidence and possibly the conclusion of the application.\n\tBut further than that I have no other comment.",

And I accordingly feel that it would be grossly unfair to them for us to order them to continue and that the matter will then have to be adjourned.\n\tI can see no prospects of them getting a lawyer to go through these papers within the next few days.  It will have to be adjourned to a date to be arranged.  Do you agree?",

It may well be that once the legal advisors are in the position that they can give an explanation that will not embarrass their clients the whole thing falls away, because I can understand that it puts them in an invidious position if they have some information which would grossly prejudice their client but which has obliged them to act as they did.  They certainly could not tell the present Committee about it.  But I think that it is a matter that should be enquired into.\n\tI will then adjourn the matter to a date to be arranged.\nMICROPHONES NOT WORKING",
