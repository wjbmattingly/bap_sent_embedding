I trust that that has been done.\n\tIn the meantime I understand that two of the mentioned victims have appointed counsel to attend to their interests in the matter and I understand also that the Inkatha Freedom Party has engaged him to look after their interest as well.\n\tI want to point out that the Inkatha Freedom Party is entitled to have done what they did to look after their political interests.  Membership of any particular political party does not as a matter of course, lead to the interest of individuals being covered.  It remains for the individual to do what is necessary and give necessary instructions if that person so desires to get representation and give instructions for his or her interests to be attended to.\n\tMr Xaba, you will have noticed that Mr Swanepoel is now in attendance at this hearing.  You mentioned Mr Msizi during your testimony when we last sat.  I'm going to ask you a few questions in order to put him in a position to equate himself with the material issues of your testimony, do you understand that?",
