<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> I thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Thank you Honourable Chair. May I beg leave to call as a witness on behalf of the objectors, Mr Jimmy Stephens.  I have prepared a bundle of - that contains the statements of the witnesses which we intend leading on behalf of the objectors and some other documents which we would like to refer to for purposes of argument.  May I beg leave to hand this up to the honourable Committee.  It has got an index and it's paginated for purposes of reference Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I would think so Mr Chair.  Unfortunately I don't know where we've come to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Provisionally we'll mark this as Exhibit E.  I'm advised that this will be E, but if it transpires that we will have to change it then we will do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> As the Committee pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Chair may I just indicate before we commence with this witness, the witness has indicated to me that he is employed with a specific business concern, he does not wish the specific concern's identity to be disclosed for obvious reasons.  May I beg leave for that not to be disclosed for record purposes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) unless something material turns on it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I don't believe so.  I have canvassed that with the representatives for the applicants, there doesn't seem to be any difficulty with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> (Duly sworn in, states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Chair, I would just like to indicate to the witness that the microphone in front of you, Mr Stephens, should be activated by yourself.  If you speak, just press the red button.  Once you've finished, just press the grey button for it to be switched off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>	Mr Stephens, on the 28th of March 1994 you were the Manager of a business concern situated at the corners of King George and Plein Streets, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Your business was actually situated right at the corner of those two streets, and the windows had a view overlooking King George Street in a northerly direction, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> What time did you arrive at work that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> It must have been about 08H00, roundabout there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Just for purposes of background, prior to that day, had you ever seen marches of Zulu people gathering in and around the centre of Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> How many times had you experienced it before that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well I'm not exactly sure, but marches used to happen on a continuous basis in the Johannesburg area, but IFP marches, I can't recall exactly how many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can you please relate to the Committee what you saw on the day of the 28th of March 1994?  Can we take it from the time you started, and I would just like you to refer with specific reference to the marchers that you saw, what were your experiences that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay, there were previous marches in the morning.  There was - I remember one specific one which was a fairly small march, where they actually walked down Plein Street in a easterly direction past the Shell House entrance.  There was a small group of Inkatha marchers, they were escorted by Police.  There were ANC - well I take it that they were ANC people because they had guns, they were waving them at the marchers that walked past.  There was one ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can I just interrupt you there.  Then you say you take it that they were ANC people, what brought you under that impression?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Because earlier on they were all gathered outside the ANC - outside Shell House entrance, and they were chatting with one another.  When the Inkatha marchers came past, they walked up to the side of the road to where they were - almost like approached them, and anyway, they were waving their arms around as well as the one or two guys that waved hand-pistols.  And then the one - there was one biggish Inkatha guy, he looked like he was a steward or one of the guys that kept them in control or so, he actually pointed to the Policemen, saying to them that there were guys, that obviously were antagonising them - well it looked that way, it was from a distance, but he pointed it out to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> And this big gentleman you're referring to, was he amongst a specific group in particular?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well he was part of the Inkatha march.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> And after that had been pointed out to the Police, what transpired then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well nothing much, the guys moved back a little bit and the march just continued on peacefully with no other incidents happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can we just get the direction in which that marchers were moving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> The march went along Plein Street from a westerly to an easterly direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> At what time did this approximately take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> It could have been between 09H00 and 10H00, somewhere around there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> So these marchers passed in your field of view from, as you're standing in your business, from your left to your right.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's correct, ja.  Within - it's about 20/30 metres, it's right in front of the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes, what happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well then they marched off.  During the day there was - well during the rest of the time before the main march there were Inkatha guys walking around with their weapons, one or two - mostly one at a time, and they were all walking up towards Noord Street in that direction, and some were going towards the ...(indistinct), so I'm not sure if they knew exactly where to meet, but they were all moving up in a northerly direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You say they had their weapons, what do you mean with "they had their weapons"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Knobkierries and sticks, that's the main thing that I saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Did you see any firearms amongst these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No not myself personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes you may continue, what happened after that?  MR STEPHENS:   Well then - I think it before 12 some time, I'm not sure exactly of the time, - well it was probably about 11, somewhere around there that I actually saw all these guards that were previously part of the Shell House incident.  They were just gathering outside the entrance itself.  And then afterwards I saw the - when the crowd really started building up at Noord Street there, then I saw this one ANC guard come out with a - which I thought was an AK47, sit next to a pillar and he kneeled down, and he was aiming towards them and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can we just take it slowly Mr Stephens.  Where did this gentleman come from, where did you see him for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well I was looking at the marchers itself, and I just happened to look over towards the ANC headquarters at the entrance of Shell House, and I saw the guy coming down with the rifle - well say in the last 5 or 10 metres I just saw him come with the rifle, and then he ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> And where did he position himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> It was - there's two pillars on the side - on the easterly side of King George Street, on the corner of Plein, and he just - first of all he stood there, and when the marchers ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Sorry, is that the corners of King George and Plein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> On the easterly side of the King George Street of the intersection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's right, on the Shell House side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Next to the Shell House pillars, so to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's correct.  And anyway, then he knelt down as if he was gonna shoot at them ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Okay, can we just concentrate on the marchers that you saw at that point in time, where were they at that point in time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I think they were between Noord and De Villiers - approaching De Villiers Street, in the King George Street itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> From a northerly to a southerly direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Coming in a southerly direction, that's correct.  And then - well anyway, as they came up to De Villiers in King George Street, they slowly moved over De Villiers towards - well still in King George, coming towards - in a southerly direction towards Plein Street, that's when this guard ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can I just interrupt you at this point in time again.  What exactly did - was the crowd doing at that stage?  What motions - if you compare it to your normal experience of Zulu marches, how would you compare the actions of the crowd as opposed to normal marches at point in time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well they were jumping up and down and there was a - you could hear this "woe-woe" noise, obviously chanting, and that was about all that I could see from that distance anyway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Did anything other than - anything other happen than what would happen in a normal march?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> At that time it didn't look any different to any other march, to me anyway, except it was a bigger than previous other marches that I'd seen.  That was the only difference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Previously that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Previously that morning, and on other occasions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> If you would be kind enough to describe the way in which the crowd was moving forward, were they running forward, were they walking forward, what did they do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I'd say more moving forward, it's almost when they sort of half run on the spot, but sort of move forward at the same time.  But not fast, it was a slow movement forward, almost like a walking pace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes, and what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well as they sort of crossed De Villiers Street, this ANC security guard opened up fire.  That's all I saw, and I never heard any previous shots, I just saw him shoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Is that the gentleman you were referring to that you earlier saw with the - what you believed to be an AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's right, it was the same guy that was kneeling down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> If you say he opened fire, do you know the difference between automatic fire and single-shot fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes, I do.  It was automatic fire, short bursts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> What was the crowd's reaction to this fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Oh, they just dispersed with quite a few guys trying to hide behind - there was a vehicle in King George Street, on the corner - well on the corner of De Villiers, but in the southerly side of De Villiers in King George, and they were all trying to hide behind this car.  Other guys just ran down De Villiers in all directions, and up Noord as well.  They just dispersed within a couple of seconds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> How far had the marchers progressed into the block between De Villiers and Plein Street in King George Street by the time the shooting started?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> They'd basically just entered it, and then the shooting started and then whatever guys could probably ran in 5 to 10 metres inside - you know, looking for cover, and the rest of the guys ran down the side of De Villiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) again, all ran for cover, the people that were being shot at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ja, the people who were being shot at by this guard, or the guard that I could see shooting.  They ran for cover, there were cars in front.  In other words if this is De Villiers and if this is King George - as they came into King George just crossing De Villiers Road, there was a car parked over here which was about 5 metres, maybe 10 metres inside in King George, they ran to duck behind - because the firing was coming from that direction, and the other people ran down De Villiers.  So it was basically as they crossed De Villiers that the security guard opened up fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You mentioned the gentleman shooting in short bursts of automatic fire.  At the time when the marchers started dispersing, was there still some fire emanating from the firearm of this guard you saw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Sorry, just say that again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> At the time when the marchers started dispersing, when they started running away, was the security guard with the rifle you saw firing on automatic firing, was he still continuing or had his fire stopped at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> He was still shooting an automatic in short bursts.  The people had basically - well most of them had -there was a big gap, and everybody else was hiding behind the car, and he was still shooting on automatic at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes, you may continue Mr Stephens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well then what happened was - well I also saw by that stage there was quite a few other guards standing around the guard himself with this Policeman that was standing next to him as well, and by then most of the people had dispersed and there was only people behind the car trying to hide away, and what happened was, he re-loaded and he was busy shooting on single-fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Are you referring to the same gentleman that was using the automatic fire earlier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's correct.  Because he actually stopped, and I actually ran out the shop and then I actually - because I was trying to get the attention of the Policemen to tell them to stop shooting, because you know, there was basically people who were just like trying to take cover, and that's when another gentleman came across in a green - it looked like a safari-suite, but ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Sorry, could you just repeat that, when another gentleman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ja, he ran across the road shooting with a 9mm, and that's when I ran back inside, and I actually saw him standing around the side because he - obviously he couldn't shoot them properly from the angle that he was at, he tried to get a better angle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can we just try and position this second gentleman you're talking about?  What firearm did he have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well it was a handgun, it could have been a 9mm, I'm not sure, but it was a handgun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> From which direction did he come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> He came from an easterly direction, he ran in a westerly direction down Plein Street, and he was looking straight on King George down the walkway, the pathway, so he could get a better angle at the people that were being shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Was he positioned on one of the two pavements of King George Street, so to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes he was, he was positioned on the westerly side of King George Street.  He was there only for a second or two.  As soon as he had shot his loads, he had run back.  By that stage I was back inside the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> So he was positioned on the westerly pavement of King George Street, he was shooting in a northerly direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> And can you just repeat, I'm not sure I understood you correctly, he actually crossed King George Street from the easterly to the westerly side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Why did he do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> To get a better shot, or a better angle at the Inkatha marchers that were all trying to hide behind the vehicle.  Because obviously from the easterly side of corner Plein and King George, his view was obstructed by the car that they were trying to hide behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> And can you give an indication of the number of shots this gentleman fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No, there was quite a few, but I couldn't tell you how many.  More than five or six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> When was the last time you observed the gentleman with the automatic rifle firing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well he was the last person to stop firing.  I can't exactly say when the last time I saw him.  When he was picking up his bullets and then he went back into the ANC building, that's the last time I saw him.  Picking up bullets, picking up the cartridges that the empty, empty cartridges, and there was somebody else helping him pick them up as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> By that time the fire from the gentleman with the handgun had ceased, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes.  Like I said, the guy with the AK or the assault rifle, he was the last guy to shoot, that I noticed shooting anyway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Did you look at where these people went to after the shooting ceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well they basically all went back towards the entrance of Shell House, and some of them actually stayed around there as well.  I can't say how many went inside and how many stayed behind, but they were in that vicinity.  But the guy with the - the security guard that had the rifle, I saw him go back inside Shell House.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Did you actually see him entering the building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No, I can't say I did, but he went in that direction, and that's the last I saw of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Stephens, as far as the positioning of the crowd is concerned after the shooting, what happened to the injured and the dead people, where were they positioned with relation to the block of King George Street between Plein and De Villiers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well the people I saw were all on the westerly direction on the corner of De Villiers and King George, basically were all behind that one car.  That's the only injured people I really saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> If witnesses before this Committee were to say that, and specifically ANC guards, were to say that they believed at the time when the shooting commenced that there was an attack on either the life or the property of Shell House, what would your comment be to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Not a chance, noways.  Because the entrance of Shell House is on the southern side of Plein Street, and they were a good 50/60 metres away, and on the wrong side of the road as well, it was around the corner.  So I would not say - I'd say that would be totally untrue.  I actually phoned the Citizen the next day because what they had reported in the papers, I - but then the journalist phoned me back and she said that she would come see me the next day, but then the next day she didn't come so I phoned them up and they said no, that she had suddenly taken leave, so that was the last of it.  Because I actually - I couldn't believe what I actually read in the papers, because I was there, I actually saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Stephens, did you see any firearms at the time of the security guard shooting on automatic fire, did you see at that stage any firearms amongst the marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Unfortunately the marchers were too far away from me, they were on the other side of De Villiers Street, so I couldn't see from there.  So whether they did have or didn't, I can't say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> At the time when the shooting commenced, or throughout the time when the shooting was in progress, did you take cognisance of - or was there, do you know, was there any shots fired from your direction in the immediate vicinity of Nando's in the direction of the crowd?  I'm talking on the business - your business side of the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> ...(indistinct) ja.  I never heard any shots except for that ANC security guard who had the assault rifle.  That was the only shot that I heard from that side, or any shot at that stage.  If there were any shots from the northern side, I never heard them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I've got no further questions, thank you Mr Chair.  	Mr Stephens, just one question, before the guard with the AK47 fired a shot, that is now from the corner at King George and Plein Street, did you hear any other shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Thank you Mr Stephens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Good morning Mr Stephens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Good morning Mr Berger, how are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm very well thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Good to hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Stephens, according to your evidence at the inquest and according to your evidence today, and according to the statement that you made, there was absolutely no reason for the guards to have shot, and in your view this was, to use your words "cold-blooded murder", is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's correct.  From the position that I was in, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you were in a very good position to observe exactly what was going on that day, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I was in a good position to see what the guard did, but besides that I probably was not in the best position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, you were in your shop from 08H00 that morning until after the shooting incident occurred, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were conducting business at your shop that morning, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There wasn't much business because the streets were relatively deserted in that area of time, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You observed groups of marchers moving past and you've already told the Committee what happened with one group of marchers that you saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That was the only group - the only marchers that I saw, the rest were just individuals moving up towards their destination that they had to go to.  It was only one march that I actually saw some of the marchers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw any marchers in front of Shell House performing mock attacks on the guards stationed at the entrance to Shell House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> If there was, I think it would have been individuals, because I didn't see a big group of people as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see a smaller group of marchers, not as big as the group that was coming down King George, engaged in mock attacks on the guards at the entrance to Shell House in Plein Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I can't say I do recall, unfortunately not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I can't remember that to be specifically, but what I did see outside the shop was one or two - that's why I said individuals.  There were one or two guys with knobkierries and that, and there were some - just walkers-by, and they would you know, sort of half go for them and then just carry on - say something to them and then carry on.  That's why I say it could have happened, because I did see that, but on the Shell House, at the entrance itself, I can't recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Marchers would "half go" for whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Just basically people walking in the street, whether they were ANC or not I'm not sure - making mock attacks at them. ...(tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>	Okay, say for example he's standing over here and he's walking this way and I'm walking that way I'd go like that with a knobkierrie and carry on, and maybe say something to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So you are saying ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Mock attacks, that's correct.  But on an individual basis that I saw, it might be one or two people in groups, and I saw that maybe two occasions, maybe three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm talking about mock attacks on the guards stationed at the entrance to Shell House in Plein Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I know that's why I said, there unfortunately I can't say.  I can't say it did or it did not happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I never saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also never heard any shots being fired before the ANC guard opened fire with an AK47, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We know that shots were fired earlier that morning, shortly before this incident from marchers who were in a westerly direction down Plein Street, towards Wanderers Street, you never heard that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I never did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We know that a shot was fired in the immediate vicinity of your shop shortly before the main shooting incident, you never heard that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Unfortunately you do, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I said unfortunately you do know it, but I don't, because I never heard it unfortunately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> With the greatest respect Mr Chair, I think my learned friend Mr Berger is perhaps in this regard relying on the ballistic evidence.  It was merely one of the possibilities that somebody was firing from the southerly direction of Plein Street in a northerly direction up King George Street, it hasn't been established as a fact on my interpretation of the evidence.  It was put as mere congexture of a possibility that might have existed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) your question on the basis there was a possibility this didn't happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, the evidence that I'm referring to was that the ANC witnesses said that there was a SADF person who fired a shot, that was the - the Police said that there was an ANC person who fired a shot.  So it was disputed as to who actually fired the shot, but the fact that the shot was fired, as I understand the evidence, was not disputed.  Perhaps Mr Dorfling could comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I don't think that's being disputed.  I was talking of the direction from the Plein Street side in a northerly direction, into King George.  That's what I thought my learned friend was aiming at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, that's not what I was saying at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> You said the shot was on Wanderers side, hey, in Plein Street, is that the shot you're talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, there are two incidents that I'm referring to, there was two or three shots fired ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Two or three, not one round?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, no, hang on a second - from a westerly direction, from the Plein Street side, two or three shots were fired.  You never heard that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Unfortunately not, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That's Wanderers ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I know where that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Towards the intersection of Wanderers and Plein, you know where that is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> H'n.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then I'm saying that there was a shot fired in the immediate vicinity of your shop, near the corner of Plein and King George.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That was the one that was disputed between the SADF and the security guard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Or the ANC ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the Police and the guard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ja, I never heard that shot either.  How long before the actual shooting did this happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Shortly before, a couple of minutes before the actual shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> A couple of minutes, no I didn't hear it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never heard that.  Then there is also evidence that shots were fired from somewhere further up - further north of De Villiers Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> But in King George?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, not in King George.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Shots in De Villiers Street and further north of that towards Park Station, you never heard any of those shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> When you say the shots came from that direction, is it more towards Wanderers side, or is it more towards Plein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Wanderers side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Wanderers side as well, no I never heard that either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As you were in your shop, you had a clear view up King George Street, past De Villiers Street, towards Noord Street, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well as far as the first line of marchers were, yes, I had a clear view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I will read to you what you said at page 2513 of the record Mr Stephens, I don't know if it was me who asked you - yes</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>"If I understand you correctly, you were standing behind the counter in your shop looking north up King George Street?"  Answer: "Correct".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>		"And did you have a clear view all the way from where you were, right up, past De Villiers Street up to Noord Street?"  --- Answer:  "Basically, yes I did."</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>Do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I do.  When - there was two parts to it, cause you said up to De Villiers up to Noord, because in the beginning in Noord Street the marchers were up to Noord and then they moved down to De Villiers, so I could only see up until the first line of marchers.  After that, obviously with the people, I wouldn't be able to see further past.  But I did have a fairly clear view, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.  But before ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Besides ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Before the marchers got to De Villiers, you could see all the way up to Noord Street, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Basically yes, a fairly good - a fairly clear view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you were inquisitive to see what was going on, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> From time to time, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I read again to you at the top of page 2515 of your evidence, I asked - bottom of 2514,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>"What was it about the group that made you concentrate them?  ---  I do not know about concentration, I was not concentrating on them, I was just basically looking at them."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>		"Yes, and you continued to look at them?" - </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>question.  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>Answer:  "Yes, because we are inquisitive to see what is going on."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>Do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now what you saw, if I understand your evidence at the inquest correctly, is that the marchers started gathering in King George Street near the intersection with Noord Street, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> It looked that way, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And this process of the marchers gathering took approximately  1/2  hour, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Give or take 10 minutes, I'd say yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The  1/2  hour is your estimation, page 2523 of the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ja, it was an approximate estimation, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the marchers were coming from all directions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I wouldn't say marchers as in groups, I'd say on the individual basis, yes - individual marchers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let met read to you at 2523, I asked you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>"You say it looked like they were coming from both sides to fill up the street?" Answer:  "Ja, they were coming one by one, two/three people sort of joining in."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>MR BERGER:	"Some were even coming up King George Street from Plein Street, walking up there as well."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Question</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>"To join the marchers?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>		Answer:  "I take it, yes."</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>		Question:  "Well the people who were going up King George Street towards the marchers seemed to you to be marchers themselves?"  Answer:  "Yes."</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>		"Going to join the march?  ---  Yes."</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And some of these people were carrying their traditional weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes, they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And they were walking from Plein Street, all they way up Plein Street, over De Villiers Street ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> King George.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I beg your pardon, all the way up King George Street, over De Villiers, continued up King George Street to Noord Street to join this group of marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.  When I say one or two, it might only have been one or two, but the majority were coming from the top end, and most of the people, or marchers that were joining, went along Plein Street, some in the Wanderers direction and some in Klein direction and actually came around and joined.  There were one or two that actually went up King George itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No you didn't say one or two, you say "some were even coming", but I won't quarrel with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Some.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And this whole process took approximately  1/2  hour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Don't hold me to it, but roundabout there, I wasn't exactly timing them, but within - like I said, within 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see Mr Stephens, what is strange about your evidence, and a lot of other evidence that you give, is that nobody, and I literally mean nobody else describes this as having happened, you stand alone on this point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I can only say what I saw.</p>

I think the thing that made me think that they were Inkatha marchers, some of them had either red bands on or some type of weapon, as in a knobkierrie or a stick, and that's the only way that I would say, but to actually say what type of clothes they were wearing, I don't know.  A big assortment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And the red bands...(inaudible), were they around their heads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ja, some were, I can't recall exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you.  This group that started at King George and Noord was approximately how big?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I'd say it was hard to say, but it was fairly biggish.  But the main time I actually noticed them properly, that it was a proper march, was when they came down to De Villiers, because by them the whole street was filled, which was a lot of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when you initially saw them they were not such a big group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well I wouldn't say a big group from where I was standing, Noord - you must remember Noord is almost three streets up, if you look from Plein to De Villiers to Noord, and they were on that side of Noord, so I just saw people gathering.  And that's why when I say people moving across in all directions, that is the way it looked at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Coming in two's and three's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ones; twos; threes, ja, basically.  Maybe more ones than twos and threes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At that stage, when the group moved down towards De Villiers Street, there were no ANC guards standing on the corner of Plein and King George, am I correct, according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I actually can't recall, but they were in that vicinity of the entrance of the Shell House, and when they moved down to De Villiers, the ANC guard came out to the pillar, and there was a Policeman with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Before - that's what I'm trying to confirm with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> H'n.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Before the ANC guard came out to the corner of Plein and King George, there were no ANC guards on that corner, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> During the day they would go there, then they'd move away; they'd go back to the entrance and they'd come back and move away and come back the whole time.  They were just roaming around there the whole time, so I can't say at that specific time, I can't recall that they all were there or weren't all there, or one or two were there, I can't recall it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see because your evidence at the inquest was the following</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>"There were not ANC guards on the corner at the critical time when the group approached the intersection of King George and De Villiers.  As they came to the intersection of King George and De Villiers, this ANC guard came out alone to the corner of King George and Plein Street."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Mmm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> At that specific time it could have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he was on that corner with a single Policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.  And when he started firing, then the whole lot of them came running out - well not running out, but they were in that vicinity, but not right on the corner itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry ...(inaudible), you keep saying "they came running out", I struggle to understand where did they come running out from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay, see Plein Street runs like this, you've got the entrance of the ANC of the Shell House which is probably 15/20 metres long, and they were all gathered in that area.  Now they've got another 5 metres or 10 metres to go to the corner, and that's where they ran from.  So they ran 5 metres - 10 metres, whatever.  So in other words whether you're saying they were actually on the corner itself or near the corner, they were in that vicinity, but maybe not at that corner at that specific time when they guard started shooting.  When the guard started shooting, then they came to the corner, the corner itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Are you trying to say to us that they appeared around the corner ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> To your line of vision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes, at that stage, yes.  We're talking now as the shooting started, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you couldn't see around the corner yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No I can, I can see them, they're standing right here in front of me, I could see them.  I think, like I said as well, most of the time we were looking more towards the marchers itself, because it's the last thing I expected is shots to go off at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  You were looking at the marchers and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Most of the time, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.  And you can't say from where this person came with the AK47, but the last 5 to 10 metres you saw him coming from the direction of the entrance towards the corner of Plein and King George?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ja, see because we saw them the whole day type - well the whole day - well that whole morning anyway we saw them, and they were all around the entrance the whole time.  And then, like I said, when the marchers were at De Villiers and King George, I saw him break away basically from the crowd and come and stand at the side there with the gun, and he got on his haunches on his knees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No you never saw him break away from the crowd, let me read to you what you said at page 2519</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Middle of the page</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>Question</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>"So you first saw the marchers, and then you saw this guard coming from the entrance of Shell House and positioning himself in King George Street?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yip.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Answer</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>"I cannot say I actually saw him coming from the entrance, I just saw him.  I probably saw the last 5 metres from the entrance, coming in that - from the direction of the entrance that I saw him standing there by the pillar with a Policeman."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Quite correct, but I didn't say he didn't come from a crowd either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Sorry can you just turn your microphone up, I can barely hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I'm probably getting slightly confused because from the exhibit given to us by Mr Dorfling, that's Exhibit E, page 26, you state at paragraph 2 that you saw an ANC security guard coming out of Shell House and standing next to the pillar and there was a SA Policeman standing next to him.  Are you still talking of the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Same person, yes I am.  So in other words I saw him come out of the - well, in the vicinity of the Shell House.  He was standing around there with the rest of the group, so in other words he had come out of the ANC basically, and from there he moved across.  So I took it he was part of the Shell House guards, because I had seen him during the day, in that morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> What made him to be so conspicuous to you, what made you to observe him ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well for starters he had an assault rifle with him and he was dressed in the ANC security guards' uniform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> What kind of a uniform would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well like I said, I noticed him having a white top on and black pants, and he was standing with the rest of the guys there, and obviously he's not going to be an Inkatha marcher if he's standing there with an assault rifle, that's the way I took it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Okay, were the other security guards that you later observed after his magazine had been finished, also wearing the same kind of uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No, they were all wearing plain clothes.  He's the only guy that I recall actually wearing the uniform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And you say it was a black and white uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Stephens, I must put it to you that firstly black and white are not the colours of the ANC; and secondly that this man was not in an ANC uniform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There's no such thing as a uniform for the ANC guards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay well I was saying a security uniform is what I meant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let's just get one thing clear Mr Stephens, you did not see this man come out of Shell House, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct I would say, yes.  If you're being specific about that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm using the words used by you in your affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well I - during the day I had seen him come out there, yes.  But I couldn't say at that time specifically that he had come out the ANC - or out of Shell House.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All you saw according ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Then it would be no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All you saw according to you was the last 5 metres from an easterly direction towards the corner of Plein and King George.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct, 5/10 metres, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He stood there at the pillar and it was just the two of them, the ANC guard and the Policeman next to each other on the corner, no-one else was around them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> At the pillar itself, no, just the two of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No-one else was near them at that corner, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct, that's at the pillar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the corner Mr Stephens, no-one was there at the corner other than this ANC guard and the Policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> How far away from the corner do you mean, at the corner itself?  Because if it's at the corner itself at the pillar I'd say no, but if it was at the corner - because you've got two corners, you've got the pillar here, and you've got the corner here, which is another 2/3 metres wide, and there some of them were standing and some of them were standing at the entrance.  I'm talking now about supposedly I took it as ANC guards, I took it as that.  They weren't in any uniform, they were in plain clothes, but they had handguns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The ANC guards you are talking about are the guards who were in Plein Street outside the entrance to Shell House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct, at the entrance as well as close to the corner.  But at the corner itself, at the pillar, it was only that I - well you're saying that there is no uniform for the ANC guard, a security guard with an assault rifle is the only ones that I saw at the pillar, which I took as the corner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me put it this way then Mr Stephens, the only two people at the corner of Plein and King George who could have seen the marchers coming down towards De Villiers Street would have been this ANC guard with the AK47 rifle, and the Policeman standing next to him, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well they definitely could see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The ANC guard standing outside the entrance to Shell House in Plein Street could not possibly have seen a crowd gathering at the corner of King George and De Villiers, agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No, they knew that they were there because they were up and down the whole time.  That's why I said they weren't in one specific space all the time, they were moving up and down.  But at that time when the shooting started, there was only the Policeman and the ANC security - well I took it as okay, the security guard that was standing there, that's all that I knew at that specific time.  Before that, 20 seconds before it, 10 seconds before it, the guys were moving up and down, so they knew exactly what was happening.  But when the shots started, there was only the guard there and the Policeman.  Ten ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> While they were outside, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ten seconds before, 15 seconds before, they could have been there, but when the shooting started, that's when I looked up and saw, and I only saw the Policeman and the security guard there, I never saw anybody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This much is clear, that those that you say were moving towards the corner and back towards the entrance, let's talk about them.  Whilst they were outside the entrance, they couldn't have seen the marchers, that's quite clear isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Quite correct, if they - when they were at the entrance they couldn't see the marchers, which is quite correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well the picture that you have in your mind is that some of them were moving backwards and forwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes, they were, the whole time, standing in groups having a chat, moving back towards the corner to see what was happening, and moving back toward the entrance again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This might be a convenient stage to take the adjournment.  We'll adjourn for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS </p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Stephens, the evidence that you've given this morning about it's possible that 15 or 10 seconds before the shooting, there were ANC guards on the corner of Plein and King George was simply not given by you at the inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Maybe it wasn't asked, because I was talking at the time of the shooting, I wasn't talking like I said, a little time before, a little time after, it was just - the moment the shooting started, there was a Policeman and a guard there, that's all that I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well I'll just summarise your evidence at the inquest very briefly.  At pages 2521 to 2522 you were - I see you have your evidence there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> 2521 in the middle of the page, you saw a guard coming from the direction of the entrance of Shell House; you saw the Policeman, you didn't know where the Policeman came from.  Then over the page you said that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Like I said over here as well, it says "coming from the direction of the entrance hall", I didn't specifically say, because I probably at that stage didn't actually see him coming out of the entrance itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then you said at the top of 2522 that the Policeman was standing at the right-hand side of the guard, he was standing at the pillar;  you said that the guard was right next to the Policeman, and then I said to you: "And at that stage it was only the two of them on the corner?".</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And your answer was you can actually recall it, you've got Small Street, Plein and then it becomes King George and Plein.  So in other words they are on the corner of King George and Plein like you said, on the easterly side.  And then I said to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>"Yes, and there is no-one else around them, it is just the two of them?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>		Answer:  "Basically, yes."</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes, basically yes.  Because basically because at the corner itself it was just the two of them.  If you're talking a couple of metres away, the other guards could have been there.  Look here, this happened four years ago, my mind is not - you know, it's something I think about everyday.  My main focus was on the guard and the Policeman and the marchers, whether they were two metres away, five metres away, I can't recall 100%.  That's why I said "basically, yes".</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see again Mr Stephens, on this point your evidence stands alone.  Nobody, no other witness puts the guard and this Policeman alone on the corner at the critical time of the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well I'm just saying as I saw it.  At that stage I saw the guard and I saw the Policeman, that's why I said basically that's all I saw at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Just to go back to the other incident where your evidence stands alone, about the marchers gathering at the corner of King George and Noord for approximately  1/2  hour, not even the marchers support you on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> What do they say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> They say they came from Park Station, they split into two groups, some came ...(inaudible), others came along De Villiers Street, and they converged at the corner, at the intersection of De Villiers and King George.  None of them talk about gathering up there in Noord Street for approximately  1/2  hour.  All of them say that they alighted from the train at Park Station and proceeded directly in the direction of Shell House.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well I can only say that's - like I said the  1/2  hour, it could have been 10 or 15 minutes either way, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Even on the 10/15 minutes, not a single marcher supports you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay, I could be wrong there, I don't know, but that's all that I saw at the time.  At that stage 1 minute could have been 5 minutes, I don't know, but I saw the marchers, the marchers were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Stephens, I put it to you that you're not being truthful at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I'm being as truthful as I remember.  But you must remember it happened four years ago, I don't think about this all the time.  At that stage it might have felt like a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also did not see a group of marchers coming ...(tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> At that stage I don't think I did see them, I just saw them basically in King George.  But like I was saying earlier as well if you read my statement, we were serving customers, it was basically business as usual to a certain degree.  So I just kept looking up and I'd just see marches getting bigger and bigger every now and then, that's all that I saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You agreed with me earlier on this morning that it was not business as usual, in fact it was quite quiet you said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes it was, but we were carrying on as usual, it was just a quiet period, because we do have quiet periods in the shop as well, which is still business as usual.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We know that a large group of marchers came along De Villiers Street from West to east, and congregated in the intersection.  You never saw that, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now your evidence is that this group that came down from Noord Street to the intersection of De Villiers and King George, stopped for a couple of minutes in the intersection, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you were observing them, and yet you say nothing happened in that intersection for those minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Not that I can recall, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> For example, you did not see two white policemen in uniform, running up from Plein Street up King George to De Villiers ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> With arms outstretched in an attempt to keep the marchers away from Shell House.  You never saw that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I can't recall that, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw a tall, thin, white man with long hair, arms outstretched, trying to prevent the marchers from coming towards Shell House?  You never saw that either, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And all of this was going on in the intersection at the time when the group was also in that intersection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Could be, I don't know, but I never saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw the two white policemen being pushed out of the way by this group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Nope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw the group engulfing this tall, thin, white man with the long hair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And yet you say this group wasn't attacking.  How can you say that if you never saw these significant moments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I can only see what I saw, and at - I didn't see them attacking anybody.  They could have, I didn't say they never attacked anybody, I said I never saw them attack anybody.  Whether they did or didn't, that's another thing.  If you got other witnesses that did see it, well maybe it did happen, but I never saw it personally, so I can't say it did or it did not happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also saw approximately 10 blue uniformed policemen at the corner of King George and De Villiers before the marchers got to the intersection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes I could have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would you like me to refresh your memory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Look here, it was a long time ago, if I said it at that stage, it could have been.  I had seen Policemen the whole day in small groups of two's, maybe fours milling around there during the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Page 2529, top of the page,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>"You saw approximately 10 blue uniformed Policemen standing in the area of the intersection of King George and De Villiers before the marchers got there?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>		Answer:  "Correct."</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>Do you not recall that Mr Stephens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Not right now, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You told the inquest that there were three policemen on the inside of King George, and two or three on the western side of King George just standing looking at the marchers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ja there were - at that stage there were policemen around there, but to tell you the exact amount now, I'd be lying because I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you see, there weren't these policemen, three on the east and two/three on the west standing looking at the marchers up there at the intersection of King George and De Villiers.  It didn't happen.  So where do you get this evidence from Mr Stephens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I can only tell you that's what I saw at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But the fact is that it never happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Is it a fact?  So in fact there were no policemen there, is that what you're saying, is it a fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Not at that intersection.  The only two policemen at that intersection were Van Greenen and Van Reenen, the two that I described to you, who ran up from King George towards De Villiers with arms outstretched to stop the marchers, and you never saw them, but you saw others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Maybe they were part of them that I saw.  It actually says over here</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>"And where they still there when the marchers reached De Villiers Street?", and I said:  "I cannot recall that."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>If you actually read there.  So at the time - I'm not saying that they were there, cause I actually said "I cannot recall that."</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes but if you'll turn over the page to page 2530 Mr Stephens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The Court asked you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>"There were a couple of Police where?  What is - you seem to have a picture in your mind of policemen."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>		Answer:  "Say four - say two or three on either side of King George; three on the east side, two or three on the west side."</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Basically ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then I ask you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>"Just standing there looking at the marchers?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>		Answer:  "Basically yes."</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>Then we go on a little bit further,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>"You did not see them trying to control the marchers?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>		Answer:  "No."</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>		"Then at some point after a few minutes of pause, the group crossed De Villiers towards King George, correct?"  </p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>		"Correct."  </p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>Sorry, towards Plein, you say "yes" towards Plein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Can I just read this quickly?  Okay I've said here,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>"And when the group got to De Villiers Street, you cannot recall seeing any Policemen in the vicinity of the group?  No, I do not know.  What I can remember is there was a couple of Policemen there, whether they moved around the corner or went away, I do not know."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>That's what I'm saying, so by the time the marchers got there, the policemen moved away.  Does it not say there, unless I'm reading it incorrectly, I don't know, your Worship - Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> On a point of clarification, Mr Berger, how soon would you say, Mr Stephens, after observing the uniformed policemen, did you notice the marchers converging at the intersection of King George and Plein Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Just repeat that please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How soon after you had observed the uniformed policemen, did you then notice the marchers converging at the corner of King George and Plein Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> They'd already converged on De Villiers and King George, they had already converged when the guard came out.  And he was - and that's when he got on his knees, on his haunches and he aimed towards them, and then when they walked across, that's when he started firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I probably haven't made myself quite clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> See, in your - you've just stated to Mr Berger that you agree with what you've said before the inquest court, that you saw approximately 10 blue uniformed policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> What page is that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> That's on page 2529.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Berger has just put it to you that that's what you said during the inquest, that you saw approximately 10 blue uniformed Policemen standing in the area of the intersection of King George and De Villiers before the marchers got there.  And you say it was before the marchers got there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay, which is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Now my question is, how soon did you notice the marchers converging at that corner, after you had observed the 10 blue uniformed Policemen you've alluded here at page 2529?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I can't recall, it might - don't know, can't recall.  Because the lead-up to the marchers coming down, I saw Policemen in the street.  Whether they were at the top there, in the street I saw the Policemen.  When the actual march started when they crossed De Villiers, I never saw any Policemen after that, I can't recall seeing any policemen after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are you not even able to assist us in approximating in terms of seconds or minutes, or hours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No, because as you can see, the time that I mentioned before, I've been held to that time now, where at the time I wasn't sure what time it was, and I just took a guess at 30 minutes, maybe give or take, and I wasn't sure.  And I'm not sure, I can't say any minutes, otherwise I'm gonna be held again to it, and I am not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Because it actually says here, and I don't understand where Mr Berger - where the confusion is coming in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just clarify something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The impression I get from the evidence that's been put to you about what you said at the inquest, is that these policemen were watching the marchers, doing nothing, when you noticed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now where were the marchers at that point, were they at the intersection already ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Of De Villiers, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So they'd obviously got to that intersection, they were static at that point, and the Policemen were watching them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Because then they go on to ask you whether they intervened in some way, and you say no, not that you can remember, etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Not that I saw, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And then after that the shooting happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct, once they crossed the street - by then the Police had moved up towards the marchers.  Maybe that's when - like Mr Berger says, they did try and stop them, I don't know.  In that - maybe it was a question of 5/10 seconds where they were holding their hands up and telling the guys not to march.  I might have been looking away in those 5/10 seconds, that's why I never saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just in terms of time, and not to pin you down, this is not the exercise, we're trying to get your help here, but we're talking more in terms of tens of seconds rather than tens of minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Quite right, one or two minutes, something like that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Stephens, there is no confusion on your evidence, your evidence at the inquest was, and I'll do it very briefly, 2529, you saw approximately 10 blue uniformed policemen at that intersection of King George and De Villiers before the marchers got there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then I asked you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>"And where they still there when the marchers reached De Villiers Street?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I said "I cannot recall that."</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No, not correct, "I cannot recall that." - sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then over the page 2530, I continued to ask you, I said, confirming what you had already just said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>"And when the group got to De Villiers, ..." this is at the top of 2530.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yip.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>MR BERGER:	"... you cannot recall seeing any Policemen in the vicinity of the group?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>		Answer:  "No, there were - I do not know.  What I can remember is there were a couple of Police there, whether they moved around the corner or they went away, I do not know."</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then the Court said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>"There were a couple of Police where?  What is - you seem to have a picture in your mind of Policemen."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>Your answer:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>"Say four, say two or three on either side of King George, three on the east side, and two or three on the west side."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yip.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Question from me</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>"Standing there looking at the marchers?"   Answer:  "Basically yes."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>Now it's quite clear what you are saying, two or three blue uniformed Policemen on the west side of King George, three blue uniformed Policemen on the east side of King George - all of this is happening at the intersection of De Villiers when the marchers are there and the Policemen are just looking at the marchers, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ja, that was before the march, because if you go to page 2529 which is still part of the questioning, it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>"And were they still there when the marchers reached De Villiers Street?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>And I said:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>"I cannot recall that because I was looking more at the marchers than the Police."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>And this is all in the same questioning, you can't just take a little context out and say okay, now that's the answer for it, you got to look at the whole thing, and that was part of the - this is continuing from 2529.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Stephens, if you look at the top of 2530,</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yip.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I used your words when I said "when the group got to De Villiers Street, you cannot recall seeing any Policemen in the vicinity of the group".</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> And I said "no".</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And your answer was "no".</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> So by then they'd moved away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No Mr Stephens, please just read what you got there, you don't say "they'd moved away", you said "no, there were - I do not know.  What I can remember is there were a couple of Police there".  You don't say they moved away, you say the opposite.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Then it says further on</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>"Whether they moved around the corner or they went away, I do not know."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I actually don't know what you're actually getting at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well what I'll put to you Mr Stephens, is that whichever way you want to take this evidence, its stands alone.  None of the policemen ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> But here it says here</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>"And when the group got to De Villiers Street, you cannot recall seeing any policemen in the vicinity of the group?    No, there were - I do not know.  What I can remember is there were a couple of policemen there at that time.  Whether they moved around the corner or they went away, I do not know."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me move on Mr Stephens.  As the group comes across De Villiers Street into King George, this guard with the AK47 opens fire whilst on his haunches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he fires straight into the group of marchers, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's the way it looked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The Policeman just stood next to him doing nothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's the way it looked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Stephens this is your evidence I'm referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> What page are you on now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well that is your evidence, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No sooner had the group crossed De Villiers, than the guard opened fire, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well they basically just about crossed De Villiers, yes.  They'd come to the end of De Villiers Street when the guard started shooting.  It wasn't that they were on the other side of De Villiers and then he started shooting, it was only once they'd - they were in King George, and if that's the road, as they came to the end of De Villiers, that's basically when they started shooting, give or take a metre or two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As they entered into King George Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Basically as they had just about crossed De Villiers Street, almost into King George, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And this ANC guard emptied an entire ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Security guard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> You said security guard - ja, you said it - okay, ANC guard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I said "this ANC guard".</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Emptied an entire magazine on the marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No I didn't say that, I said that he shot on automatic and I wasn't sure if he had emptied - if he had actually finished the whole round.  I just took it for granted because I didn't think this he's gonna change the magazine if it wasn't empty.  So I take it that he did finish it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> For how long did he shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> 10/15 seconds, I'm not sure, but ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well I won't keep you to that, in your evidence in the inquest you said "a good 15 to 20 seconds".  You said he fired 7 to 10 bursts, a good 15 to 20 seconds before he released, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then he re-loaded and then he started firing on single shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the policeman was still standing next to him doing nothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's the way it looked to me, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Again Mr Stephens, your evidence on this stands alone.  No-one else describes the shooting in this way, but it's what you saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That I did see, yes, and I was right there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who else fired shots at the marchers, you've mentioned the ANC guard with the AK47, who else fired shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> And there was a guy with a green uniform - a green - it looked like a safari-suite, but it was like a matching top and pants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Green?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Green.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And besides the man in green, who else fired shots at the marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well I only saw one other person that I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> It was another one of the guys that was standing around there, that I took as part of the ANC ...(indistinct), round - that was hovering around, but I can't say he was part of them or wasn't, but that was the only other person.  So there were basically three people that I saw shoot - actually fire, but my main concentration was on the guard that was shooting as well as the guy that ran across the road because he was quite - it was quite explicit where he was actually coming from.  And at that stage I was outside the shop as well, and that's why I saw him, and that's when I ran back inside again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Again, your evidence about the man in green absolutely stands alone.  No-one else talks about this man, no Policeman, no ANC guard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well all I can tell you is I definitely saw him, and I'm under oath, and I swear to God, I saw him.  I saw him shoot, I was there, I saw it.  Whether nobody else saw it, it's the same as other things that I never saw, whether other people didn't see it as well, I don't know.  But I saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> And I've no reason to lie either.  In fact it would be in my better interest not to be here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you've been subpoenaed haven't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Only after I gave a statement to the Police, but I actually didn't want to let it come to this.  So I would definitely not make up things, I can assure you of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The other man who was shooting, now not the man in green and not the ANC guard with the AK47, where was he shooting from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> He was standing next to the pillar on the corner there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Same pillar where the policeman and the ANC guard was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> More to the right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> More to your right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> More to their right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> And mine, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now these two, the man on the right and the man in green, they only started shooting at a time when the AK47 was being fired on single fire, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That I could recall, yes.  That's the only time I noticed them because if you can imagine this assault rifle shooting on automatic, I think any other little handgun, you basically not even gonna hear it, so they could have been shooting before that, but at the time I didn't see it, because I only heard the AK basically, or the assault rifle.  So they might have been shooting before, but I never heard them at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it your evidence, or wasn't it your evidence that the other ANC members only came out and started firing after the man with the AK47 was shooting on single-fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That I noticed, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And so at the time when he was shooting on automatic, that 15 to 20 second period, there was no-one else at that corner firing shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I didn't say ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In fact there no-one else at that corner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I said that there was nobody else that I noticed shooting.  So in other words, according to my statement, they wouldn't be shooting because I never noticed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me read to you what you said at page 2536, Mr Stephens, line 11</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>"When his magazine was finished, he then re-loaded and started shooting on single-fire.  Other ANC members afterwards," this is now after he was shooting on single-fire, "with 9mm came out and also started firing, okay, and also started firing on the crowd, and that is what happened."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That I noticed, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then I asked you the question</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>"So the other ANC members, the man in the green safari-suite, the other one with the 9mm who fired, they only came out from the entrance and started firing after this man with the AK47 was already shooting on single-fire, correct?  --- That's what it looks there - and that is not correct, because when he started firing, that is when everybody came out, but I only noticed the guy that fired with the green uniform afterwards."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>		"In other words when he was shooting on single-shot?  ---  I do not know if he was there before because what was happening, when he was shooting on single-shot other people was still coming out as well.  I do not know if they were inside the building, they had come down, or whatever, but they came out afterwards."</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.  So in other words, if you read over here</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>"That is not correct, because when he started firing, in other words on automatic, that is when everybody came out, but I only noticed that the guy had fired with the green uniform afterwards."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>	So in other words when he started shooting on automatic the other guys came running out, and I noticed a couple of them standing there, whether it was all of them -but guys - obviously they came to see what was going on, that the guy was shooting on automatic.  And I only noticed them shooting when he put it on single-shot, and the reason for that is, it took a couple of seconds to change the magazine and it probably drew my attention to the fact that I heard other shots because now the assault rifle had stopped firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Please turn to page 2538 Mr Stephens, line 17, this is not when you're trying to get the attention of the Policeman</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>"You wanted to get his attention so that he could stop this man from now shooting on single-fire?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>this the man with the AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Your answer</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>"That is right, because by then the other guards had not started firing yet."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ja, that I noticed.  According to me they hadn't started firing yet, maybe they had have, I don't know.  But at that stage I did not see them shooting, or recall them shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> See Mr Stephens your evidence is quite clear, the 15 to 20 second burst with the AK47 was fired directly into this crowd by the ANC guard standing alone on the corner with a Policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's only after that the he gets joined by ANC guards from the entrance of Shell House.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No I didn't say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> With the greatest respect to my learned friend, the witness has answered this question on numerous occasions.  What the witness said is after that gentleman - after he saw that gentleman firing on automatic fire, only after that did he realise that somebody else was not also firing.  He never said nobody was firing before that point in time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> You see, the thing is everything that's written down here, I can only answer from what I saw.  They might have been shooting beforehand, I can't say that they were or they weren't, because I can only say - and that's what I've written in my statement here, is what I actually saw.  And whether I noticed a minute later or five seconds later that somebody else was also shooting, you must realise that assault rifle is quite a loud shot compared to a little 9mm or a handgun for whatever calibre it is, and it might have been drowning.  When he was shooting on automatic obviously it was drowning the other bullets out, I don't know, I can't say because they might not even have been shooting, I don't know.  But according to your witnesses they say that they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me read to you what you said in your statement that you wrote shortly after the event.  You talk about in paragraph - this is page 26 of Exhibit E, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>"The IFP or Zulu marchers", paragraph 3, "were gathered at the top end of King George.  When they approached De Villiers Street coming down in King George, this ANC security guard then started firing on these marchers with his automatic rifle - think it was AK47, he was shooting on automatic."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then paragraph 4</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>"When his magazine was finished he then re-loaded and then started shooting on single-fire.  Other ANC members with 9mm pistols or pistols then came out and also started firing on the crowd."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Statement is very clear Mr Stephens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That the other ANC members with 9mm pistols only came out and started firing on the crowd at a time when the ANC guard was shooting on single-fire, it's clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That's not the way it was because - well that's - I don't obviously express myself very well, because some of them had been there while he was firing, so...</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well that wasn't your evidence at the inquest, it's not in your statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay, where - just show me where in the inquest, because everytime I've gone through it I think I've sort of proved you wrong, so I'd like to know - because you keep making these statements and you're not upholding it.  You even twisting words inside here, and when I read it out to you again it doesn't come out the same way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me just read to you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger may I just intervene at this stage to find out now where are we getting with all this detailed cross-examination on minor differences between what he said here and what was said earlier, and so on.  How is the amnesty process advanced by this kind of evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, this witness says that there was a man with an AK47 who opened fire on a crowd for 15 to 20 seconds.  That evidence stands alone, there's no evidence to support that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> So what you're saying the AK ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) (microphone not on) and we're not beginning a trial here, I want you to appreciate that please.  ...(inaudible).  We've got his evidence, we've got the record of the evidence at the inquest ...(inaudible).  There are differences between what he's saying now and what ...(inaudible) at the inquest.  You can make whatever point you wish to make, ...(inaudible).  I'm not going to stop you from continuing your questioning, but I'm just concerned that maybe ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As the Committee pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Berger, may I try to be on the same page probably with your cross-examination?  Has it not been one of the applicant's version that there was a man who leaned against a pillar from the position which is nearly the same as that alluded to by Mr Stephens, who fired an AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> But wasn't that one of the applicants Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And it's Mr Beea if I remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, no ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I can't remember then the name of the applicant exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's Mr Khumalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Khumalo, that's right.  So I think probably we do understand where you want to get us to, but I think you must just try and reconcile that with the criteria that we have to use as a Committee.  If you could just curtail your cross-examination to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I will.  Ms Khampepe, it's not in dispute that there was a man with an AK47 at the time, but you would have gathered from the evidence of the ANC guards, and in fact the evidence of policemen who were on the scene as well, that the ANC guards were all in a group on the corner of Plein and King George when the shooting began, which is - stands in stark contrast to the evidence of this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> No I'm sure we are fully aware of that by now, you've really traversed quite a lot to make that crystal clear, we now understand what your cross-examination is aiming at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I think what you're trying to say is - you know, the thing is, I saw a guard standing there with the policeman.  Now you're saying that the rest of the guards were all standing there with him.  Within 4/5 metres they might have been, because you've got two pillars here - when you standing with him, I meant - I took it that you're talking them actually standing around the guy with the AK47, which I did not notice at that stage, they were a good 2 or 3 metres away from him, towards the corner because - but I think we're splitting hairs here you know, it's very - it's a small thing this here.  Basically the guard did shoot, other ANC members also shot, and I think that's the basic evidence, I don't know whether the guys were 2 metres or 3 metres away, what difference that actually does make.  I've never said that they weren't there, they were there, and I've even said that they were shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I think the problem Mr Stephens, we don't want to debate this, Mr Berger is a bit worried about what you stated quite earlier on when the issues were quite fresh in your mind, as he has referred us to page 26, particularly at paragraph 24, where you state quite clearly that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Sorry is that 22 ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Page 26 of ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> 2526?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, page 26.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> No, page 26, that's Exhibit E, the statement that was handed over by Mr Dorfling to us this morning, where you are now - you are stating that the guards came out only after the man with an AK47 had finished his magazine and had re-loaded and was now only firing single shots.  And we understand the ambit of - the thrust of your cross-examination Mr Berger, to that extent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> No because I only then noticed the ANC members coming out and also started firing.  So only then that I noticed it.  You must realise when I wrote this, it was abbreviated, it wasn't an in-depth ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just clarify one thing.  It seems clear to me from what you've been saying that your attention was focused on the man who was shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You didn't - the other people that were in his vicinity weren't shooting as far as you can recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Not that I noticed ja, it was like a blur because I basically, like I said in my statement before, I was basically watching the guy with the AK47 and the marchers diving behind cars, and it's only then afterwards that I noticed the other guys there shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> When things slowed down and there was a changing of magazines and so-one, then you became aware of other people on your version, coming out, that's how you express it ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And then they start shooting as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That I noticed them shooting.  That's why I said, they could have been shooting beforehand, I'm not disputing that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> It's the same with other - the guys on the roof on the other side on that parapet, or whatever you call it - on a balcony, I never even noticed those people, but they were there.  That's why I'm saying, it could have been but I never noticed it, so I can only say what I saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I say this, if there were people standing in close proximity to this man with the AK47 that was on his haunches, would you have seen them?  Did you actually see them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I saw them, yes, I did see them, but I didn't - how can I say, thought that they were participating at that stage, because they were at the corner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see, the impression that you give us in your evidence is that you didn't see them, but you only noticed them later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Well that is basically what happened.  That's why I'm not saying they weren't there, they could have been there, but at that stage my focus was on the guy with the AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> They could have been there, but I never really noticed them as such, and that's why my evidence that I give might be a little misleading in a way - to the nitty gritty, to great detail, which I don't have unfortunately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Stephens, when the guard with the AK47 opened fire, were you watching him, or were you attending to business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I was watching him.  Because when he started aiming I knew that something was gonna happen because the people were too far away for anything to really start happening, and for him to start aiming at them at that distance, I just thought something's gonna happen, and I don't realise why it's gonna happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw a marcher with an AK47 firing in King George Street between De Villiers and Plein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Unfortunately I did not it, no, and I never heard it either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, there was a witness, a Mr Diaz, who worked in a shop in King George Street, directly in your line of vision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> I don't dispute that, he could have seen it, but I never saw it, so I can't say I did.  Like I say, I never heard it, whether he did or didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he said that at the time this man with the AK47 was firing, the marchers were approximately 10 metres past his shop, Mr Diaz's shop, towards Plein Street, and he put his shop, the entrance to his shop as approximately 20 metres from the corner of De Villiers.  In other words, what he was say was, at the time that this man with the AK47 was firing, the marchers were approximately 30 metres into King George Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Between De Villiers and ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Plein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Plein.  No, I disagree with that, because as they crossed, they weren't even 5/10 metres, they basically got up to the car when he started firing, so I would disagree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> A Policeman by the name of Skippers also saw a marcher with an AK47 between De Villiers and Plein Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> He could have, I never saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Your evidence is that the guy with the AK47 opened up, after 15 to 20 seconds he reloaded, and the road was basically clear except for the people who were hiding behind the cars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And was only then that the two other ANC people, the one in green and the one not in green, started firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> That I noticed.  They could have started firing before that, but I never noticed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If that was your evidence, you certainly would have told the inquest court that as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> But I just realised that whatever I'm saying now I'm getting held it, it's like the nitty gritty, we're going into great detail.  At that stage it was just you know, basically suddenly things were happening, I didn't realise that this was the way it was gonna lead.  I know I've got to watch what I say now, and I can't recall everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> For the record Mr Stephens, we went into great detail at the inquest as well.  You never heard any warning shots being fired, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Nope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you're absolutely certain that the very first shots you heard that morning were shots fired by the man with the AK47 into the crowd?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Yes, that I heard, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The white person, the white man with the long hair who you never saw, testified that this crowd at the corner of King George and De Villiers were waving their weapons and then proceeded down King George Street towards Plein Street on full charge, in the manner of carrying out an attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> If that's the perception he got, I can't say that it's not.  That's his perception, and that's his version, but from where I was standing it did not look like a charge, it looked like the start of a march.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Just one aspect with your leave, Mr Chair.  Mr Stephens can I hand you a map depicting the scene, and I would like you to with reference to this map, just indicate with the red pen with the letter "O" - I see there's another red mark, it might be misleading on another place on the map, but with the red letter "O" where your business concern was situated, from where your view was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Okay.  Okay, can I just see if I'm understanding that correct, you wanna know where the guy with the AK47 was standing, where he was shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> No, I want you to with the letter "O" point your business concern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Oh business concern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Your business premises.  Before you hand back the map, can you at the same time with the letter "P" perhaps indicate where the gentleman with the automatic assault rifle was positioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>Mr Stephens in conclusion may I ask you whether from your vantage point where you were positioned, can you from that point actually observe the main entrance to Shell House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> From my shop to the main entrance, yes I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  If that could just be handed to the Committee.  That's unfortunately the only one I've got, may I beg leave to just get it back once it's been ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a>	I've got no further questions to the witness, thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Stephens thank you very much, you're excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEPHENS:</span> Thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, I'm ready with the next witness, I've just been talking to my learned friend who has a watching brief on the South African Police Services.  It would appear that it's not advisable to start with the evidence in chief now and commence after lunch, I would rather have us adjourn now, we might perhaps just start a bit earlier if you so wish, and then proceed with the evidence in chief of the next witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your reason for not starting now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> It's virtually lunch, it's 12 minutes to lunch time, we would probably not even finish the evidence in chief of this witness, I'd rather have us adjourn perhaps 10 minutes and start 10 minutes earlier, to have the evidence in chief and the cross-examination in one session.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well on the understanding that we do start 10 minutes earlier ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, may I indicate, unbeknown to me I have made an arrangement to meet someone at between 1 and 2, but of course I may have to cut it short in order to be here, but there's no reason I submit, why we can't use the 10 minutes now available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well now Mr Bizos, if we did there's gonna be very little difference in the totality of all this evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then whilst your absence is gonna be missed by me, I'm sure that we'll be seeing more of you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>GENERAL LAUGHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will adjourn now and we will resume at 13h50.</p>

<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I've been told that on - those who have difficulty, his evidence in Afrikaans can be heard on channel 4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">J M S POTGIETER:</span> (Duly sworn in, states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Chairperson, Sergeant, you are a Sergeant that is stationed at the Border Police, Johannesburg International Airport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> On the 28th of March 1994 you were a Constable in the South African Police, and on that day you were stationed at the Small Street Satellite Police Station, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is there not another way that we can do this, because one is hearing English and Afrikaans at the same time?  Is it not possible for the interpreter to sit in the panel - in the booth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>CHANNELS BEING TESTED BY INTERPRETER - CONTINUED ON TAPE 3</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> ... of March 1994, Sergeant, you were stationed at Small Street Satellite Police Station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> During that morning you were posted for service at Shell House, and more specifically on the corners of King George and Plein Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Originally we were posted to patrol in the station, and the Colonel gave us the instruction to patrol at Shell House.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Were you on foot when you were posted at Shell House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> We were transported there with a vehicle, but at that stage we were on foot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Did you see any Zulu marchers going past Shell House when you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Shortly before what is known now as the chief shooting incident, certain events took place in which you were involved.  Can you briefly describe what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I was on the corner of Plein and Klein Streets.  We heard a gunshot in a western direction, we ran in that direction.  When we crossed King George we heard shots being fired from the back of us.  We took shelter, turned back and saw that there was an ANC guard, and we gave him the order to stop firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You said that there was an ANC guard on the parapet and you gave him the order to stop firing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Did you see him firing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I heard him shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> What happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> We stood up and moved back in the direction of Klein Street.  When we crossed King George we saw a group of protest-marchers in King George Street at Noord Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You therefore moving down from west to east in Plein Street in the direction of King George Street at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Where exactly did you see the protest-marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> They were in King George Street on the corner of Noord Street.  It was a large group, they were in King George street between De Villiers and Noord.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> In what direction were these marchers moving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> They were moving southwards down King George?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> In the direction of De Villiers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Where exactly was your position at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I was on the corner of Plein and King George.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> And what happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Then between 10 and 15 ANC guards arrived on the scene.  Sergeants Van Reenen and Van Greenen moved northward up from Plein Street in the direction of De Villiers in order to prevent the approaching Zulus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Were there any other Police members with you where you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Myself and Sergeant Gollach.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> What happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I was with the ANC guards and Sergeant van Reenen that was with the ANC guards, that stood between them and Sergeant van Reenen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> So you were more or less in the vicinity of the corners of King George and Plein Streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Between 10 to 15 ANC guards, those that you saw there, were they armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Which arms did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Handguns as well as a man with an AK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> What happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I turned around and looked at Sergeant van Reenen and the others to see what was happening, then when I turned around again and ANC guard was pointing a weapon at my chest and told me to leave or he would shoot me personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> In other words you looked northward up King George and De Villiers Street in the direction of the protest-marchers; after that you turned around, you were still on that corner and at that stage the weapon was pressed against your chest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I moved around and saw that the man was serious.  I went to stand behind them.  From there I looked in the direction of De Villiers Street and saw Sergeant van Reenen and Sergeant van Greenen being pushed out of the way, in the directions of east and west.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Just a moment, you said that you moved around them, you are now referring to the ANC guards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> What do you mean when you say that you moved around them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> If I stood like this, I moved around them to the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Were they in a specific formation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No they were just a group of people standing there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You took your position in behind them and looked in the direction of De Villiers Street - north, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> They told us that they would shoot, upon which we told them not to shoot, and upon the moment that Sergeant van Reenen and the others were pushed out of the way, the shots were fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Where did the shots get fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> From De Villiers over the street corners into King George, that was approximately 5 to 6 steps from the corners when they pushed the two officials out of the way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> So these protest-marchers crossed De Villiers Street, they were moving in a southward direction, and you say that the front part moved into King George approximately 5 to 6 metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> And when the shots were fired, did you know from where they were fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> From among the guards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Are those the guards behind which you took your position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> What did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> When the shots - while they were still shooting we kept on asking them "don't shoot, don't shoot", but when the shots went off I ran around the building to see what had happened to Sergeants van Reenen and Van Greenen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> When you say that you ran behind the building - or around the building, do you mean from east to west down Plein and then north into Klein, and then once again west into De Villiers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, from west to east in Klein and then from east to west in De Villiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> So you ran past the main entrance of Shell House, around the Shell House building, into De Villiers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Until the stage that the first shots were fired, did you watch the protest-marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Correct, it was one image from where I stood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Did you see any fire-arms among the marchers at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> This Committee has heard evidence that the protest-marchers shot in the direction of either Shell House or where the guards were standing; that the marchers stormed forward in the direction of the ANC guards and that the ANC guards were under the impression that an attack was being launched on them.  What is your reaction to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I heard no shots from that side, they didn't run, they were toyi-toying, it was sort of a jogging motion at a metre distance tempo, they didn't dash.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> On the day of the incident, 28th of March 1994, how many years of service had you behind you in the South African Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Almost two years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Were you at any stage before that day involved in marches, specifically where Zulus were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, that's correct, part of my functions were to assist in marches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> The image that you had in the direction of De Villiers Street, the group which you saw moving forward, was their behaviour in any way different to the experience that you had had of such marches before that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, they were basically just toyi-toying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Just one question please, Chairperson.  Sergeant, earlier that morning, you were in the vicinity of Lancet Hall, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Did you attempt to enter Lancet Hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> From where did you attempt to enter Lancet Hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> The motor-gate in Von Weilligh Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> When you went there was the gate in order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> It was in order, I broke it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Did you break it yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> In order to gain entry because the front gates were locked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Is it Sergeant Potgieter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Can we first of all deal with the shooting a few minutes before the main shooting in Plein Street, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Ja we heard the shots, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You can speak in Afrikaans if you like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Those shots, those first shots that you heard, they came from the direction of Wanderers Street, corner of Wanderers and Plein, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And is it also correct that a number of Policemen then went to investigate what was going on down in Wanderers Street - you started off going in that direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And is it also correct Sergeant, that the reason you went in that direction was because one of the ANC guards came to your group of Policemen and said "they're shooting at us, please go and investigate"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, we heard shots and we went to investigate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were with - at that time you were with Sergeant van Reenen and Sergeant van Greenen, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> And Gollach.  I don't know about Van Greenen, but Gollach definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Gollach was there, and Van Reenen was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You went in that direction to investigate and then there was a shot behind you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And is it also correct that behind you at the time, there were ANC guards and there were also members of the SADF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I know about the ANC guards, but not about the National Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say that that shot that you heard behind you came from the ANC, but is it correct that you don't really know who fired that shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct, we saw a man with a shotgun on the parapet, that's all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You only saw one ANC guard on the parapet with a shotgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That shot that you heard which you attributed to the ANC, was that the only shot that you heard which you would have attributed to the ANC before the main shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There were no other shots in and around the vicinity of Shell House prior to the main shooting other than this particular shot we're talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, not that I know of, it's only those shots that we heard that made us run in that direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Prior to that shot, or the shots which you heard coming from the direction of Wanderers Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If one has a look at your affidavit, paragraph 13 - page 13 sorry, paragraph 3, this is where you deal with the shooting from the direction of Wanderers Street, and that's where you say that you Sergeant Gollach and Sergeant van Reenen ran in that direction, you say there</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>"While we were busy running in that direction people came out or appeared on the balcony of Shell House with shotguns, which they shot over our heads at a group of Zulus who were in Wanderers Street."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> In my affidavit I say that there were people on the balcony, but not that people appeared on the balcony, meaning that they were already there.  I didn't say that they had appeared on the balcony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> They shot with shotguns from the balcony ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Towards the people - marchers in Wanderers Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I don't want to nitpick with you, but your evidence was that there was one person, and this was the same point that was raised at the inquest, one point with the shotgun, and you can't explain why in your affidavit you speak about a number of people with shotguns, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What is not disputed is that there was a group of marchers in Wanderers Street and you and Sergeant van Reenen - or Sergeant van Reenen and Sergeant Gollach were of a view that there were shots had come from their direction, and that's why you went in the direction to investigate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> The shots came from that direction, but we don't know exactly if they came from the Zulus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you saw them there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And would you confirm your evidence at page 3101 of the record that there two or three shots ahead of you, that's from the direction of the marchers in Wanderers Street, one shot from behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you were coming back, is it correct that you didn't go further down Wanderers Street because you - I beg you pardon, Plein Street towards Wanderers Street, because that group had now disappeared?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were now coming back towards Shell House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And I take it you can't dispute that Sergeant - or was it Constable Scheepers was also with you at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, I didn't see him personally, I know that he had been posted there at Shell House.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He stated in his statement and he also stated in evidence, that as he was crossing King George Street in Plein Street moving in an easterly direction, he saw a marcher with an AK47 approaching down King George Street between De Villiers and Plein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, at that stage they weren't that close.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you ever see a marcher with an AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And no stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you never saw a marcher firing an AK47 either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you were standing on that corner for the entire duration of the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also wouldn't be able to explain or comment on the evidence of Mr Diaz, you heard me put it earlier this morning whilst you were in here to Mr Stephens, that Mr Diaz says there was a man with an AK47, in fact firing.  In his statement he says: "spraying Shell House", but then in his evidence later, he said: "firing an AK47 into the air", right in front of his shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No I didn't see somebody like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He was there, you ought to have seen him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> If he had been there we would have seen him, we were in the street, but I didn't see that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also never saw any marcher shooting towards Shell House at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, I saw no shots being fired from that side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We know that shots were in fact fired at Shell House, but you didn't see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I didn't hear or see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You had received no specific instructions when you arrived at Shell House other - from Major Nel, other than to do general patrols around Shell House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were quite worried were you not, that you as Policemen were under-staffed, should any trouble break out at Shell House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> At that stage we didn't think that any difficulties or problems would arise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> During the evidence at the inquest it was either Sergeant Gollach or Sergeant Scheepers who said that - I asked them "were you not afraid what should you do if trouble broke out", and the one of them's evidence was "yes I was afraid, in fact I asked Sergeant Potgieter what we should do and I discussed it with him, and he also didn't know, he was also afraid".</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> At that stage I wasn't a Sergeant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well he spoke about Potgieter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, I can't remember anything like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The Policeman in charge was Major Els, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And at the critical time of the shooting he was nowhere to be found, is that also correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And I see a smile coming onto your lips because you know what the next question is, isn't it correct that you pulled him out from under a car, he was hiding under a car during the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He had been - just before he took cover under a car, he had been at the corner of Plein and Klein Streets, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct, that's where the car was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that's where you found him taking cover?</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now the ANC guards who came to the corner of King George and Plein Street, came in a group - there were a number of them who came to the corner, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You told the Committee today that they were armed with handguns and an AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> In as far as I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Those would be 9mm handguns and one AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, one could call them handguns, 9mm 762's as well as AK's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So when you say in paragraph 5 of your statement at page - of your affidavit at page 14, that:  "They had shotguns and 9mm pistols", that's incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I can't remember everything, but I know about the pistols and the AK, a man was lying there and shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This evidence of an ANC guard pointing a gun at you and saying that he would shoot at you, that's not correct is it Sergeant Potgieter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> It is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You made this up after the event didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Negative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Other than the shots that you've testified to about down at Wanderers Street and the one shot behind you, there were no other shots prior to the actual shooting incident, you've already said that to the Committee.  You never heard any shots in De Villiers Street shortly before the main shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never heard any shots coming from the direction of Park Station shortly before the main shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And at that time you were stationed at the corner of Plein and King George?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You'll recall Sergeant Potgieter, that when you gave evidence in the inquest we did an exercise in Court and we - to get an approximation of how long the shooting lasted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And we agreed that it was approximately 12 seconds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> From the time that the marchers were shot at until the shooting ended, 12 seconds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, approximately that long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And at no stage did you hear any warning shots being fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And also at no stage did you witness any shots being fired into the overhanging ceiling at the corner of Plein and King George?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, because we know from the ballistic evidence that shots were fired into that overhanging ceiling, and we know specifically that two 9mm shots were fired, to use the words of the expert "directly upon into the overhanging ceiling at the corner of King George and Plein", you never witnessed that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, I don't know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's your evidence that there was an initial shot from amongst the group of ANC guards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> There was the one shot, and then a millisecond later the gross shooting took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw a man in green running across the road and firing shots down the western pavement of King George Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now you saw Sergeant van Reenen and Sergeant van Greenen moving down - or north up King George Street to the intersection to try and prevent the marchers from coming down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You saw that they had their hands open and they were clearly indicating to the marchers "don't come down this way"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You saw that they were completely ignored by the marchers and your words were "pushed out of the way"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know that Sergeant van Greenen received an injury in that process?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, we found that out subsequently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it correct that prior to the main shooting incident you thought that the Police needed reinforcements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> There was a large group of people, yes.  One would have expected or needed greater assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> From where did the marchers come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> In King George from Noord Street in a norther direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> From north to south down King George?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw any marchers coming from De Villiers, from west to east towards King George Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No I didn't see anything like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You'll have to speak up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No I didn't see such people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I take it that you were particularly concerned to see what was happening in the intersection when Van Reenen and Van Greenen went up to stop the marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And at no stage, is it correct, did you see a tall, thin white man with long hair also attempting to stop the marchers from proceeding down towards Plein Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No I didn't see such a man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it possible Sergeant Potgieter, that you were not observing the marchers at all relevant times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, I did observe from time to time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, because there's no doubt that that man, his name is Mr von Eggedy, that that man was in the intersection at the critical time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I didn't see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And therefore I put it to you that you were not observing the marchers at the critical time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How many of the ANC guards at the corner there of Plein and King George did you see opening fire on the crowd?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I'm not entirely certain, but I would say about 10 to 15 people, I'm not certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Between 5 and 10?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Approximately 10, between 10 to 15, give or take a number of people, I'm not certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This person, Mr von Eggedy, says that the marchers were waving their weapons around and that they commenced coming down towards the corner of Plein and King George, or towards Plein Street, on full charge in the manner of carrying out an attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, they toyi-toyied, it was a sort of a jogging-walking motion, it wasn't a sprint that they ran, it was a sort of dance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Surely if you never even saw Mr von Eggedy, you can't dispute his evidence as to what was happening at the critical time Sergeant Potgieter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I didn't see Mr von Eggedy, I don't know what he saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr von Eggedy too was injured as the marcher overran him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I don't know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He is seen on TV with blood streaming down his face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I don't know, I only saw the photos during the inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it correct Sergeant Potgieter, that as the marchers - as you saw the marchers ignoring Sergeant van Reenen and Van Greenen, and as they began their attack, that you ran around the corner for your own safety?</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you ever run around the corner for your own safety?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me read to you what you say in paragraph 9 - I beg your pardon, paragraph 8 of your affidavit, it's at page 14 of Bundle E, you say, I will translate from Afrikaans to English</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a>"The Zulus then pushed Sergeant van Greenen and Van Reenen out of the road and moved closer to Shell House.  One of the people who stood there with me shouted that they were going to shoot - that he was going to shoot, which he did."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a>Well while we're at that point, I put it to you that that never happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> A shot was fired, I can't remember seeing a specific person firing that shot.  One shot was fired and then the gross shooting began.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> After - what I'm putting to you, I'm not putting to you that there wasn't shooting, I'm putting to you that he didn't shout "we're now going to shoot", and then shoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That happened.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a>MR BERGER:	"After he started shooting everyone was standing around him began shooting with shotguns", which you don't remember anymore, "pistols, and the person with the AK47 started firing with automatic fire."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You'll agree with me at least if I put it to you that there were no shotguns at that corner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I can't remember that.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a>MR BERGER:	"There was also a person on the balcony of Shell House who began to shoot at the Zulus with a shotgun."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I can't remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, I can tell you that there were four people on the balcony, and as far as shotguns are concerned, there were three people who fired shotguns on the balcony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Probably, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then this is the part that I wanted to read to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>"I saw" - and I'll read it in Afrikaans, "Ek het gesien dat van die Zulus val en het toe om die hoek beweeg vir veiligheid en het toe om die gebou beweeg om te sien of ek hulp aan die ander twee lede kan bied."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That was the during the inquest, I can't remember why safety was put down there.  Where I was standing there was no danger to me in my direction.  I just moved around the building to see whether I could offer assistance to the other two members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So when you say here that "I moved around the corner for safety", you cannot explain why that appears in the affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it because you are a little embarrassed, and really there's no reason to be embarrassed ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> To admit that things were actually frightening at that time, and that you did what any person would have done in your position, and that was to just get around the corner for safety.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, the Zulus were approximately 50 paces away from us.  On that corner there was no danger because I heard no shots from that side, or experienced any danger from that side in my direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see because if you had gone around the corner for safety, that would explain why you didn't see Mr von Eggedy; that would explain why you didn't see the man with the AK47 infront of Mr Diaz's shop;  that would explain why you didn't see any shots being fired at Shell House by the marchers, it would explain a whole lot of things if you would just explain what is in here in your affidavit that you went around the corner for safety.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Sir I didn't see any white man, I didn't see anybody running in front of the shop with an AK47, I didn't run away to seek safety.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also said in your evidence at the inquest that after you'd gone around the corner from King George to - along Plein to Klein and then up to De Villiers, and then round again to the corner of King George and De Villiers, that you spent three quarters of an hour on that corner, you recall that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And it was only after you'd spent that three quarters of an hour that you returned back to the corner of King George and Plein Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And we've dealt with this before, but I'm sure you know where I'm going ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Paragraph 9 of your statement, of your affidavit, page 15, this is now after you've gone around the corner "vir veiligheid" and gone around the building to see if you can help anybody, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>"...ek het later ongeveer 2 minute later terugbeweeg en het op die hoeke van Kleinstraat en Pleinstraat gaan staan."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a>Now you say that's not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I don't know about the two minutes later, this entire paragraph is not part of my memory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We'll come to the rest of the paragraph, but this statement, this affidavit you signed three days after the incident, so these events were very fresh in your mind at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, the reason I'm going to suggest to you why you've now put yourself three quarters of an hour at the corner of King George and De Villiers is because, as you say, the rest of this paragraph wouldn't make any sense, but let me read it to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a>"Daar het toe weer geweervuur vanuit die gebou regoor die Shell House gekom in die rigting waar die Zoeloes hulle bevind."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now that "gebou" would be the building above Nando's wouldn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>MR BERGER:	"Een van die persone wat nog op die hoeke van Pleinstraat en King Georgestraat geskiet het vir die Zoeloes het na die deure van die Shell House beweeg ...",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>this is now one of the ANC guards moves to the entrance of Shell House, the doors of Shell House, </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a>"... en met 'n haelgeweer na die gebou oorkant die Shell House waar die vuur vandaan kom, gevuur."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>This person then runs to the entrance of Shell House, takes a shotgun and shoots at someone shooting out of the Nando's building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I can't remember anything like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You've had plenty of time to think how this - since I asked you these questions at the inquest, to think how this could possibly have come into your affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I still don't have an answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Sorry Sergeant, just a few more questions.  Chairperson, I have no further questions to put to the witness, but my learned friend Miss Moroka has some questions, it relates to Lancet Hall, if she could just put these questions.  Thank you Sergeant Potgieter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOROKA:</span> Sergeant Potgieter, I want to ask you questions only in relation to the gate at the basement of Lancet Hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOROKA:</span> You do have your evidence there infront of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Ja, I've got it here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOROKA:</span> You were asked a question by Mr Berger at the inquest, you described how you forced open the door, is that correct?  You then indicated that it opened - that you broke the hydraulic mechanism.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOROKA:</span> And you were able - the door opened - I mean the gates opened only for a small space ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOROKA:</span> That enabled you to go through?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOROKA:</span> You then also further indicated that you don't know what happened to that gate thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, I don't know what happened to the gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOROKA:</span> You cannot say whether the gate - people were able to go in and out of - using their ...(indistinct) in and out of the gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No I wouldn't be able to tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Sergeant with reference to the scene as you found it when you moved around Shell House to look for your colleagues, do you still have any picture in your memory regarding where the injured and those who had died were positioned in relation to the block between De Villiers and Plein Streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> The only picture that I still have is that when I came around the corner there was a person with his back against the pillar and his ankle had been shot off, that's the picture that I have in my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Do you have any idea of what the furthest was that a deceased or injured person had been lying down that block in the direction of King George and De Villiers Streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Approximately 10 paces from the shop corners until King George Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> In a southern direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Do you have any impressions of whether or not you noticed any weapons, be it firearms or traditional weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> All that I saw was basically spears, corpses and shields, I didn't see any firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Sergeant, I just want to ensure at which specific point in time you left the scene around Shell House, could you assist us in that relation, you were standing behind the guards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I stood behind the guards ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You heard the shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Could you tell us how far you could see before you moved in an eastern direction down Plein Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> As soon as the shots began to subside, when it was no longer that intense shooting, I went around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> At that stage, was there still any gunfire when you started running?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I don't - I think so, it began to subside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've been questioned about whether you saw this gentleman called Mr von Eggedy at the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say that you didn't see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No I didn't see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What could be the reason why you didn't see him if he was in fact there, was it because there was too much of a crowd that blocked your view?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> There was a great number of people there and it would have been very easy for him to become lost among all those people if he was indeed there.  However I didn't see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there any other reason why you may not have seen him besides the possibility that the crowd was too big?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, not as I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it possible that your own attention was not focused all the time there, and you were concerned about your own safety?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I was concerned about my own safety when the man pressed the pistol against my chest, and that's the only time that I was really afraid for my own safety.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but that must have given you some idea as to what might happen to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes to me personally when the weapon was pressed against my chest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did that not possibly put you in a frame of mind where you were very concerned about your own safety as to what might happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> What could happen, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And your attention then was, if I may use the word "attention", was not on the scene all the time because you were a very worried man as to what might happen to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I was watching them all from where I was standing at the back, and the entire scene was infront of my eyes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you yourself armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And anybody who saw you would see that you had an arm - that you had a gun in your hand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, if they had seen me from affront.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And your colleagues, were they also armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Everybody could see that they had guns in their hands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes, they should have been able to see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If any of them used their guns, would you have known?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, not at Shell House, none of us fired any shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You wouldn't have known?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I would have known, I know that Sergeant van Reenen fired gas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you hear gunshots without knowing where they came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> In the beginning before the gross(?) shooting began, yes, from a western direction in Plein Street, but we didn't know specifically where the shots were being fired from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And later during that morning, did you not hear gunshots ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> At which point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Without knowing where they came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, just earlier that morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The time you went around Shell House to see whether you could help your friends, at that stage did you hear any gunshots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> I can't recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Just hold on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Just one other question, in the same sort of vein, that was the evidence of this person with the AK47 who was shooting outside the shop that Mr Da Silva spoke about ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I just want to know if there was any reason that you can offer us why you didn't see that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> No, I can't give you any reason, I didn't see it.  It was in the street, in King George Street.  There is no reason why I shouldn't have seen him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Okay, that was really the point I was more interested in, if there was - if it did happen, you surely would have seen it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> That's correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Sergeant I want to refer you specifically to paragraph 7 of your affidavit on page 14 of Exhibit E, the person with the AK47 to whom you are referring, you described his clothing in the final sentence of paragraph 7, you said he was wearing a white bulletproof jacket, do you confirm that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, as it would appear from the index of the list of witnesses to possibly give evidence on behalf of the objectors, on whose behalf I appear, I would like at this point in time to indicate as far witnesses no 3, 5 and 6 are concerned, that we do not intend calling these witnesses.  Mr Chairman may I just with regard to the motivation thereof, on the 24th of June we were requested to motivate the reason for witnesses being subpoenaed by the Committee, and in response thereto on the 25th of June we replied inter alia in paragraph 7 of the letter</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>"Although we requested a number of witnesses to be subpoenaed, we must stress that they all give a specific interpretation of what transpired.  They furthermore give a perspective from different vantage points and different stages of the incident.  We do not intend to duplicate any of the evidence and therefore anticipate that we would only call as many witnesses as would contribute to a considered decision by the Amnesty Committee."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a>	That is the position with regard to those three witnesses, hence us having decided not to call witnesses no 3, 5 and 6.  That leaves only two witnesses remaining on the list Mr Chair.  As far as Mr Ralph von Eggedy is concerned, we've been trying desperately to locate him, we've even asked Ms Patel to assist us, we've asked the Attorney-General's staff, the Investigating Officer of the Shell House inquest matter to assist us.  Up to this stage we are not able to locate Mr von Eggedy.  As you would no doubt see from the judgment of Mr Justice Nugent, it is an important witness.  We were trying to get hold of him, we tried all avenues but without success at this point in time.  He's therefore at this point in time not available as yet.  The last ...(intervention) </p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Wasn't there some kind of an agreement in regard to his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> With regard to the present proceedings Mr Justice Ngcobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I'm not sure that there was any specific agreement which - I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's not some kind of an understanding that his evidence at the inquest would go in by consent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...(inaudible) argument in which the evidence of Mr von Eggedy was praised and we said we accept that and second it, and Mr von Eggedy's evidence stands as whatever it says it says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> That leaves us with the last one, Mhlaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Indeed so, at the adjournment of the last proceedings I already indicated that this witness will be called.  I had by agreement on that date agreed with the witness to come and consult with me last week, he didn't arrive.  Somebody's trying to locate him, he's supposed to be residing at Room 7E Mansfield Hostel.  We haven't been able to locate him, I can't advance any reason for his non-attendance of the meeting last week.  I haven't been able to get in touch with him.  I've got two gentlemen actually trying to locate Mr Mhlaba.  His statement is contained in pages 37 and 38 of Exhibit E.  I would therefore request some indulgence to try and locate this witness.  He is indeed one of the marchers, Mr Chair, I've insisted on the gentlemen looking for him, to try and have Mr Mhlaba available tomorrow morning.  I cannot give any assurances, it is difficult to locate him, there's no way of contacting him but in person, and we're having difficulty to locate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Is he still residing at the address you just mentioned Mr Dorfling, to your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> That was the indication I had from the witness the last time when we adjourned here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR  TIPP :</span> Mr Chairman may we just raise the position of now Inspector van Reenen, Sergeant Gollach and Sergeant van Greenen.  Now obviously we've never consulted with any of those gentlemen.  Their evidence falls into a different category from that of Mr von Eggedy because there are matters in dispute in respect of their evidence, which is not the position of Mr von Eggedy.  Now it's not our wish to make work for the Committee or to delay the proceedings, all of those persons are present here Mr Chairman.  We don't want to call them as our witnesses, if they had to come we'd prefer to cross-examine them obviously, but if there is agreement between ourselves and our learned friends that one may have - make reference to what they have said and concessions that have been made by them for the purpose of argument before the Committee, then we would have no difficulty in leaving the position as it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) that are here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR  TIPP:</span> No Mr Chairman, sorry, I didn't make myself clear, in the course of their examination in the inquest, because again, they were fully examined by all sides.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR  TIPP:</span> So really on the same - in the equivalent of that of Mr von Eggedy, but with the understanding that unlike Mr von Eggedy, there are matters in dispute in respect of what they've said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Chair, if I may just indicate, there are definitely certain points in dispute as between the applicants and the objectors with regard to that evidence, there has been certain findings made in this regard by Mr Justice Newgent and you've rightly indicated, we're not re-visiting the Shell House inquest, so only in as far as the aspects are common cause, can this be regarded by this Committee.  Without this Committee having seen these witnesses and having had regard to the points in dispute, I think what we would be doing is to re-visit the Shell House inquest judgement instead of having our own decision or this Committee's own decision on it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well a great deal of our time has been taken up in visiting the inquest proceedings, isn't it.  Lengthy cross-examination of witnesses from both sides relating to what they said during the</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a>inquest and why their evidence in the inquest differed from what they're saying now and so on.  That's been carrying on on a substantial scale up to now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> ...(inaudible) that these witnesses may have given evidence at the inquest, and also to the extent that that court may have made certain findings often concerning their evidence and then as witnesses, what are we to do about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We're not concerned with the findings of the inquest court, but by consent, their evidence as it stands may form part of the record.  I think that's the suggestion that is being made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> But what about the findings of the inquest court, are we - in regard to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> No, without regard to the findings that that is simply embodied as part of the record of these proceedings, upon which we will then mount argument Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> But Mr Chair, I've got a difficulty with that proposition, it means we accept evidence without it being placed in the perspective of the totality of the evidence at the inquest court.  There's been a ...(intervention)</p>

<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> How are we to evaluate that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Chairman I appreciate that, it's really my learned friend's list that we're talking about, if he's not happy to do on the basis that the record is placed before the Committee.  If the Committee in turn is not happy to look at untested evidence, then we would with respect suggest that they be called as witnesses.  We understand ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The Committee does not know what evidence these people are going to give ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know, and for us to say we will call them at this stage might not be a particularly judicious decision, without know what it is all about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> May I come in here Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It is - counsel for the Committee, Mr Chairman, can call the witnesses.  We will confine ourselves once they have taken the oath, to ask and to confirm certain evidence that they gave at the inquest.  If that is not accepted, our learned friends will have an opportunity to cross-examine them, but there admissions in that evidence which we consider vital to the just decision of this case, and relying on our learned friends that they would call these witnesses, we came here to hear them and we would not like to loose the value of those concessions that they made at the inquest Mr Chairman, and we would urge that counsel for the Committee can call them, should they not ask them anything more that identify themselves, and give us an opportunity to ask a few questions of each one of them Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a>We've considered the request on whether questions should be put to you or not, and to Sergeant Gollach and Van Greunen.  The Committee has decided that since you've been subpoenaed to attend, and that you are here, that the applicants be afforded to put such questions to you as they wish so that we may have a full picture of what happened.  Do you understand?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now put such questions as are relevant to the purposes of this inquiry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Inspector van Reenen, we spent many hours in the inquest court, we are not going to spend that long here today.  I just want to remind you of a few aspects of the evidence that you gave in the course of the inquest and to ask you to confirm whether it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now first of all, you will remember that after you were assigned to go to Shell House and you got there at about 10h30, a little after that you heard some shots in the vicinity from somewhere down Plein Street in a westerly direction, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And an ANC guard in fact came up to you where the Police were and asked you please to intervene and go and deal with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's is correct, he asked me to accompany him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And it was clear to you and the other Policemen that the ANC in fact wanted the Police to take charge of the situation there and to ensure security?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes, on that day they asked us to go with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Do you agree with what I'm putting to you, that they wanted the Police to ensure security of the lives and property there at Shell House?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Inspector just deal with the question crisply please that I'm putting to you, was it clear to you that that man from the ANC wanted the Police to deal with it and to look after the security of the situation there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> He came to me and asked for my assistance, and I accompanied him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now a little after that you went off to investigate, Inspector you've heard - well let me come directly to the point, very shortly after that, you saw the - a large group of marchers of about 500-strong moving south down King George Street.  At that stage they were between Noord Street and De Villiers Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You and Sergeant van Greunen ran towards them to try to divert them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And do you agree with me that at that stage events were happening very fast and in an atmosphere of very high tension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You knew that Shell House was the national headquarters of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You knew that the march that day was part of the IFP campaign against the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And you knew on that day of the long-standing history of conflict between the ANC and the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And when you saw this large group of armed marchers approaching, the possibility of a violent confrontation between them and the ANC personnel was clear to your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> As you've seen in my affidavit, moments before the group there was already a shooting incident which had taken place on the corners of King George and Plein Streets.  I thought that there would be a confrontation between the two approaching groups, and that is why I went to the two groups to deter this kind of conflict.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And Inspector, you'll recall I think during the course of the inquest proceedings that you were shown certain photographic material, and from your own observations at the time, you will remember that the portion of King George Street between De Villiers Street and Plein Street was one that had a number of concrete barricades across it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> On the Plein Street side those concrete barricades ran right across King George Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And on the De Villiers Street side a couple had been moved aside to allow a car in and out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> But for the rest it was also barricaded, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And also of course we know that King George Street as one moves south, it doesn't proceed, it runs directly into buildings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct, in Small Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You as at 1994, you were a Policeman with 8 years experience and had some experience with crowd control and crowd movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And I think you'll agree with me that of all the streets in the vicinity there, that block of King George Street between De Villiers Street and Plein Street, was the most unsuitable for the movement of a large number of marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes I would say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well De Villiers Street was wider and open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Wanderers Street was wider, Klein Street was wider, yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And open, yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a>NO AUDIBLE ANSWER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> If you nod, we won't ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes that's correct, I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now Inspector, we've been busy with the application here for - over some days, I want with your assistance, objectively to try to convey to the Committee what the state of mind was of yourself at that time, and through that to try to convey in slightly more detail as to the atmosphere at that time, are you with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes I understand you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Good.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Now your state of mind as you ran up King George Street in the direction of the marchers, you realised, you saw, and your evidence was that the sight of that large on-coming group of armed people was a sight to induce fear, particularly for anybody who might consider it his duty to try to stop them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> I wouldn't put it in that light, the group came down King George Street, they were toyi-toying.  As I've already said, I had managed a number of marchers before, and I wouldn't say that I was afraid of them, that's why I approach them, in order to deter them, because in previous marches one would usually go to the Induna, they would usually listen to you and they would do what you asked them to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well that's what would normally happen with a crowd control, the position on this day in fact was different, there was no Induna that you could see, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> I moved to the group, I didn't see any other group as such, I moved to that group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Just deal with the question, you didn't see any Induna to whom you could have - whom you could approach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> No I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And also there were no Policemen moving with the group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now Inspector van Reenen, I want to remind you of your evidence, we can go through the record if necessary, but at the stage that you were at the front of the group, you then feared for your own safety, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's, when they had already crossed De Villiers Street and they didn't want to concede to my appeal to move down De Villiers Street, I moved right in an eastern direction and I was bumped out of the way, myself and Sergeant van Greunen, by the crowd.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You used in the inquest frequently the phrase "hulle het jou uit die pad uit gestamp", correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And now at that stage it was clear that this was a different kind of march from ones that you dealt with previously, two uniformed Policemen openly carrying weapons had gone to them, with arms outstretched, calling on them to turn away and clearly indicating that should turn away, and they ignored you, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now at that stage, let's look at your state of mind, at that stage did you fear for your own safety?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> I knew firstly that I was on the corners of King George and Plein Streets where shooting had already taken place moments before.  It was an ANC building, here was an IFP march approaching the building, there would possibly be further confrontation and I was caught between the two parties, and I moved right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well let me just read to you a few lines from you evidence at the inquest.  Mr Chairman I begin at 2094, at line 24.  I asked you the following question, I said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a>"I'm not discussing possibilities with you, I want you to tell us what your state of mind was at that instant...", we're talking now about the stage that they were clearly going to ignore you, "and let me ...", the question goes on, "... let me ask you again and you can answer, did you fear for your safety - or let me stop there, did you fear for your safety?" ---  and your answer "Ja, toe hulle oor die straat beweeg en ek gesien het ek kan die mense nie keer nie, toe gaan ek na die kant toe"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a>then over the page, Mr Chairman, 2095, the Court understood it, the Court said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a>"Dan is die antwoord ja.", ---  and you said "Ja, in daardie opsig, ek moes wegkom voor die groep want anders sou die groep my ook moontlik beseer het.  Indien wel, toe beweeg ek weg voor die groep."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And then the Court went on in the next line, said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a>"So die antwoord is ja ...", did you fear for your own safety, "...die antwoord is ja, is dit so?  ---  Van die groep se kant af, ja.  Hulle wou nie afgedraai het nie en ek wou nie voor hulle bly nie."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a>So from the on-coming group's side you feared for your own safety at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct, that's exactly what I've said, after they had already crossed the street and they didn't want to concede ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> That's the stage I'm now talking about, how things developed there when they clearly ignored the Police instructions to turn away.  And on that same page, the very next lines Mr Chairman, just for the record, at lines 11 to 13 on page 2095, I then asked you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a>"Did you think then Inspector, that if you try to stand your ground, that you would be overrun and physically harmed by this oncoming group?"  ---  And your answer was simply "Ja."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And at page 2096, Mr Chairman, lines 18 to 20, in that context I specifically asked you, the previous question was the sight of this group proceeding onwards despite the efforts of the Police to divert them, that was the context, and then I asked you specifically at line 18"</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a>"For anyone in their path, was it not a sight to induce fear?"  ---  And your answer:  "Ja, die persoon wat hulle wil keer, natuurlik vir daardie persoon."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a>Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And you'll remember, just to put it in the perspective of the perceptions of the ANC people who were on duty to protect the building and the lives of those in it, I asked you whether you could point to any facts that would suggest that their perception that what was happening was an attack, and you said you could point to no facts to suggest that that perception would be wrong, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You confirm it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now Inspector, one of the important elements playing a role in that situation, from the point of anybody like yourself who was involved in it, was a question of time, and again I'm not going to waste time, it's not intended to be a pun, I just want to get directly to the point.  You'll remember at one stage I asked you "did it ever occur to you to use teargas to try to keep them away", and your answer was in the context of your were already close to the group and it was no longer possible to do that.  Do you remember that bit of evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And you were asked at page - at 2098 some questions by the Court, the previous question beginning at line 19 Mr Chairman</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a>"Hoekom het u nie omgedraai en in King George Straat terugbeweeg en aanhou om die groep te probeer keer?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a>In other words why didn't you just continue your efforts to stop them and move all the way down King George?</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a>You answer:  "As ek dit so moet vat, indien daar gevuur sou gewees het sou ek in die middel gewees het voor die groep en voor die mense wat op die hoeke staan van King George en Pleinstraat."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> So you're saying, from your point of view at that stage, you were now between two possible perils, the oncoming group which might harm you, and the ANC who might harm you if in fact they opened fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And the Court then went on in the next question</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a>"Is dit nou wat u gedink het op daardie stadium, as ek nou voor hierdie groep aangaan, miskien gaan ek geskiet word?"  ---  and your answer was, I'm going to read it: "Alles gebeur so vinnig op daardie stadium, daar gaan so baie deur 'n mens, jy moet altyd alles voorsien, jy het 'n paar sekondes om te dink wat moet jy doen, waarnatoe moet jy gaan, wat moet jy presies doen in daardie spesifieke tyd."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And does that still in your mind correctly reflect the pressure that was on you at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> When - I think when you speak here about a few seconds, "'n paar sekondes", you literally meant that, it was just a few seconds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And extrapolating Inspector, the ANC personnel would have been in substantially the same situation as you, they would also have had literally at that stage as that group kept coming past - ignoring you, kept coming on into King George Street, they also had literally a few seconds in which to assess the situation and to react.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> They had more time than I did because they were further away from the group than I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> It's a very short block that, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Approximately 50 - 60 paces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And they were already into King George Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> They were with me approximately 10 to 15 paces into it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Roughly speaking, another 40 metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And if they moved fast, it would literally be a matter of seconds before they were on top of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> But they had more time that I did at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> We're not talking about whether you only had 3 seconds and they might have had 7 or 8 seconds, I'm just putting to you that literally they also only had a few seconds in which to assess and deal with the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> I want to also very briefly Mr Chairman, to underline the sense of urgency, the sense of pressure, and the sense of peril that attended that situation, with a few references to one or two aspects of the evidence.  You follow what I'm doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now it's common cause Inspector - well let me put the context of it first, my apologies Mr Chairman.  Your evidence was emphatic at the inquest, you saw a group coming down King George Street and you say there was not a group at all in De Villiers Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now I'm putting to you that it's common cause that there was in fact a very large group, numbering in the region of 500, which at the same time as the one came down King George, moving south, had come along De Villiers Street moving east to the very same intersection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That is not so.  We wouldn't have pointed the group into the direction of De Villiers Street, because there was another group coming up and they would have collided.  There was no group coming up De Villiers Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> That's your recollection of it Inspector, but I'm just putting to you that it's common cause that there was this group, and the fact that you didn't see it and believed that you could in fact direct a large group in that direction, illustrates again how difficult it was for anybody to form a clear sense of what was happening, even on so large a scale.  Would you accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> No I would not agree because I looked down De Villiers Street, and there was no group approaching.  At that stage no incident had occurred on those corners.  The group was still moving forward, I went to them, De Villiers Street was open, and I did not show them down De Villiers Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> By the same token, and along the same vein, it's common cause that in that very intersection, literally in the moments before the shooting began, there was Mr von Eggedy, the one you've heard so much about and you've heard references again to him today while you were listening to the evidence.  And I believe Inspector, that you've seem perhaps a video of him or at least photographs of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You haven't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> No I haven't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well it's common cause that in the intersection immediately before the shooting there was this tall gentleman with strikingly long hair circling the intersection and calling on the marchers to stop.  Now you didn't see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Chairperson, if you could just precisely indicate to me where this person was in the intersection, was he already in King George Street after the intersection, or was he himself in the intersection where I was, because if they say that he was in the intersection, then I don't agree with that because no other person was with me in the intersection, it was only me and Sergeant van Green in the intersection.  If it's possibly after the intersection in King George Street, it could be, but that had to be after the intersection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well Inspector, I'm going to do the next best thing to showing you a video of what happened, because the only pictorial depiction that we have is one prepared by Mr von Eggedy himself, entirely independently, Mr Chairman in Bundle B at page 112.  Mr Chairman I think it's not necessary for the Committee to turn it up, but it's the sketch portion of Mr von Eggedy's very first statement.  You will see there Inspector where Mr von Eggedy puts himself, in the intersection, circling in it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> I don't agree with this evidence.  I don't agree, he was not in the middle where he says that he was, because I moved from the northern side into King George Street,  I re-iterated back down the street in an eastern direction and there no person behind or in front of me while I was deterring the marchers into De Villiers Street.  He could not have been there at any point as he alleges, according to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well let me then put to you for your comment, the evidence of your colleague, Sergeant van Greunen.  You're doubtless aware that Sergeant van Greunen testified at the inquest that what he saw was a group of about 500, coming from De Villiers Street and turning into that part of King George Street next to Shell House.  And to put it in slightly more detail, Sergeant van Greunen says that when you and he ran up to stop the crowd, they had already turned into King George Street, in other words they were already through the intersection.  Now that was your colleague Sergeant van Greunen who ran right up next to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's not correct, that is not what happened on that day.  As I've already said, there was one group moving down King George Street in a southern direction, that is the only group which I observed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Immediately after the events you went off to find Sergeant van Greunen, he'd run off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> I take it that he would have reported to you then that he'd been injured by one of the marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> With a sharp instrument like a spear or an assegai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> That was in the course of the efforts by you and he to divert or stop the marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Inspector, just one or two concluding aspects I hope, at the inquest at one point you gave evidence that you were not able to give a definite "yes" or a definite "no" as to whether or not there was a reason for the ANC guards to have opened fire, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And that's ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> ...(inaudible) as to where the first shots came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> So I think you will be able to confirm that once the crowd had pushed its way past you at whatever speed, it entered into that part of King George Street next to Shell House and again within a few seconds shooting broke out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> That the shooting was of a short duration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> We've heard estimates in the region of 10/12 seconds, would that correspond with your assessment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes, that would be approximately correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And whilst the shooting was still going on, marchers were, had turned and were trying to get away, did you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> After the shooting had taken place the marchers moved down De Villiers Street in a western direction, and some of the marchers moved back to the corners.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Inspector you're not answering the question that I put to you, I just want to know whether you were in fact in a position to observe this, that whilst the shooting was still proceeding, marchers were running back, trying to get away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> I didn't see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You didn't notice that.  Inspector, whilst there was shooting, on your version you were still in De Villiers Street, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> After the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> No, sorry, whilst the shooting was still continuing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct, I was in De Villiers Street towards the east.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Did you see or notice at all that there was firing from the side of the marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> No I didn't notice anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Could you from what you heard, were you able to tell whether or not such shots were fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> No I couldn't say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You couldn't say.  Just for - I'll leave it at that Mr Chairman.  Again in the spirit that this is not a trial, I'm not going to begin to put versions in respect of matters.  Thank you for the opportunity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR TIPP</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr van Reenen I would want your indulgence because I want to form a picture in my mind as to how the group was armed, and you of all the witnesses we've heard were very much close to this group.  Would you just take a second of your time to describe to us the kinds of weapons that you saw amongst the group of marchers, because you were very close to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> All that I saw was knobkierries, assegais, shields, sticks, that's all that I noticed among the group as such which was before me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are you able to say whether there were any firearms amongst the group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> I saw no firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And when you say the group was toyi-toying, are you referring to a chant when you say they were toyi-toying as you approached them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> They didn't storm, they moved forward slowly as they usually would.  They'd moved forward and backward, forward and backward, that is how the movement took place.  They didn't storm at all, not at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Were you able to identify any person who would have appeared to you to have been leading the marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> No I didn't see anybody at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are you able to say whether the group was marching in a very organized manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct, they appeared as such.  When they moved down King George Street from north to south, they appeared like that, they appeared to be very ordered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And would you say the order disappeared immediately after you were bumped out by them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Well then I couldn't see what they were doing any longer at stage because I had given way and they had moved ahead.  I couldn't tell you whether or not they were still toyi-toying or whether they stormed, I simply got out of the way in front of them.  After they had crossed the intersection it is very difficult for me to say exactly how they had proceeded, because I had been pushed out of the way and I was already in De Villiers Street at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You were so induced by fear after that incident that you were unable to observe what the marchers did after you were bumped out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You were asked earlier by Mr Tip whether you could see if the marchers were running away from being shot at while the shooting was happening, and you said you didn't see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you see whether they were running forward while the shooting was on the go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> No I couldn't see anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You couldn't see anything at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> No, when I moved into De Villiers Street I couldn't see whether or not they were storming or whether they were still moving forward as they had.  They had already crossed the intersection, they had gone into King George Street and over De Villiers Street.  I can't tell you whether or not they ran forward or ran backwards or whether they were toyi-toyi'ing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see because my understanding is that there was a big group of people and they pushed past you.  Now I think you mentioned a figure of roundabout 500-odd people, more than that, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> For a group of that size to carry on moving into King George would have quite some time, for them to move into King George and for the end of that group to be finished, you with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Correct, I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You retreat into De Villiers Street, but you can still see the group moving down King George Street surely, at that point?  In other words even the middle or the back of that group must have still been visible to you going into King George Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> After the intersection I didn't look at them again, I moved to the side into De Villiers Street, I can't tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you didn't turn around and observe the group at all after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> No I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You did say that your friend or your companion Greunen had been injured and you think, you said, he'd been injured with a spear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't see the actual injury being inflicted, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> No I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And at that time you were armed I take it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And Greunen was armed as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the possibility exists that he was stabbed at a time when he had a gun in his hand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> It's possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry just one last thing, did it ever occur to you at any point to fire your own firearm as a warning shot to try and cause this group to disperse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> I didn't think of it at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, I would likewise also like to point out just two extracts from the record and just ask the witness for his response.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a>	Inspector, firstly I want to refer to the position of deceased and injured after the shooting incident.  On page 205 of the record I will read the following extraction of your evidence, line 10, could you just find it, 205, line 10.  Do you have it before you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> It reads</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a>"Well I's sought shelter on the eastern side in de Villiers Street itself.  If you take de Villiers Street, that would have been in de Villiers Street on the southern tip because that's where I stood.  The shooting had finished.  I noticed that there were plus minus 20 people who were standing on the corner of King George, they were lying on the corner of King George Street, to the west"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a>With reference to that evidence could assist the Committee regarding exactly where the people would be lying, how far into King George Street, was it on the intersection, where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> It was in King George Street itself.  King George Street from north to south and it was in King George Street already past De Villiers Street, approximately 10 to 15 paces into King George Street already.  The people lay on the western side in King George Street itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Is it correct to say that on the other side of Shell House, on the pavement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> One of the Honourable Committee members asked you what firearms or whether you had seen any firearms amongst the crowd, you answered in the negative to that.  I'd like to refer you to page 2056 of the record when it was asked to you whether or not you heard anybody fire shots from within the crowd.  Could you please turn to page 2056, line 12.  There advocate Matzke asked you about this specific aspect</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a>"When you encountered the group on St George and de Villiers Street, did you hear any gunfire from the group of Zulus"  ---  "No, I didn't"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a>Do you stand with that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes that's correct, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Is it correct to say that until the moment that you were bumped out of the way you heard no gunfire, and you were right next to the march?  Up until that moment you heard no gunfire coming from the marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Finally, you were asked about the injury of Sergeant van Greunen, who would have reported to you that he had been injured with some sort of short object, what was the nature of the injury?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> I don't know on which side of his shoulder it was, it was on the back of his shoulder, there was a cut.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Did he receive any stitches or medical treatment for that injury?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> As far as I know it wasn't very serious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> It would appear then that the person who had injured him had probably been behind him when he was injured, would you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> As you sit here today Inspector, you have already indicated this in the inquest, that as far as you could see, and perhaps I could refer you to the page 2056, line 22 where the question was put to whether you could find any reason why shots were fired, your answer was</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a>"no I can't tell you."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Is that still your evidence, as you sit here today could you find no reason within your own mind why shots were fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DORFLING</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairman, I've just got a couple of questions to raise with the witness with your leave, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a>	Mr van Reenen, just regarding the shooting incident, if you'll refer back to page 2055 before line 10, the piece after that you relate how you arrived there and then you say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a>"Moments thereafter shots were fired"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a>Let's just place that in perspective, you said that you and Van Greunen were bumped out of the way:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a>"Van Greunen went west and I went east, moments after that shots were fired"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a>So there moments after you had been bumped out of the way in a western direction, the shots went off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Could I then also refer you to page 2107, at the top of the page from line 1</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a>"What did you see when the shots were fired for the first time"?  ---  When I heard the shots I saw how the group of people on the western side began to fall"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a>Therefore moments after you had been bumped out of the way, the shots went off and when the shots went off you saw the people fall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> In conjunction with my learned friend's question, inasfar as it was a shooting incident from within the group, you also confirm at other places such as page 2104 that there was no shooting from within the group, that is from line 10 and further, that is in relation to my learned friend Mr Tip's questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> As far as you know, you never heard any shots being fired from within the group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> And then, in conclusion, on that very same page there has been evidence given by the ANC guards, and it was also put to you that you indeed after you had tried to stop the group and they wouldn't give in to your appeal, you did not move away from the group but you actually ran back in the direction of the ANC, in fact you ran until you joined the ANC guards who were on the corner of King George's Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That is a false statement, van Greunen and I never ran back to Plein Street on the corner of King George Street, we moved down De Villiers Street, we never ran back to King George Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Constable van Greunen was with the group who had been shot where the people later fell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN REENEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No further questions for the witness thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRETORIUS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a>WITNESS IS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Gollach would you please come forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> (Duly sworn in, states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson, it's me this time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a>	Sergeant Gollach, I want to take you very briefly to the first incident in Plein Street when there was a shooting down from the direction of Wanderers, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The shots came from the direction of Wanderers Street and an ANC guard came to you and said that they were being shot at, the ANC guards were being shot at and as a result of that you went west down Plein Street in the direction of Wanderers Street to investigate, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You will also recall that after you had crossed Plein Street, I beg your pardon, King George Street, you said that you heard 2 to 3 shots from a handgun which was behind you, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Not a shotgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you'll also recall that you were very frightened at that time, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> I was rather nervous, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you will recall what was put to you, I put it to you in fact, during the inquest.  I had Mr Eddie Khumalo sitting next to me and he pointed out that you were the young policeman who had taken cover in Plein Street between King George and De Villiers and that you appeared to be very frightened and in fact you were shaking, and Mr Khumalo in fact came to assist you and to take you out of that dangerous situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> No, at that stage all of us, myself, Skippers, Potgieter and Van Reenen had crossed the intersection.  I can't remember that he took me out of there, we all moved back to the intersection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you'll recall at the inquest you gave various answers to that question, but the very first answer that you gave when I put it to you that Mr Khumalo said that he in fact came and took you out of that dangerous situation, you said that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a>"It is possible that Mr Khumalo came to assist me"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a>Did you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> Is that in the record, if it is could you please refer me to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Page 4214 and 4215 of the record.  At the top of page 4214, well if I can just go to the bottom of 4213, I asked you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a>"You felt that you were in the middle of a dangerous situation, is that right?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a>You answer:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a>"Ja."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a>Question: </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a>"You were nervous, correct?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a>		---  "That's correct".</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a>"You were shaking, were you not?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a>Answer:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a>"I can't recall"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a>Then I said to you:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a>"Mr Khumalo over here, I asked him to come to Court today to see if you are one of the two people that he spoke about who was shivering in Plein Street, nervous and unsure what to do, and he tells me that you are one of them."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a>And your answer:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a>"If it is as he says it is, it may be so.  That is not how I experienced it.  I would say that one was afraid, one knew where the shots were coming from but I wouldn't say that I was shaking"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a>Question:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a>"And at that - there were two of you, two young Policemen and that he feared for your safety, that he came and took you out of that situation and told you Commanding Officer not to send young plicemen into such a dangerous situation."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a>		--- "That I can't recall, no"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a>And then after that the Court asked you certain questions and you said you couldn't remember.  Then at 4215 when I said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a>"Sergeant is it possible that Mr Khumalo in fact did come and take you and a colleague of yours out of that dangerous situation?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a>You said:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a>"Ek kan nie onthou nie, ek kan nie se dit is nie moontlik nie.  Ek kan nie onthou dan enigiemand - volgens my het ons self terugbeweeg.  Ek sal nie so se nie, nee."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a>And then further on you say it wasn't possible;  and then further on say it was possible, but the point that I'm putting to you is that when I first asked you, you said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a>"Yes, it's possible"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> It could have been, but I don't think that's what happened, we all moved back.  It could have happened, but that's not how I remember it subsequently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> With the greatest respect Mr Chair, I think my learned friend should just read on a few more lines where the witness's evidence is quite clear at page 4215, at line 10</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a>"Sergeant is it possible that Mr Khumalo in fact did come to take you and a colleague of yours out of that dangerous situation.  ---  Ek kan nie onthou nie, ek kan nie se dit is nie moontlik nie, ek kan nie onthou dat enigiemand - volgens my het ons self terugbeweeg.  Ek sal nie so se nie, nee."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a>And then by Court:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a>"Maar wat is daardie antwoord?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a>And the answer:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a>"No."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a>That was the answer given by the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, I said to the witness that he gave both answers and the first answer that he gave was the one that it is possible, and he's just confirmed now it is possible, but that's not the way he recalls it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a>	In that first incident, Sergeant Gollach, is it correct, this is the Wanderers Street incident, is it correct that the ANC guards that you saw were on street level, you didn't see any guards on the balcony level?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> That's correct, I didn't see anybody up there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then after that incident you moved back to the corner of Plein and King George?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you standing with Sergeant Potgieter at that corner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> Yes, it was me and Sergeant Potgieter, and I think Sergeant Skippers as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you're saying there were three policemen on that corner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> Yes, I can remember seeing Sergeant Skippers there as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, there was Potgieter, himself and Skippers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> No Chairperson, Potgieter, Skippers and me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you - did you see Sergeant van Reenen and van Greunen moving up King George Street towards the marchers in De Villiers Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also saw Sergeant van Reenen and Van Greunen trying to keep the marchers away, from coming down towards where you were standing, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also saw that the marchers paid absolutely no heed, and knocked Van Reenen and Van Greunen out of the way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> I didn't physically see him being bumped out of the way, I just saw the group continuing with their movement ahead, through Van Greunen and Van Reenen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What you saw is Van Reenen and Van Greunen being engulfed by the crowd?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> That's correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw Mr von Eggedy, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> Not from where I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And at that time you were standing amongst the ANC guards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In fact you evidence was that you were right inbetween the guards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> Among the guards, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You had a clear view of Van Reenen and Van Greunen running up the street and what was happening to them at the intersection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> Up until that point, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And yet you never saw Von Eggedy at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> I didn't see him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it correct that at the critical time you were actually not on that corner Sergeant Gollach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> At that stage I was on the corner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you on that corner when the guards on that corner opened fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> When the ANC security guard with the AK47 began to shoot I moved to the entrance because I saw that more guards were coming out, and I told people to move back because of the guards that were coming out.  I was there just as the shooting began, just as the guard began shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Your colleague Constable Skippers saw one of the marchers coming down from De Villiers Street towards Plein in King George with an AK47, you didn't see that either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> No, I didn't see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> According to your evidence the ANC guard with the AK47 fired, as you put it, a "sarsie skote".  You said maybe 5 or a few more shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> It was only a few shots which he fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You then went round the corner towards the entrance of Shell House;  you went to look for Major Els, you couldn't find him;  you then went up Klein Street, you came up again west in De Villiers Street to the corner of King George and De Villiers, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> That's correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw Sergeant van Reenen in De Villiers Street, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> Sergeant van Reenen in De Villiers Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> When I came back on the other side, Sergeant Skippers, he was in De Villiers Street.  I didn't see Inspector van Reenen in De Villiers Street, I didn't notice him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were watching the crowd at the time that the ANC guards opened fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> I was chatting to the ANC guards all the time, then I saw the march move up through Van Reenen and Van Greunen.  That's the last time I saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So are you saying that if they had attacked, and I can give you the words of Mr von Eggedy, if they had been brandishing their weapons on full charge in the manner of an attack, are you saying you might not have seen that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> At that stage I didn't see it like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Sergeant, I'm done.  Thank you Sergeant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Sergeant, I don't know whether you actually understood the last question, would you have been in a position to have seen if the crowd was on full charge from where you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> At that stage they weren't storming.  When they moved past Van Reenen and Van Greunen, that was the last time that I saw them, they weren't storming, they had just gone through the intersection, they weren't storming, they didn't come running, they were simply toyi-toying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Sorry Chairperson, if I may just ask two more questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm sorry Sergeant Gollach.  When you were standing at that corner, you never saw or heard any shot strike the window of the shop a few metres in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> No I didn't experience it that way while I was standing there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw anybody fire any shots into the underside of the parapet on the corner of King George and Plein Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> No, I also didn't experience it in that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you never saw any of the ANC guards fire warning shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Either into the air or into the underside of the parapet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw it?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOLLACH:</span> I can't say with certainty where they were at that stage.  I can't say at which stage that took place, I can't even recall.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Sergeant van Greunen, you've been listening to the evidence and you've seen what the process is.  We just want to highlight one or two aspects of what happened at Shell House insofar as it concerns you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And if you want to answer in Afrikaans, you've heard the ruling, you're very free and welcome to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> No it's not a problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Whatever suits you.  Sergeant, you'd been at Shell House throughout the morning, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And was there at any time throughout your presence as a policeman there, any discussion as to what the police were to do in the event of a confrontation-situation arising?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> None at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You were not briefed and you were not given any orders by your Commanding Officer, Major Els?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> None at all, we were just told we're working in special digits that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> That's all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And we know that at 10h30 the Regional Commissioner, General Calitz, gave an order as a matter of priority that Shell House was to be cleared, you heard nothing about such order and you saw nothing being done to give effect to it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> None at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now Sergeant, at about 10h45, the Committee has already heard the evidence, I'm just going through it to put you in context, there were some shots down from the area roughly of Wanderers Street, apparently from some marchers and a number of policemen went off in that direction to investigate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> I don't know about the policemen who went to investigate about a shooting in Wanderers Street at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well let - I'm not going to waste time on it, but you gave evidence at the inquest that at about 10h45 you heard a few shots and you moved west to the corner of King George and Plein Street, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And roundabout 11h00 shortly before the main shooting, the shooting that we're all concerned with, you heard other shots there in the vicinity of Shell House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And your state of mind at that time, one couldn't tell precisely where they were coming from or what was happening, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And you yourself were very tense and nervous?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And that is before the large group of marchers that you saw even came into your sight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Generally Sergeant, the atmosphere there was one of tension and a sense of emminant peril, would you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And that that is something that the ANC personnel there would also have shared from your observation there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct, we were all tense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now Sergeant, you've of course heard already me raise with Inspector van Reenen the apparently strange circumstance that two police officers, you and now Inspector van Reenen ran up to stop the crowd, you saw a group of 500 coming from De Villiers Street and round the corner into King George, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And in fact you gave evidence at the inqest that you'd looked up towards up King George Street in the direction of Noord Street and you hadn't seen a large group from there at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And we know in fact that there was one group from De Villiers Street and another from King George Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now all that I'm putting to you is that the strange circumstance of so large a difference in observation in respect of groups of 500 is to be accounted for, because the events happened so fast and because they were really very frightening from beginning to end, would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> I would agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You yourself, as you were moving up with then Sergeant van Reenen to try to stop the group from coming on, you felt afraid for your own safety?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> You could say I was cautious and I was afraid, although it was part of the duty to try and stop the conflict before it happens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> It's not for me to compliment you, but it must have been a very difficult situation for any policeman, and an act of courage to move in that direction at all, but be that as it may, I'm just going to refer you to your evidence, I can read it if necessary, if you don't recall it Sergeant, you just say so, but you gave evidence that as you approached the marchers you felt that you were in danger, you didn't know how the Zulus would react to you approaching them and you didn't know what was going to happen there.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And also it was a dangerous situation because you had, as you put it, the Zulus with traditional weapons on the one side and the ANC with firearms on the other side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And the potential for conflict was clear to you at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's also correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Also at the time, is it correct that the possibility had crossed your mind that these marchers might in fact try to press their way into Shell House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> At that stage I didn't really think about that at that time, all I thought about was trying to get the people to move in a different direction other than coming up in King George Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Perhaps you can just explain one, a couple of lines from your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a>	Mr Chairman at page 1986, line 13 to 17.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a>	You have your record there Sergeant, I think.  I'll just read it to you.  You'd given reasons why you at one stage of your evidence had said that you could see no reason why there had been shooting on the marchers, and one of them was that the building, Shell House, had according to you, correctly or not is unimportant now, but you had believed that it had bulletproof doors, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And I then asked you at line 13 on that page</p>

<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now we already know Sergeant that you, as did Inspector van Reenen, both of you were in uniform as you approached the on-coming marchers, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Police uniform, a regulation blue uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And you were both openly carrying arms, in fact you were carrying a shotgun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And it was perfectly visible to people as you approached them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> It was also absolutely clear to them that you police officers wanted them not to proceed further south down King George Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Notwithstanding that, you were knocked out of the way by them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And in the course of that you were injured by a spear or an assegaai, fortunately not a serious injury?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> But nevertheless Sergeant, it was an injury caused by someone who was aggessively pushing you out of the way, so that he and his fellow, the fellows in the group could move on to where they wanted to go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> The general bearing of that group, the one that gave you cause for alarm about your safety, was one of aggressiveness, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> At first it didn't seem as aggressive.  I guess when we tried to stop them, they probably just wanted to show us, listen we're gonna carry on up the street, and that's it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well at that moment, that's the critical moment really, at that stage was it clear to you that their conduct was in fact aggressive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> Ja, I felt that way, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Yes.  And when you were knocked to one side you ended up with your back against the burglar-bars of the window of the Woburn Pharmacy, which is on the corner of King George and De Villiers Street opposite Shell House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And while you were there, members of this crowd were still knocking you aside as they moved past you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> That was also your evidence.  And like Inspector van Reenen, you regularly in your evidence in the inquest used the phrase</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a>"uit die pad uit gestamp"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And they had in fact proceeded, the front of the group in your estimation at the time, had proceeded some 5 or 10 metres past the pharmacy when shooting broke out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Is it also correct, and you gave a graphic description Sergeant, that members of this crowd then were trying to flee, some were falling, whether they had been struck by gunfire or were simply taking cover, you did not know but while that was happening gunfire continued.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And you, to get out of the scene of that conflict, then ran around the corner into De Villiers Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That is also correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Chairman, just one moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a>	Just in conclusion Sergeant, and again if necessary I can refer you to passages, if you're not certain then I'll do so with pleasure, but you'll remember that in the course of the inquest you were asked whether you could say positively where the first shots came from.  At some points in your evidence you said that you couldn't say where the first shots came from;  at other points in your evidence you said they came from your right-hand side, from the direction of the ANC.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And as you sit there today, would it be fair to say that you really, you are not confidently able to state under oath where those first shots came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That's also correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And you'll remember also Sergeant, although there's nothing in your statement to this effect, in fact nothing about Shell House really at all, at one stage you said that you had heard one of the ANC people on the corner say something like the following "let's kill some Zulus, they are going to attack Shell House", do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And you also remember that at other points in your evidence you accepted that perhaps it hadn't happened at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> It's ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Would you like me to refer you it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> Yes please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Yes, I'll do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a>	Mr Chairman at page 1990, just to put it in context Mr Chairman, the Committee will see that at page 1989 I raised in cross-examination the question of this statement, I'm not going to read it.  At page 1990, line 1 the Court asked:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a>"Wel is u seker dit het gebeur, of maak u miskien 'n fout, want soos ek verstaan, sekere van daardie persone wat daar was, vennaam ANC lede, hulle gaan se dit het nie gebeur nie, niemand het dit gese nie.  Is u seker, of is u nie seker nie, maak u 'n fout?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a>And your answer:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a>"Ek weet nie of die ander Polisiemanne wat saam met my daar was die opmerkings gehoor het en dit in hulle verklarings geskryf het nie, dan se ek maar eerder ek is nie seker daar nie."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a>Right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> At there are a few other, at line 12 you said "so se maar liewer ek is nie seker nie."  At line, approximately 16, you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1713"><a name="pos1713"></a>"goed, ek is dan nie seker nie."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1714"><a name="pos1714"></a>At line 19 you said:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1715"><a name="pos1715"></a>"Ek sal se ek kan dit onthou"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1716"><a name="pos1716"></a>You went back to saying "well I can remember it."  And then at line 27 I asked you, I pointed out:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1717"><a name="pos1717"></a>"Daar's geen melding van so 'n opmerking in u verklaring nie"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1718"><a name="pos1718"></a>And then your answer was:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1719"><a name="pos1719"></a>"Dan dra ek nie kennis nie."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1720"><a name="pos1720"></a>And there are one or two other such references.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1721"><a name="pos1721"></a>	Again, as you sit there Sergeant, we're not running a trial, as you sit there, are you confidently able to state under oath that you definitely heard such a remark, or are you not sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1722"><a name="pos1722"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> I'm not sure, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1723"><a name="pos1723"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR TIPP</p>
<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Where would you have obtained the information regarding those remarks from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Page 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Did you hear those remarks or didn't you hear them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> I'd say no, I didn't hear those remarks, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He says that he didn't hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairman, just one or two aspects.  Mr van Greunen did you ever see a firearm amongst the crowd, the Zulus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1732"><a name="pos1732"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> Negative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1733"><a name="pos1733"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> When the shooting started, you described it at 1987 further as a "volley of shots" that started firing whilst you were standing with you back against the pharmacy, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1734"><a name="pos1734"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1735"><a name="pos1735"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> And that is then that you also experienced the people falling down around you, you can't say whether they were shot or not, but they were felling down around you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1736"><a name="pos1736"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1737"><a name="pos1737"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1738"><a name="pos1738"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRETORIUS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1739"><a name="pos1739"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> No questions thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1740"><a name="pos1740"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR DORFLING</p>
<p class="line" id="line1741"><a name="pos1741"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr van Greunen, would I be correct in saying that amongst the portion of the crowd that you saw, you didn't see a firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That is correct Madam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1743"><a name="pos1743"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But you would be unable to say whether of the approximately 500 members who constituted that crowd, none of them had a firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> I didn't see any firearms amongst the crowd.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Of the portion that you saw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> Of the portion that I saw, that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are you telling us that of the crowd that you saw, the entire crowd, because the evidence that is before us is that you were able to observe that the crowd consisted of approximately 500 members, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> That is correct Madam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Yes.  Would I be therefore correct that you didn't observe 500 members and you would be unable to say, of the 500 members that you saw, at least initially observed, you would be unable to say if none of them carried any firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1750"><a name="pos1750"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN GREUNEN:</span> I would be unable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1751"><a name="pos1751"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1752"><a name="pos1752"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you very much, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1753"><a name="pos1753"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1754"><a name="pos1754"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Chair may I just indicate, I've had word about the one gentleman that tried to locate the witness and as at 16h30 this afternoon we weren't able to locate Mr Mhlaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1755"><a name="pos1755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well if he's not here by 09h30 tomorrow morning we will proceed without him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1756"><a name="pos1756"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I would urge the Committee to consider obtaining the availability of Mr Mhlaba.  We're trying our best to locate him.  He had an appointment with me last week and it was arranged for the purposes of him here but I'm just having difficulty to locate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1757"><a name="pos1757"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well I'm not making a decision just now but I'm tempted to say that if we can't trace him by tomorrow morning then we'll have to proceed with the inquiry without him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1758"><a name="pos1758"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> When last was Mr Mhlaba seen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1759"><a name="pos1759"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I spoke to him in person on the last occasion when we took the adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Oh I see, okay.  But does he work in Johannesburg, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> He was unemployed at that point in time as far as I was aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1762"><a name="pos1762"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Yes, okay.  Was he informed that he would be required to come and give evidence today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1763"><a name="pos1763"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Indeed so, I made an appointment with him to see me last week for purposes of adducing his evidence in this week, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1764"><a name="pos1764"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Yes, thank you, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1765"><a name="pos1765"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The appointment was not made by you personally, but through somebody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1766"><a name="pos1766"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> No, no, I personally arranged with Mr Mhlaba to come and see me last week Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1767"><a name="pos1767"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1768"><a name="pos1768"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I saw him in person at the time of the last adjournment and I at that occasion arranged for him to come and see me last week and ever since he didn't turn up.  We have trying to locate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1769"><a name="pos1769"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Is there any - do you have any other witness that we might be able to hear perhaps in the absence of Mr Mhlaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1770"><a name="pos1770"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> From my side I've got no further witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1771"><a name="pos1771"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> What about your colleagues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1772"><a name="pos1772"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> We've got no witnesses we'd like to call, but all I'm going to submit is just some further pages by Mr du Plessis of the ballistic experts.  Honourable Chairman and Committee members would recall that my learned friend, Mr Berger submitted certain pages but not the full report, and there's just a few pages in addition to that which I would like to submit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1773"><a name="pos1773"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Chair, may I just reverting to Mr Mhlaba indicate that on the last occasion when I saw him, the date for this hearing hadn't been fixed, that's why we only had an arrangement to see each other prior to the hearing and unfortunately I couldn't fix a date because I didn't see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1774"><a name="pos1774"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, I'm now going to adjourn and we'll resume at 09h30 tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1775"><a name="pos1775"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1776"><a name="pos1776"></a>ON RESUMPTION:  04.08.98 - DAY 2</p>
<p class="line" id="line1777"><a name="pos1777"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before the commencing of evidence I'd just like to place on record the tragedy suffered by Ms Ramula Patel, the leader of evidence.  She received news last night that her mother had passed away after a short illness, and she had to leave early this morning.  We're sorry that she's had to meet this kind of difficulty and my Committee will be conveying our sympathies to her and to the other members of her family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1778"><a name="pos1778"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman we would like to place on record our sadness about the announcement of this event.  She is a person who has been of tremendous assistance to all of us in making documents available and always being available and we associate ourselves with the remarks that you have made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1779"><a name="pos1779"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Could we likewise on behalf of the objectors convey our sympathies to the family and bereaved ones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1780"><a name="pos1780"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> From our side we'd like to convey our sympathies as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1781"><a name="pos1781"></a>	There's just one further thing, Ms Patel assisted us by making available to us her copy of the record so that we could make copies of that last night, on the understanding that we return it to her this morning.  We've indeed got the copies here, her copy here to be returned to her but unfortunately we can't return it to her now in view of the circumstances.  May I request from the Chair to indicate to us to whom we can return it so that it can eventually find its way to herself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1782"><a name="pos1782"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At the conclusion of these hearings you can bring them over to me and I will see to it that it reaches her.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1783"><a name="pos1783"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1784"><a name="pos1784"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Dorfling your witness is ready?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1785"><a name="pos1785"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Indeed so Mr Chair.  I beg leave to call Mr Bafana Gonzweize Mhlaba.  The witness will be giving his evidence in the Zulu language, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1786"><a name="pos1786"></a><span class="speaker">BAFANA GONZWEIZE MHLABA:</span> (Duly sworn in, states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1787"><a name="pos1787"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR DORFLING:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1788"><a name="pos1788"></a>	Mr Mhlaba you were born in 1957, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1789"><a name="pos1789"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1790"><a name="pos1790"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You were brought up in the Zulu culture, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1791"><a name="pos1791"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1792"><a name="pos1792"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Do you still adhere to Zulu tradition and Zulu rituals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1793"><a name="pos1793"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1794"><a name="pos1794"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Have you undergone any formal schooling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1795"><a name="pos1795"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I didn't attend school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1796"><a name="pos1796"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> On the 28th of March 1994 you were residing at the Mansfield Hostel in room no E7, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1797"><a name="pos1797"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1798"><a name="pos1798"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Presently you are unemployed, were you employed at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1799"><a name="pos1799"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, I worked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1800"><a name="pos1800"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Now there was a planned Zulu gathering at Library Gardens on the 28th of March 1994, did this come to your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I was told by our team leader or our Induna, Mr Mbatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> What were you told by Mr Mbatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Mbatha told us that there is an imbezo, a meeting, where the King will be present and that will be in town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Was any venue in specific mentioned to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1805"><a name="pos1805"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> They said we will meet at the place he said, the garden, Library Gardens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1806"><a name="pos1806"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Did you at that stage know where the Library Gardens were situated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1807"><a name="pos1807"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I didn't know the place personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1808"><a name="pos1808"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> How were you going to find your way there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Mr Mbatha was to direct us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Is that Induna Mbatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1812"><a name="pos1812"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can you describe the events of the morning of the 28th of March 1994?  I want you to start at the hostel, how you found your route to town and what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, I can explain before the Committee.  I don't know whether I can continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes, please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> On that particular day as we were informed earlier before the day, on the 28th we were called as usual by a clock.  On our arrival the Induna took us into a train.  At the Mansfield Station we went in and we got into the train and we departed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> The people that boarded the train, were they residents of the Mansfield Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1817"><a name="pos1817"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, but I will not know because we find some other people waiting at the station, they might be people from outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1818"><a name="pos1818"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Fine you may proceed, you then boarded the train, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1819"><a name="pos1819"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> The train pulled out, we were happy until we arrived at Park Station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes, what happened at Park Station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> When we arrived at Park Station, those who were in the front coaches, as we were in the middle coaches, they went out of the train while our group went out following them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Were you divided into two groups at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say I don't remember if there were more that two, but I would say ... (no further English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Excuse me, there are some technical problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can I for the convenience of the Interpreter just perhaps repeat the question.  Were you divided into two groups at that point in time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> As I have explained, when I alighted from the train there was one group infront of us, I was in the second group myself.  I won't be able to say if there was a third or another group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> May I interpose, when you got out of the station, you yourself in the group in which you were in, did you meet with the second group?  Did you meet the second group to form one group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> When we went outside we didn't combine to form one group, we just followed each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> "We just follow each other", you mean going to the same direction, the same ..(indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1831"><a name="pos1831"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Did you have anybody in particular leading your group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1832"><a name="pos1832"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Nobody was an Induna in our group, the Induna was in front, however there were marshals who controlled us, or the chorus leaders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> If you say the Induna was in the front, was that in the front of the first group in other words, to leave the station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, he was infront of the first group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes, what happened as you come out of the station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Out of the station we saw our brothers who were being turned back from a direction which we were supposed to proceed.  Our brothers were stopped by the police and we were told that we should turn to the left and use that street to the left.  We followed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You are referring to you "brothers", are you referring to the first group or to other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I'm talking about the first group which was in front of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You explained that they were turned back, and then later you explained they were asked to turn left, can you just explain what exactly happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> The truth is I didn't say they were turned back, I said since they were in front of us they were told that they shouldn't take the turn out from the Park Station, they should take the left turn and take the road from the Park Station, not that they should go back but they should turn to the left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes, did your group follow that group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes we followed them, the group that was told to turn to the left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1843"><a name="pos1843"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1844"><a name="pos1844"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> The group in front of us proceeded to the left and we followed it.  It was on a certain street they took a turn, I will say it is the second street, they turned to the right, and we were following them.  There were some sounds of explosion and I didn't know from which direction they were coming from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1845"><a name="pos1845"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can I just interpose here Mr Mhlaba.  Do you know the street names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1846"><a name="pos1846"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I don't know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1847"><a name="pos1847"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Okay, you mentioned that the first group at the second street turned to their right, you followed them and then there was this sound of explosions, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1848"><a name="pos1848"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Since we're behind them and we didn't take a turn we heard explosions but we didn't know where they were coming from, we were still far back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1849"><a name="pos1849"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> If you say an explosion, is it like a bomb or something else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1850"><a name="pos1850"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> The sound of guns or rifles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1851"><a name="pos1851"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Could you at that point in time determine from where these gunshots were coming?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1852"><a name="pos1852"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> As I said, I will not be in a position to explain as to where the sound was coming from because I was right inbetween the buildings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1853"><a name="pos1853"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You've mentioned that the first group turned right at the second street, did your group follow them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1854"><a name="pos1854"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes we also turned right and on the second street they turned and that's where we came to meet them to form one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1855"><a name="pos1855"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I just want to make sure we understand you correctly, so as you were directed to go left at the station you proceeded over one street and at the second street the first group turned to their right, and your group followed them, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1856"><a name="pos1856"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1857"><a name="pos1857"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> And what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1858"><a name="pos1858"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> When we met them and form one group, as I've explained, we met them at that turn and we formed one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1859"><a name="pos1859"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> If you say "you met them at a turn", what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1860"><a name="pos1860"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> As we're following each other and they were in front of us, we found them standing as we're coming from behind, so we met them there and we formed one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1861"><a name="pos1861"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Mhlaba I want you to explain, you said you found them and met with them at a turn, can you just explain that please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1862"><a name="pos1862"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> When I say we met them in Zulu, as I've explained we were following each other, when someone come to a stop and you came to that place, it means we met, it means we are no longer following each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Can you briefly explain yourself.  I would like you to explain to me that at the time when you were still following each other, the other group was in front of you, was it at any stage did you ever went a different direction, took a different street, or were you walking on the same street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1864"><a name="pos1864"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> We were on the same street but we were not close to each other.  I will say that we're about some few paces from each other but on the same street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1865"><a name="pos1865"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> When you say there was a time where you came to meet each other, did you mean that those in front came to a stop and they waited for you to arrive at the same spot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, they stopped for us so that we can meet and form one group to go together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1867"><a name="pos1867"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Was it not because you took different roads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1868"><a name="pos1868"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1869"><a name="pos1869"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> That was the clarification that was needed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1870"><a name="pos1870"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> If I could just interpose for a second, you said you met them at a turn, and I understood Mr Dorfling to ask you, "what do you mean by at a turn"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1871"><a name="pos1871"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Indeed so, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1872"><a name="pos1872"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I didn't say we met at a turn, I said we took a turn on the second road or street and just before there's the intersection, they stop and waited for us.  So I would say that's an intersection, a four-way stop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1873"><a name="pos1873"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I'm indebted to the Committee members, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1874"><a name="pos1874"></a>	What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1875"><a name="pos1875"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> We left as one group and there was Mr Mbatha as one of the marshals controlling the crowd, and that's where the shooting started.  It looked like they were inside the building.  They shot at us and we turned to run away.  When I turned to look back I saw one of my colleagues or my friend injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1876"><a name="pos1876"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can we just stop there for a moment Mr Mhlaba.  I would like you to go slowly and explain everything that you saw on that day.  Can we first just go back at the time when you were together at the intersection, the two groups.  Just before the shooting commenced, what were you doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1877"><a name="pos1877"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> We were shouting our Zulu - it's a tradition praise song, shouting in Zulu "amandla", ...[indistinct] as power to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1878"><a name="pos1878"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> No, no, Mr Interpreter, the witness was saying "uSotho", not "amandla".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1879"><a name="pos1879"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> With your leave Mr Chair I would ask the witness to get up from where he's standing and perhaps just give a description of the movement that was taking place at that point in time and the words that were uttered, with your leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1880"><a name="pos1880"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1881"><a name="pos1881"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can I perhaps ask the witness to come to the front somewhere here to just make it visible to all of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1882"><a name="pos1882"></a>MR MHLABA DEMONSTRATES AS REQUESTED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1883"><a name="pos1883"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, I'm indebted to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1884"><a name="pos1884"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Witness describes a movement forward and with every two steps a short step backwards, but at each time he moved his right arm was raised above his shoulder when he repeated the words "Amandla Awetho" and the word "Usotho".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1885"><a name="pos1885"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I'm indebted for that Mr Chair.  A further significant which I would perhaps like to place on record if the Committee is in agreement with that, is that the one foot is constantly leading, the one foot remains behind the other.  A step forward, either the left foot or the right foot leading at the time of the forward movement and it remains the same foot that's leading.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1886"><a name="pos1886"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any objection to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1887"><a name="pos1887"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There's no objections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1889"><a name="pos1889"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> What is the significance of this movement and these utterances Mr Mhlaba?  What does it mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1890"><a name="pos1890"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> It means that we, according to the Zulu tradition, when we are happy or celebrating to a function, it's always our tradition that we should do it step by step while shouting the praises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1891"><a name="pos1891"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I note that you say whilst shouting the praises, are the words you used actually praise words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1892"><a name="pos1892"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I'm not understanding, I'm not getting the full understanding of what you are saying.  I would like a clarification.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1893"><a name="pos1893"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes, you mentioned that this is always the way we do things when we're shouting the praises, that's the way it was translated.  I'm trying to ask you or to convey to you that you should try and explain that to the Committee.  These praises you're referring to, are those the words you used, are those praise words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1894"><a name="pos1894"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say those are the words that we use to celebrate when we're celebrating.  When we are going to an Imbizo, a traditional meeting or whatever meeting called in the community to meet the King.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Are there words you uttered, are these words you uttered and the movements you made on that day any different from what you would do during other gatherings on behalf of ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Mr Dorfling, just a minute.  Did you say that ...(no English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1897"><a name="pos1897"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> ...(no English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1898"><a name="pos1898"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Ja okay, you said these words are the words that you normally use when you are to meet Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1899"><a name="pos1899"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I mean when we're having meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1900"><a name="pos1900"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> But not to meet the King?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say the meeting of the Zulus is when we're asked to meet the King or a Chief, we use the same words.  We always do it in the name of the King.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You were doing this movement and uttering these words at the time when the shooting commenced.  Can you describe in detail what you saw yourself, not what you were told by anybody else, what you yourself observed when the shooting commenced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say the truth is, when we started chanting together as a group they started shooting at us.  We didn't continue forward, we ran backwards.  Some of our friends didn't manage to escape because when I turned back, I realised that one of our friends was injured from the back and he was bleeding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Before you attended to this friend of yours, can you describe whether you say anybody shooting in the direction of the marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1905"><a name="pos1905"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes I did see the people who were shooting.  I can't remember the number but they were under the building.  There were some on top of the building, about three of them who were shooting at us, shooting from above.  I saw them while trying to help the injured brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can I again ask you to just take it step by step.  The people that you saw, as you call it: "under the building", would you describe exactly where you saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1907"><a name="pos1907"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> In front of us, towards our direction where we're going, the direction in which we're proceeding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1908"><a name="pos1908"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Were they down the street in the direction you were continuing in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1909"><a name="pos1909"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Can you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1910"><a name="pos1910"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Were they further down the street in the direction you were continuing in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, they were on the same street, right in front of us.  I wouldn't say down or up the street but they were really on the same street, just before us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Now you were at that point in time, roughly at an intersection you've described?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Now how far ahead of you did you see these people, just roughly?  If you can perhaps with reference to a building or a street indicate where they were positioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1915"><a name="pos1915"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say from where I am they will be on the opposite building, on the other side, I will say referring to Small Street, just to the other building after passing Small Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1916"><a name="pos1916"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Chair I would venture to suggest in the region of 50 metres perhaps from where the witness is sitting to the other side of the Small Street Road so to speak, just outside the church.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1917"><a name="pos1917"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1918"><a name="pos1918"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Not very clear views, but we'll accept that as a rough figure Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You've described the people in that direction, did you yourself see any of them shooting in the direction of the marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1920"><a name="pos1920"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Some of them whom I saw, there were those who were on top of the building which we were to pass, it building in stones.  They were standing on top of the building and they were shooting at us.  That was the last time I saw the people who shot at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1921"><a name="pos1921"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can we just go back to the first person or persons that you saw shooting in the direction of the crowd, who are they and where were they positioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1922"><a name="pos1922"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I wouldn't be able to say who they were, they were dressed in white clothes.  I don't know how many there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1923"><a name="pos1923"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Mhlaba in your evidence you have talked about two different people, there were those who were in front of you and there were others who were shooting from the top of the building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1924"><a name="pos1924"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1925"><a name="pos1925"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Your lawyer is trying to find out exactly who were the first between these two groups to shoot at you.  Were they the people who were right in front of you or whether they were the people on top of the building who started shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1926"><a name="pos1926"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say the people who first shot at us, they were the people who were right in front of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1927"><a name="pos1927"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Now can we go through it step by step and just take it slowly Mr Mhlaba.  You see the people in front of you, they shoot in the direction of the crowd, what do you do?  Just slowly, step by step.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> When they started shooting at us we turned back and ran.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1929"><a name="pos1929"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes, and what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1930"><a name="pos1930"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> While we were running back, not all of us managed to escape the shooting, as we were running back, those from the top of the building, they also started shooting at us.  They shot one of our friends, and I tried to help him, and that's where I got shot too, while trying to help him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1931"><a name="pos1931"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can you again just describe in detail, you say a friend of yours got shot, did he fall down, did he remain upright?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> He got shot and he fell, because when I turned back as I was running, I found that he was bleeding from the back and when I tried to tried to remove the jersey to find out where the wound was, that's when I got shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1933"><a name="pos1933"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Can you just describe your own position when you were hit by the bullet, were you at that point in time upright or what was your position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1934"><a name="pos1934"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say I was kneeling, I was just bending, and he was lying on the ground.  I was just to pull up his jersey to see how he was injured, and I got shot at that time and I fell next to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1935"><a name="pos1935"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I saw you actually getting up from your chair, you were bending forward with you upper body, is that right?  Were you bending over the injured person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1936"><a name="pos1936"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, what do you mean when I was bending forward?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1937"><a name="pos1937"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> You bent your upper body over the man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1938"><a name="pos1938"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1939"><a name="pos1939"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> And you've indicated that this was the time when you were struck by a bullet.  Can you please indicate where you were hit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1940"><a name="pos1940"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1941"><a name="pos1941"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes, where were you hit by the bullet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1942"><a name="pos1942"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I was shot here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1943"><a name="pos1943"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1944"><a name="pos1944"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> As it pleases the Committee Mr Chair.  What happened then Mr Mhlaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1945"><a name="pos1945"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> The police arrived and they tried to push me to the corner of the intersection.  All I could remember seeing, I saw the things and after I fell I didn't see anything except the police coming to come and help us, and they took me into an ambulance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1946"><a name="pos1946"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> At the time when you got shot, did you carry anything with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1947"><a name="pos1947"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, I was holding a stick, a shield and a spear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1948"><a name="pos1948"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Interpreter did the witness the word "uboko" and "induko"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1949"><a name="pos1949"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Sharpened stick.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1950"><a name="pos1950"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Yes, I would just like your guidance Mr Committee members, I picked up two words "induko" and "uboko".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1951"><a name="pos1951"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1952"><a name="pos1952"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> No, I think all the words were right, but I think I've just got one word missing.  "Induko" and "uboko".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1953"><a name="pos1953"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> "Induko" is a stick Mr Dorfling, it's a ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1954"><a name="pos1954"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I'm made to believe that "uboko" is also a stick, just a longer stick.  Maybe we can ask the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1955"><a name="pos1955"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Mr Mhlaba just repeat, tell us what did you carry on the previous question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1956"><a name="pos1956"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I was holding a shield, a "boko", it's a long stick which has a tail.  On the other side I was holding a knobkierrie, on the other side there was also a spear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1957"><a name="pos1957"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Did you at the time when the shooting started, did you become aware of any firearms being discharged from amongst the group of marchers where you were positioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1958"><a name="pos1958"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I didn't see any firearm among those people in front of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1959"><a name="pos1959"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Did you become aware of anybody discharging a firearm in your vicinity?  Amongst the marchers in other words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1960"><a name="pos1960"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> As I've explained before the Committee, I didn't see anyone holding a firearm.  I didn't see anyone with my eyes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1961"><a name="pos1961"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you hear anyone firing a firearm around you?  I think that's what Mr Dorfling is also trying to ask you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1962"><a name="pos1962"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> The way this shooting happened, even if there was someone shooting just beside you, you wouldn't be able to detect that because there was a lot of noise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1963"><a name="pos1963"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> The noise you're talking about, is it the noise of your chanting or was it the noise that was caused by the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1964"><a name="pos1964"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> This was a noise of the shooting.  There were firearm crackings coming from all directions I would say, you couldn't say from which direction the shooting's coming from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1965"><a name="pos1965"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> And can I just determine from you, immediately prior to the shooting starting, prior to you observing the people in front of you that fired in the direction of the crowd, was there any shooting from amongst the Zulu marchers at that point in time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1966"><a name="pos1966"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> As I've already explained, the shooting started when Mr Mbatha was telling us we shall now continue as one group.  It was when we met the first group to form one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1967"><a name="pos1967"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Was there at that point in time any shooting amongst the marchers, that's what I'm asking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1968"><a name="pos1968"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I didn't hear any shooting within us and I didn't see any shooting.  I'm not saying there wasn't but I didn't witness such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1969"><a name="pos1969"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Now after you got injured that day, did you go to hospital, were you hospitalised for your injury?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1970"><a name="pos1970"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, I went to hospital.  We were told that they can't help us because there were so many people who were so badly injured and we were told that we should wait for medical treatment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1971"><a name="pos1971"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> And how long were you away from work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1972"><a name="pos1972"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I stayed about 3 months without work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1973"><a name="pos1973"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Now Mr Mhlaba, if people were to come to this Committee and give evidence that the Zulu people, the marchers, were attacking the building or the personnel of Shell House, the people working there, and that's the reason why the Zulu people got shot at, what would you comment be to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1974"><a name="pos1974"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I will deny that because I personally as a grown-up person, it was a peaceful march and when we got shot we were surprised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1975"><a name="pos1975"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I've got no further questions to the witness that you Mr Chair, Members of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1976"><a name="pos1976"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DORLFLING</p>
<p class="line" id="line1977"><a name="pos1977"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1978"><a name="pos1978"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Just one aspect please Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1979"><a name="pos1979"></a>	The way in which you moved and which you described to the Committee, is that the normal way that the Zulus move when they go to attend a peaceful meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1980"><a name="pos1980"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, that's correct, that's our tradition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1981"><a name="pos1981"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Would it have been any different if you had for instance to war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1982"><a name="pos1982"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, there will be striking difference, because when we're going to war we don't even talk to each other, we just walk and there is no chanting or singing, we just proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1983"><a name="pos1983"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1984"><a name="pos1984"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR TIPP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Mhlaba you considered yourself at the time as one of the "Amabuto"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1985"><a name="pos1985"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1986"><a name="pos1986"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And when the amabuto move, do they move with discipline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1987"><a name="pos1987"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1988"><a name="pos1988"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Is it the usual way of movement that every group is under charge of an Induna?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1989"><a name="pos1989"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, that's correct, each group has to have its own leader or Induna.  Even if it's not the Induna himself, there will be the assistant Induna.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1990"><a name="pos1990"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And the senior Induna in this case, Mr Mbatha, would see to it that each group was under the charge of a responsible Induna or someone else appointed to be in control?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1991"><a name="pos1991"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1992"><a name="pos1992"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You know of course of Induna Kanyele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1993"><a name="pos1993"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1994"><a name="pos1994"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Did you see him on that morning when the groups were forming up Park Station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1995"><a name="pos1995"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I didn't see him because those who were in front of us, we couldn't see them.  We couldn't see, those were really in front of the first group because we could only see the people from the back on the first group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1996"><a name="pos1996"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Mhlaba, I'm talking about your group.  Is it not so that Induna Kanyele was in charge of the second group that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1997"><a name="pos1997"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> As I've explained, when we went out of Park Station in numbers, the one who was our leader - I wouldn't say we have a real leader, there were however marshals, and the person that I remember seeing in front of us was Mr Mbatha, and I didn't see Kanyele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1998"><a name="pos1998"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Mhlaba these groups were large in number, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1999"><a name="pos1999"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2000"><a name="pos2000"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> In each of them there were several hundred members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2001"><a name="pos2001"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes I would say that's correct, even if I won't be able to give a specific number, be we were more than hundred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2002"><a name="pos2002"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> I'm not asking you for specific numbers.  Now ahead of you there was a large group, and at the head of that there was the senior Induna, Mr Mbatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2003"><a name="pos2003"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2004"><a name="pos2004"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now I understood you to say a little while ago that the usual way of movement is that each and every group has someone appointed to be in charge and in control of that group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2005"><a name="pos2005"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> My word is when we are going to a function we're normally accompanied by an Induna and the Induna has his own marshals who will control the crowd to make sure that they don't do things which are out our objectives, and as we march any member who is a little bit senior will always be in charge of controlling the marchers.  It's not necessarily the Induna's who will always be conducting the crowd.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2006"><a name="pos2006"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Just tell us, was there a person in charge of your group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2007"><a name="pos2007"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say he was a person just like me, he was not an Induna just a respected member, so he was well versed when it comes to conducting those marches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2008"><a name="pos2008"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> I think you've talked about - see what counsel is trying to find out from you is that there was the first group which was ahead of you and which was being led by Induna Mbatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2009"><a name="pos2009"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2010"><a name="pos2010"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> And then there was this second one in which you were, was coming from behind, and you said there were people who had been the Induna?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2011"><a name="pos2011"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2012"><a name="pos2012"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Was there any person who was acting as a leading who was walking in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2013"><a name="pos2013"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I will say there was no-one who was acting as the leader, we were moving just as a group following the front group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2014"><a name="pos2014"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Was Kanyele among the leaders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2015"><a name="pos2015"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes he was present, I would say he was one of the people who were acting as marshals directing the crowd.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2016"><a name="pos2016"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> In which group was he, was he in the second group or the first one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2017"><a name="pos2017"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say he was conducting part of our group, but he was not concentrating on our group, he will go forward and go back to see that we are proceeding accordingly.  As he was patrolling there was another person on the other side controlling the crowd.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2018"><a name="pos2018"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Mhlaba is it correct that you are expected when you move in these groups, to remain in your groups, and that if for example the group at the front stops for some reason, then the second group will also stop, it doesn't simply proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2019"><a name="pos2019"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2020"><a name="pos2020"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now where in your group were you, were you at the front or in the middle somewhere, or towards the back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2021"><a name="pos2021"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say I was in the middle, just in the middle, but I was not far from the front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2022"><a name="pos2022"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Yes, is it also so that when groups of this nature move through cities like Johannesburg, that they are required and expected to obey police instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2023"><a name="pos2023"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes that's correct.  When we walk in the city we'll have to follow the directions given by the police because we have a route which we have to follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2024"><a name="pos2024"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well apart from the fact that you've got a route, is it something that is conveyed to you by your leaders, by your Induna's that if a policeman comes to a group with an instruction, that the group must obey him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2025"><a name="pos2025"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> That's correct, we are usually instructed that wherever we go we shall follow the law and we shall listen to the law officers, and we shall listen to anyone who has authority to direct us to whatever place we are going to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2026"><a name="pos2026"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> So for example if you are moving with a group of "amabutu" and two policemen were to approach from the front and raise their hands and make it clear that you should stop, then you would normally stop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2027"><a name="pos2027"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, that's correct, we have to stop.  We have to stop and listen to what they want to say to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2028"><a name="pos2028"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now Mr Mhlaba, if you were in the second group, and in the middle of the second group, were you still in that position when you turned - you took the right turn into the street where eventually the shooting took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2029"><a name="pos2029"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Can you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2030"><a name="pos2030"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Certainly.  Let me take it in pieces, Mr Chairman.  You've told us that you were somewhere in the middle of your group, not very far from the front, were you still in that position after you had taken the right turn into the street where the shooting took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2031"><a name="pos2031"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say after getting out from the Park Station I wasn't far to the front.  We took a turn to join the other group ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2032"><a name="pos2032"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> My question Mr Mhlaba, is whether you were still in that same position in your group after you had taken the turn, can you tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2033"><a name="pos2033"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes I was still in the same position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2034"><a name="pos2034"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You then saw the front group come to a stop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2035"><a name="pos2035"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, they were already standing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2036"><a name="pos2036"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now was this something that was arranged, that you would then joint them and form one group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2037"><a name="pos2037"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say this was not arranged, but we just saw Mr Mbatha stopping there and calling the second group to join them, that's how we came to meet with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2038"><a name="pos2038"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Can you just describe that for us in detail?  Mr Mbatha was in the front of a large group that was in the front of your group, did you in fact see him give instructions that you were all to form one group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2039"><a name="pos2039"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I didn't hear him personally speaking, as we were far behind.  I will try to demonstrate - that's how we come to a stop and wait for others.  We normally kneel and wait for the others.  As we saw them in that position, we signalled that they were stopping.  I could see that he was calling us by his hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2040"><a name="pos2040"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> So you personally saw quite clearly that the senior Induna, Mr Mbatha, was calling your group to merge with his group to form one larger group just in front of that intersection, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2041"><a name="pos2041"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, that's what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2042"><a name="pos2042"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> What did you understand the reason for this merger to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2043"><a name="pos2043"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I didn't know what was the problem, I thought maybe he wanted to make sure that we stay as one group.  And we didn't know exactly - most of us didn't know where we were going, he was the only man who knew where we were going, so he wanted to make sure that we proceeded together as one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2044"><a name="pos2044"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well up to that point there'd been no problems in the movement of the two groups as they went along the street, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2045"><a name="pos2045"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> After the meeting of the groups Mr Mbatha instructed us to proceed, and that's where the shooting started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2046"><a name="pos2046"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Mhlaba I think perhaps my question was not clearly formulated, I'm going to put it again.  As you moved in at least two groups from Park Station up to the point of that intersection, there had been no difficulties or problems with the movement in separate groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2047"><a name="pos2047"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, there were no problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2048"><a name="pos2048"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And I take it that the reason for breaking into smaller groups in the way that you did at Park Station as you moved through streets, is because it's easier to maintain control.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2049"><a name="pos2049"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2050"><a name="pos2050"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> See I'm going to suggest to you that this unusual development under the instructions of your senior Induna, that you form into one large group at this intersection, was so that you would form one large group for the purpose of carrying out an attack, and not for the purpose of moving further in the streets in the normal way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2051"><a name="pos2051"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would like to with respect, deny that.  It wasn't for the purpose of shooting because if it was the case of ...(indistinct) where we have to attack, we wouldn't put women in front.  When we - our tradition is that when we go to fight, we normally put the men in front, and it would be men only, with women not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2052"><a name="pos2052"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Mhlaba I am regrettably not very well versed in Zulu tradition and Zulu culture, but perhaps you can tell us, "amandla aweto", are you saying that that forms part of a Zulu traditional praise song or praise chant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2053"><a name="pos2053"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say, put it clearly, any person, they don't have to be a Zulu-speaking person, people normally shout "amandla aweto", meaning power to us.  This has originated from the Zulu tradition, so I would say that's the reason why we were shouting "power to us" and "we will win as one".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2054"><a name="pos2054"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And the cry or the chant "usotho" is, as I understand it, typically a battle-cry, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2055"><a name="pos2055"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> That's not true.  "Usotho" goes to explain that we are the Zulu nation.  As you know, there is "mangosotho", it's a tradition that we are following as Zulu people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2056"><a name="pos2056"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Mhlaba, isn't it so that when traditionally and historically that when Zulu warriors went to war, that the typical battle-cry that accompanies them as an expression of their pride and their military prowess, was "usotho"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2057"><a name="pos2057"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I did not understand your word, you're talking about the soldiers of Kwa-Zulu, or the warriors or Kwa-Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2058"><a name="pos2058"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> I'm speaking as best I can in historical and traditional terms of Zulu warriors, and that when Zulu warriors went to war, "usotho" would be their principal chant expressing their pride and their military strength as they attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2059"><a name="pos2059"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I never heard that when going to war the warriors would be singing songs or chanting slogans.  I know that people prepare for the war and nobody will instruct them to be singing when going to war, because that would show the directions as to where they are from their opponents if they start singing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2060"><a name="pos2060"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> We'll move on Mr Mhlaba from that.  You have described how your group on instructions from Induna Mbatha merged with the group in front, did you also see a group which was in the street on your right-hand side?  In other words to the right of that very same intersection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2061"><a name="pos2061"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say the only group that we met was the group in front us.  I didn't see any group on the other side, I only saw one group, the one which was in front of us which we came to form one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2062"><a name="pos2062"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Just describe for us please, the process of forming one group, did you for example - or did your group simply merge at the back of the front group, or did you push your way through the front group to the front of it, what exactly happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2063"><a name="pos2063"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Those in front, as I've already demonstrated, the Induna have stopped them and he signalled by hand, telling us to come closer.  While they were kneeling there we came near, and then we came to join them and we were told to stand up and proceed.  That's what we did, and we continued as one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2064"><a name="pos2064"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Let me just put it in these words Mr Mhlaba, is what you are describing then a process where the gap between the back of the first group and the front of the second group, your group, was done away with, and that's all that happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2065"><a name="pos2065"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, we formed one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2066"><a name="pos2066"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well is my description of it correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2067"><a name="pos2067"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> As I've already explained, that's how we met and formed one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2068"><a name="pos2068"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> So you were never near the front of what had been the first group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2069"><a name="pos2069"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes I wasn't in front, as I've explained before, I was - in the second group I was just in the middle near to the front.  Even when we managed to form one group, I was still in the middle of the one group.  When we joined them we were from behind.  I wouldn't be able to say how far from behind or from the front - I wouldn't be able to say who was in front and who was at the back at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2070"><a name="pos2070"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> I'm not sure what you mean by that Mr Mhlaba.  Can I just put it to you again.  In front of you there was a group with many hundred-strong under the charge of Induna Mbatha.  Behind that there was a second group, you were in that group.  As you approached the intersection, the front group was stopped and Induna Mbatha said become one group, and the front of your group went up to the back of the first group.  Is that what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2071"><a name="pos2071"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2072"><a name="pos2072"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And were you still on the - you yourself had not yet reached the intersection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2073"><a name="pos2073"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say even the other group, they haven't yet reached the intersection, we were all about to reach.  When we came into the intersection we were now proceeding as one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2074"><a name="pos2074"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> To be clear about that, the front of the first group had not yet reached the intersection at that stage, the stage when you became one group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2075"><a name="pos2075"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes they were not yet at the intersection, they were just near the intersection.  They were just before the robot, they were not yet into the intersection, they were about to enter the intersection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2076"><a name="pos2076"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Could you perhaps indicate to us here how far you were at that time from the front of the first group?  In other words the very front of the now combined group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2077"><a name="pos2077"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Are you talking about the second group, how far we were, or you mean all of us combined as one group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2078"><a name="pos2078"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You've told us that you became one group, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2079"><a name="pos2079"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2080"><a name="pos2080"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now all I want is for you to indicate where you personally were, how far were you from the front of the group?  In other words the front of what had been the first group.  Do you follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2081"><a name="pos2081"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Ja.  I will estimate the distance as it - I will from the Interpreter, the lady Interpreter, it will be distance from where I am to the Interpreter, the lady Interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2082"><a name="pos2082"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> About 20 metres Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2083"><a name="pos2083"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it's about 20 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2084"><a name="pos2084"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Mhlaba, we know that in that intersection there was a white man with long hair, a tall man, who circled in that intersection, calling on the marchers to stop.  Did you see that person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2085"><a name="pos2085"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I didn't see the person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2086"><a name="pos2086"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> We know that his efforts were unsuccessful and that he was overrun when the group advanced and was in fact struck a number of times and injured.  Did you notice anything of that sort happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2087"><a name="pos2087"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> As I said, I didn't see any person getting injured.  I don't know, maybe one of those who were in front will have seen that, but myself as a person in the middle of the group, I didn't see anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2088"><a name="pos2088"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You say that your group was just moving forward, or the entire group was just moving forward slowly and very peacefully?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2089"><a name="pos2089"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2090"><a name="pos2090"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Did you see two uniformed policemen approach the front of that group in a clear attempt to stop it and to divert it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2091"><a name="pos2091"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Where were these police standing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2092"><a name="pos2092"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> They came from the direction in which you were heading, straight towards the front of the group with their arms outstretched, calling on them to turn away and making it clear that they shouldn't proceed further down that street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2093"><a name="pos2093"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I didn't see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2094"><a name="pos2094"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well they have given evidence, they have explained that they were knocked aside by this group, one of them was injured as a result of being struck with a spear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2095"><a name="pos2095"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would not deny that, but what I know is we were told that the police were there to protect us.  I don't think all this happened, it might have happened another day where I was not present.  It's possible that when you're in the middle of a group you might not be able to see what happens on the other side of the group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2096"><a name="pos2096"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You see I'm putting it to you that those are not disputed descriptions of what happened, and I want you to explain as far as you can, how it can be that such incidents take place in respect of a group that you say is moving slowly and peacefully.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2097"><a name="pos2097"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I am also asking the same question as to why were we attacked, because we were peaceful, no-one was provoking any person.  And I'm asking the same question, why were we attacked, because I didn't see any problem amongst us as we were marching.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2098"><a name="pos2098"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Do you want me to repeat the question Mr Mhlaba, because I'm not asking you to ask questions, I'm asking you to answer them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2099"><a name="pos2099"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> You can ask the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2100"><a name="pos2100"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Yes well let me put it again, and I'll put it more clearly.  The white gentleman that I've referred to has given evidence, or evidence has been accepted given by him under oath, that he was beaten by members of the group in which you were moving who were charging forward waving weapons in the manner of people carrying out an attack.  That evidence was given in the inquest, it was not challenged and it has been accepted here.  Now what do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2101"><a name="pos2101"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> With the greatest respect, I do not want to interrupt unnecessarily Mr Chair, but the interpretation of Mr von Eggedy as to the movement of the crowd was specifically canvassed at the time of the inquest with him, and there was also specific interpretation given to that evidence by Mr Justice Nugent in his judgement.  And I think if I recall correctly, specifically at page 137, in which Mr Justice Nugent made it quite clear that Mr von Eggedy's interpretation and the way he defined the movements was perhaps not that accurate, and to that extent that evidence is not accepted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2102"><a name="pos2102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can put what the evidence of Mr von Eggedy was, whether it was accepted by the inquest court or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2103"><a name="pos2103"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Yes, we'll deal with that in argument.  I'll put it on that basis Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2104"><a name="pos2104"></a>	Evidence was given by him that the crowd ignored his attempts to stop them, that they charged forward in the manner of people carrying out an attack, waving weapons, in the course of which he received a number of deliberate blows and was injured.  Now you were in that crowd, what do you say about that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2105"><a name="pos2105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I personally I was with the group.  I didn't see this white policeman getting injured from the position in which I was moving.  I won't be able to know, maybe on the other of the group he might have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2106"><a name="pos2106"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> From the position in which you were in this group, could you see the front of the group after the two groups had merged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2107"><a name="pos2107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, before we formed one group I could see the front but after the merging of the two groups I couldn't see what was happening in front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2108"><a name="pos2108"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> The lawyer is telling you that there was evidence given that there was a white man who came to stand before the united, the one group which was formed, he was trying to give them instructions but however he got injured, he was attacked.  He's saying the police also came to try to stop the group and you disobeyed them, is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2109"><a name="pos2109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say I can hear what you're saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2110"><a name="pos2110"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> When you say this group was proceeding peacefully and that some of the instructions given to you was that to follow people who were in authority, this means the policemen, how did it happen that this kind of incident could take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2111"><a name="pos2111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say that from my position as I was marching within the group, I didn't see any conflict or any problem as we were marching.  I only met the problem when we started getting shot or one of us was injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2112"><a name="pos2112"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Yes, we do accept that you didn't see these things happening, however the lawyer wants to find out that when you say you were marching peacefully and you were listening to instructions from police, why was one of the policemen who was trying to stop you, you didn't obey them and one of them got injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2113"><a name="pos2113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I will have an answer to that, I will say I was not in front but from my own knowledge from the time when we were deployed we were told to go to the meeting, we were told that we should co-operate with the police. However I'm not going to deny that any police was injured while marching.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2114"><a name="pos2114"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Can we just sum up what you're in a position to say Mr Mhlaba, that you were never really in a position to observe what was happening in the front of the group or what people there were doing, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2115"><a name="pos2115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes that's correct, that's what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2116"><a name="pos2116"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Can you tell us in relation to the intersection, where were you when you tried to help your colleague who had fallen and when you got injured yourself, when you were struck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2117"><a name="pos2117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> It was right at the intersection, because this brother of mine fell on one side next to a pavement just after passing the crossing street and that's where I also fell after I was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2118"><a name="pos2118"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> So you personally had gone right across the intersection, do I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2119"><a name="pos2119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, we were already across the street, because after meeting this first group and we formed one group we are about to cross the intersection and few people managed to cross the intersection, the others were still at the back and they turned and ran back and we all dived on the ground and those who were able to run, they ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2120"><a name="pos2120"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Mhlaba I'm going to ask you please just to take it slowly, I'll try and put my questions as simply as I can.  Were you personally across that intersection when you were struck, or had you not yet gone right across the intersection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2121"><a name="pos2121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I had already crossed the intersection, I had just finished crossing the street, I was on the other side of the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2122"><a name="pos2122"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Now I take it, I would imagine that you've been back to that scene since the event?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2123"><a name="pos2123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say I don't usually come to town.  Since I got injured I'm staying at home in the township.  I don't come to town that often and if I come to town I only come to the Commission and even today, that was the only time I'm coming here.  I'm also afraid to go towards that direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2124"><a name="pos2124"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Let me just make it clear, even for the purpose of preparing this statement that has been put in by you in this Commission, you didn't go back to the scene to look at street names or to point out where you had been at various stages of the events?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2125"><a name="pos2125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> As I've said, I can only describe as I'm sitting here as to how we moved during that day.  After as I proceeding, jumping the first street ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2126"><a name="pos2126"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Sorry, you're not answering the question, the question put to you was, as you are here now, did you get any chance to meet with your lawyers in preparation to give the evidence you are giving before the Commission?  Did you get a chance to go and see the scene where these things occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2127"><a name="pos2127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I did meet my lawyers as I'm here today, however we never went to that place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2128"><a name="pos2128"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> So you're still not able to assist us just with references to street names or anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2129"><a name="pos2129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes I don't know the name of the streets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2130"><a name="pos2130"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> You had crossed over the intersection, does that mean then that all the people who had been in front of you had gone into the street past the intersection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2131"><a name="pos2131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes those who were in front of me, they've already crossed the street, and those from behind, they were still on the other side, they haven't yet crossed.  It means only half the people who were in front managed to cross the street when the shooting started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2132"><a name="pos2132"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> And the portion of the street we're talking about is now the street right next to the building where you saw some people on the - I think you called it the roof, on the balcony, who were among those who fired shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2133"><a name="pos2133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, it is the one that passed next to the building on this hand.  It's on the other side of the building  ...(as he's demonstrating, can't get a clear picture).</p>
<p class="line" id="line2134"><a name="pos2134"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Mhlaba I'm sorry, you're doing all sorts of pointing out on the table, I'm afraid it's not assisting anybody here.  Mr Chairman I wonder, we'll put up a map and - a street-plan, I wonder if it might be an opportune moment, and we'll then continue on hopefully a clearer base.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2135"><a name="pos2135"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Chairman may I just indicate at this time, I went through the exercise of trying to plot the witness by way of a map, it's gonna be of no assistance to the Committee, it's gonna ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2136"><a name="pos2136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll take a short adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2137"><a name="pos2137"></a>HEARING ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2138"><a name="pos2138"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2139"><a name="pos2139"></a><span class="speaker">BAFANA GONZWEIZA MHLABA:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2140"><a name="pos2140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I've already explained before that I never even went to school.  As it has already been displayed, I'm lost, I don't even know where to start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2141"><a name="pos2141"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Has it ever been discussed with you what the name was of the building where this incident took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2142"><a name="pos2142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2143"><a name="pos2143"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Have you been told that it was Shell House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2144"><a name="pos2144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes they did tell me that it's Shell House building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2145"><a name="pos2145"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Yes alright, well let me just make an attempt, Mr Chairman we're not going to attempt unduly, if I can just ask my colleague to just point out where Shell House is, and to point out the portion of King George Street just to the left of it.  Now I'm going to ask you Mr Mhlaba, are you able to follow that the street next to that building? The building has been coloured green, and there's a street that has been pointed out to you running next to it, can you follow that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2146"><a name="pos2146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I can't see the street which we are using.  I don't know from the Park Station where we could be from the map.  From the Park Station, yes we proceeded from Park Station.  Which building are you talking about, is it this one?  When we're there we were coming from that direction and the first group was standing there.  We formed one group on that point and we proceeded down up and that's where they started shooting at us and the other person fell on that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2147"><a name="pos2147"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well that's very helpful Mr Mhlaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2148"><a name="pos2148"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are going to - if all that means anything at all ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2149"><a name="pos2149"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> I'm going to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2150"><a name="pos2150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As he points, will somebody read out the name of the streets or the roads that he's pointing at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2151"><a name="pos2151"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Yes, let me try to summarise what has been pointed out.  Mr Mhlaba has shown the direction from which they moved down King George Street from a northerly side towards a southern side.  He has identified the intersection of King George Street and De Villiers Street, and has pointed to a position just to the south of that intersection in the portion of King George Street adjacent to Shell House where he was when he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2152"><a name="pos2152"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2153"><a name="pos2153"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2154"><a name="pos2154"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> My learned friends it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2155"><a name="pos2155"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I confirm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2156"><a name="pos2156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2157"><a name="pos2157"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Thank you.  So just to round off this point then, the point that you've just showed to the Committee where you were, it means that many hundreds of marchers were in front of you further to the south of King George Street along Shell House.  I'm going to ask my colleague Mr Berger just to indicate the area and you can confirm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2158"><a name="pos2158"></a>	So in that portion of the street there were hundreds of people, hundreds of marchers in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2159"><a name="pos2159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, as we were crossing up - after crossing the street there were not many of them, but that's where the shooting occurred.  The other one fell right at the corner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2160"><a name="pos2160"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2161"><a name="pos2161"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2162"><a name="pos2162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2163"><a name="pos2163"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> The shooting in the general vicinity of the corner of King George and De Villiers, in that general vicinity, is that right Mr Mhlaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2164"><a name="pos2164"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I confirm that that is what the witness pointed out physically on the map.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2165"><a name="pos2165"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Yes, that's in order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2166"><a name="pos2166"></a>	Mr Mhlaba you've said already in your evidence earlier, you were asked whether there'd been any shooting from amongst the marchers, you say you didn't hear or see it but you can't say that there wasn't such shooting, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2167"><a name="pos2167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, I said so.  I didn't see anything, I will not deny what might have happened right in front of me as there was this large sounds of cracking guns.  I didn't know where they were coming from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2168"><a name="pos2168"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well let me put it, there was shooting from all around you, from all directions I think your phrase was, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2169"><a name="pos2169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> No I'm not saying that, I am saying that due to the sound of the firearms which were fired I couldn't tell where the sound was coming from but where the shooting started, it was the people who were on the ground who started shooting and then thereafter the people on top of the building started shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2170"><a name="pos2170"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Well I'm just going to put to you in conclusion, that there's evidence and the witnesses from the ANC say that shots had been fired from amongst your crowd before they fired, and that they fired because there was a charge, an attack on them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2171"><a name="pos2171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Why were we attacking them, if they say we were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2172"><a name="pos2172"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Chairman I don't propose to debate the matter, that completes our questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2173"><a name="pos2173"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR TIPP</p>
<p class="line" id="line2174"><a name="pos2174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2175"><a name="pos2175"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR DORFLING:</span> Just one aspect Mr Chair with your leave.  Mr Mhlaba had you prior to this day taken part in any Zulu marches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2176"><a name="pos2176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes it was not my first march with the Zulu marchers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2177"><a name="pos2177"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> And had you subsequent to this day taken part in any Zulu marches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2178"><a name="pos2178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2179"><a name="pos2179"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I've got no further questions thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2180"><a name="pos2180"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DORFLING</p>
<p class="line" id="line2181"><a name="pos2181"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> It was put to you that you gathered at the point where you say you did so that you can attack Shell House, and you denied that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2182"><a name="pos2182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, we didn't mean to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2183"><a name="pos2183"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> You then mentioned that there were women in the group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2184"><a name="pos2184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes they were with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2185"><a name="pos2185"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGCOBO:</span> Were there any women in front, as far as you can recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2186"><a name="pos2186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I would say amongst all the groups since we are just mixed, there were women in our group and even after we formed one group there were women.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2187"><a name="pos2187"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Mhlaba, you have stated that you were in the middle of the second group and Mr Tipp has tried to ascertain exactly where you were once the two groups had merged.  I just want you to estimate, probably by pointing if you can, from where you are to any part of this room, if you can, to show us exactly where you were by the time the two groups had merged.  I do understand that you were right at the back but I would like to just get a mental picture of exactly where you were once the two groups had merged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2188"><a name="pos2188"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, in relation to what, if I could just add that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2189"><a name="pos2189"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Once you came to the second group, where exactly were you before you started doing anything, before you started moving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2190"><a name="pos2190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> As I've explained before, when we came to meet the first group I would say from the female interpreter, that's the distance from where I am, I personally as a person who was in the second group from behind, I would say it will have been a distance from here to the interpreter's box.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2191"><a name="pos2191"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> This first group, if you can estimate as to how far it was, what distance will you give from where you are sitting, how far was it from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2192"><a name="pos2192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> You mean in respect to the second group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2193"><a name="pos2193"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I mean at the time when you joined the first group to form one.  You said when you arrived, Mbatha has already stopped them so that they can unite with you to form one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2194"><a name="pos2194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2195"><a name="pos2195"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> At that time, you said that you were about the distance from where you are to the interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2196"><a name="pos2196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I will say no, in the first group it will be from where I am, just from - if they were starting from here ...(witness is demonstrating) and ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2197"><a name="pos2197"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> In your evidence, if that is true, it will mean that you were not able, you're not in a position to see what's happening in front?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2198"><a name="pos2198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, as I've already stated I'm not sure of what happened inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2199"><a name="pos2199"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And again you wont be in a position to see what Mbatha was doing in front of the group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2200"><a name="pos2200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes I would be lying to say I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2201"><a name="pos2201"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And again you are not in a position to say that the people who were in front of the one group, they were people who were marching peacefully or otherwise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2202"><a name="pos2202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> No I can comment on that one, if they were doing something out of our mandate you could see, because you could see that.  However, unless if someone went out of the group and do something aside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2203"><a name="pos2203"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You mean beside getting out of group, you won't be able to know what was happening in front?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2204"><a name="pos2204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes I won't be able to see exactly what the people in front did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2205"><a name="pos2205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> As you communicated through shouting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2206"><a name="pos2206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes that was the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2207"><a name="pos2207"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2208"><a name="pos2208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When Mr Mbatha told you that there was going to be a meeting on the 28th, was that an order, or was that merely a request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2209"><a name="pos2209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> It was a request because we were requested by the King to listen to his wishes and also the things that were requested from the Pretoria, the Government, and we wanted to find out as to how - what came out from the meetings in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2210"><a name="pos2210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you didn't go to work on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2211"><a name="pos2211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes I didn't go to work on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2212"><a name="pos2212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you feel that you were compelled to attend this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2213"><a name="pos2213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I wasn't compelled because being compelled, it means someone have to tell you to do something that you wouldn't like to do.  However, I also wish that I'll become part of what the King was going to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2214"><a name="pos2214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand.  Did you pay your own trainfare or was that paid for you by somebody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2215"><a name="pos2215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I won't know exactly who paid.  We were told by the leaders or the Indunas that we will travel by train, we didn't know who was supposed to pay for the fare.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2216"><a name="pos2216"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> To your own knowledge Mr Mhlaba, it is true that all the people who were getting into the train, they didn't pay for themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2217"><a name="pos2217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2218"><a name="pos2218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you very much.  Are there any further questions you wish to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2219"><a name="pos2219"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> There's no questions that arise from the Committee's questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2220"><a name="pos2220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Good, thank you very much.  Yes thank you, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2221"><a name="pos2221"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line2222"><a name="pos2222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes well now as I understand the position there are going to be no further witnesses in this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2223"><a name="pos2223"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Chair I would like to indicate that on behalf of the objectors for whom I appear there are no further witnesses.  I've also been requested by Ms van der Westhuizen who is not present, to also indicate that on her behalf there's no further witnesses to be called by the objectors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2224"><a name="pos2224"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairman, as I've indicated yesterday, we've got no further witnesses to call.  However, as I've also indicated yesterday, that there is a number, it's only four pages of the ballistic expert evidence which I wish to hand up to the Honourable Chairman and Honourable Members of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2225"><a name="pos2225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2226"><a name="pos2226"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Unfortunately the memo that I drafted had not been typed by the time we left this morning.  However, I would only like then to point out that the three or four major things appearing in this four pages for the benefit of the Committee.  The first is that on page 7267 from line 20 to the bottom thereof, it appears that the witness testified that 38 AK47 shots were fired from the south-western corner of Shell House.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2227"><a name="pos2227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2228"><a name="pos2228"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> The second is, which has already been canvassed and accepted by the applicants, that no shots were fired in the direction of the south-western corner of Shell House.  That appears on 7268 from approximately line 19 to the bottom thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2229"><a name="pos2229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2230"><a name="pos2230"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> And the third thing that appears on page 7269 from the top of the page up to approximately line 15, is that no shots were fired from the position where the people laid down that was injured at the corner there.  There were no shots fired from that position.  You referred to the sketch-plan which was already handed it, it will be noted that the blue circle from where the firing took place was actually not from that particular corner but in the middle of the street some distance away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2231"><a name="pos2231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2232"><a name="pos2232"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Then we've go no further questions, I have no further witnesses to call Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2233"><a name="pos2233"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thanks.  Off-hand I can't recall what Exhibit this report, the ballistics report is.  Is there anybody who remembers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2234"><a name="pos2234"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It's part of one of the "C's" under "B".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2235"><a name="pos2235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll just have to find - just in case we don't let this be Exhibit F.  Yes, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2236"><a name="pos2236"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I think we can just mark it Exhibit F, maybe that would be ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2237"><a name="pos2237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, this will go in as Exhibit F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2238"><a name="pos2238"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson just for the record, and I'm not going to burden the Committee now with a ballistics argument, we don't agree with some of the submissions, in particular the final submission made by my learned friend about the circle, but we will deal with it in argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2239"><a name="pos2239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, quite understandably.  He's giving you the purpose for which these pages are being handed to us from his point of view.  We understand, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2240"><a name="pos2240"></a>	Now I think we should finalise one or two things, and that is we would welcome comprehensive written argument from counsel involved in this matter and as I have indicated earlier this morning, because of the burden that this Committee carries, we would appreciate it if that is done within 10 days from today.  May I suggest that you please don't wait until you get the transcript of the remainder of the evidence, you can start doing your work, you know, now as it where, and in the hope that you'd be able to finish and let us have your heads within 10 days.  Mr Tipp that's quite clear isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2241"><a name="pos2241"></a><span class="speaker">MR TIPP:</span> Mr Chairman that's perfectly clear and we will ensure that our heads are completed within that period.  It may be that once we receive the responses from our learned friends, that we may need to file a short reply.  If that is necessary we will attend to it with every dispatch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2242"><a name="pos2242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well one advantage about making your heads available or interchanging heads, is that it can only make the work of the Commission that much easier, and it will be of greater assistance to us once we have considered the replies, if there are any need for replies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2243"><a name="pos2243"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Chair, may I similarly indicate the moment Mr Tipp and his team's argument is available, I would perhaps also like to comment on certain submissions made there and similarly I've agreed with Mr Tipp the moment his have become available I'll supplement the heads that have already been done by that time with whatever argument needs to be presented.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2244"><a name="pos2244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2245"><a name="pos2245"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> A similar arrangement has been made between me and Mr Tipp as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2246"><a name="pos2246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2247"><a name="pos2247"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> Mr Chair, from a logistics point of view, my attorney of record has just asked me to make sure that we dispatch it to the right address, is it going to the Cape Town address or where is it supposed to be going?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2248"><a name="pos2248"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No the administration of the Amnesty Committee is in Cape Town and it should go to the Executive Secretary of the Amnesty Committee please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2249"><a name="pos2249"></a><span class="speaker">MR DORFLING:</span> I thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2250"><a name="pos2250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  It remains for me to thank all of you for having assisted us with this inquiry.  Things have moved much more smoothly than they might otherwise have.  Thank you very much.  I come to the conclusion of these hearings and we adjourn.</p>
