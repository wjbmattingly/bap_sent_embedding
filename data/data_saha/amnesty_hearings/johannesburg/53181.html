<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  You are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, that would conclude my applications for the day.  May I be excused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I just want to find out if Mr Steenkamp can get hold of you at any time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> I can Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Pardon Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am finding out if Mr Steenkamp can contact you at any time.  You are excused as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't want to have the last word, but I have consulted and spoken to all my colleagues, including Mr Shane, detailing in an attempt to have enough information to prepare the roll for the next week, I have a very clear idea at this moment which cases are going to be heard and which are not going to be heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>	There is unfortunate certain matters which all my learned colleagues still have to be in a position to consult, they still have to meet certain applicants.  At this moment, this is including Mr Sanje Makanjee, who is not here - well, he is here today, but he didn't appear today, which is about, I would guess about eight to nine matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>	My suggestion to you Mr Chairman, that on Monday I can just put on record that Mr Lawly Shane informed me just now, that he will be only available and ready to continue next week, which will probably be Monday or some time next week, he was not in a position to put a date or a time exactly when he will be ready.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>	There is however, certain other matters that we can start with on Monday, which my colleagues have prepared already.  I would suggest for the rest of the week Mr Chairman, there is no hearable or matters that is ready for today and I would suggest that we continue with this hearing and with the roll, on Monday if that suits you.  Obviously we are in your hands, Mr Chairman.  Thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we then have to adjourn till Monday morning, nine o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
