At that stage we waited for quite a few minutes, that is myself and Vusi, and when there was relative quiet we proceeded to the gate.  As we peeped through the gate we saw a large group of people who had an assortment of weapons.  They had assegai's, knobkierries, pangas and they were proceeding towards the gate.  As they were coming towards the gate we tried to retreat, that is myself and Vusi.  These people pushed this gate forcefully, that is when I started to cock the gun that I had in my possession.  As I cocked the gun they continued to push the gate forcefully and the gate sort of opened slightly, I started shooting when I realised that they were pushing the gate open and when I fired my gun they ran away from the gate, they proceeded towards the pavement and they got scattered.  We continued to retreat whilst at the same time cocking my gun and I was still cocking my gun I could hear there was gunfire now, an exchange of gunfire outside.\n\tAs that continued I saw one of the street police as well as another policeman who formed some sort of a blockade at the gate and they faced the opposite building and they also took out their guns.  I decided that I was not going to go back towards the gate.  \n\tThe gunfire continued up to such a stage that there was relative quiet and there was another traffic cop as well as a policeman.  I waited for quite some time ... (intervention)",

We have at this point in time got difficulty in locating him.  \n\tAs far as Mr Stevens is concerned, Mr Stevens is currently overseas and he'll only be returning on the 23rd of June this year.
