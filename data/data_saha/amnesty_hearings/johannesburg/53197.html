<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Ms Nhlayisi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  The applicant's name is Lucky Themba Buthelezi.  His application appears on page 88, application number AM7563/97.  The applicant is bringing an application for amnesty for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, murders for undetermined number of people, and attempted murders for undetermined number of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Buthelezi, which language would you prefer to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">LUCKY THEMBA BUTHELEZI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Be seated.  Mr Buthelezi, I see you are dressed in prison clothes.  Are you serving a sentence at the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I am serving a sentence for another incident, not the ones that I am applying amnesty for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS NHLAYISI:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Buthelezi, you were a member of the SDU in Skosana Section, Katlehong, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> When did you join the SDUs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> In 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> Who was your Commander at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Comrade Mqoma and Mathule Mtabela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> Were they Commanders at the same time, or was it Mqoma first and then at a later stage it became Mathule Mtabela, what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Mqoma was my Commander first, and then Mathule later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> In your application form, you are mentioning an incident that took place at Buyafuthi Hostel.  Could you tell the Committee when did this incident take place, in which year was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I can.  It was in 1993, if I remember, I think it was in April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>	Commander Mqoma received a telephone call from Radebe Section.  They were complaining that IFP members are attacking them.  Mqoma called us from our bases at Skosana Section.  He told us that people were being attacked at Radebe Section and we were supposed to go and help the community there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>	We left, it was myself, Commander Mqoma, Mathule Mtabela and comrade Sitaba.  On our way to Radebe, Stability Units stopped us, but we tried to escape.  We went back where we came from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>	We left the weapons there at our base.  We tried to go back to the township, to Radebe Section where the incident had occurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>	When we arrived there, we found out two people were injured, three were injured and two were killed.  We came together with the community of Radebe and some people from Tokoza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> Before you proceed, on your arrival at Radebe Section, when you found that two people were dead and three were injured, was the fight between the IFP and the members of your Self Defence Units, still going on, or  the IFP members had left at that stage, what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> If you could please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> You said you arrived at Radebe to find that two people were dead, three were injured.  What was going on at that stage?  Was the shooting between the IFP members and the Self Defence Unit in Radebe still going on at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, IFP were attacking the community in Radebe Section.  They were the ones who were attacking the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>	When these three people were taken to hospital, we got together, we had a meeting as SDU from Radebe and Tokoza and Skosana members.  We decided that the following day we were supposed to attack them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>	We decided that we were going to launch the attack in the morning the next day.  We left Radebe, we entered Tokoza, we came from Unit F.  We were 17 if I remember very well.  Just before we arrived at the place, my Commander told me that I was the one who was supposed to shoot because there were IFP members at the gate of the hostel.  I don't know if they ere guarding the place  or what, but there was a fire there and we were waiting there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>	The person who gave me the command was comrade Mathule.  He said I was the one who was supposed to shoot those people.  I started crawling towards the gate where these people were standing.  I started shooting.  I think I shot about 32 bullets from my AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> Do you know whether any people were killed in this incident, when you fired at this group of people that you found at the gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you answer that question, were you the only one that discharged the firearm there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> I didn't get that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you the only one that discharged firearms there in that operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, I was the only one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Do you know when you fired shots, whether anybody was killed as a result of you firing some shots at that group of people that you found standing at the gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No, I don't know, but I have seen others falling down and some were running away.  Therefore I don't know whether some people died or not.  I shot about 32 rounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>	Some ran away and some fell down.  After that, I took a cover and I went back to the SDU members who were there, and we went back to Radebe Section and we dismissed from there, we went back to our respective areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> You are also not in a position to tell this Committee how many people fell on the ground as you were shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know if anybody died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I don't know for sure, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>	When I was shooting at this group of people, I was at a distance.  I saw them because they had a fire there around, there where they were standing.  Yes, I was pointing at them and some of them fell and some ran away.  I don't know whether they died or they just got injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> Because you do not know whether people died or were injured in that incident, but because you saw people falling down, you are now applying for amnesty for murder, for an undetermined number of people and attempted murder, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> You are also applying for amnesty for possessing an unlicensed firearm and ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I have nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS NHLAYISI</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> No questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In view of the fact that we have not been provided with evidence of any depth, what is the position about the application in respect of murder because murder by definition requires someone to die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>	Would it not be more prudent to amend the application to that of attempted murder of an undetermined number of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> I think that will be appropriate in the circumstances Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you Chair.  There were 17 of you who went to Buyafuthi Hostel that morning.  It was Buyafuthi, wasn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> What did the other 16 do while you executed the actual shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> They were protecting me, they were taking cover to protect me - if I was in danger, they were going to come for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So the other 16 were armed as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But not one of them fired any shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No one fired any shot because the order was issued to me directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  This Buyafuthi Hostel, we have had evidence of it being attacked, I think with the assistance of a casper?  Do you know about that?  It may have been a different incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this in fact another incident that you testified on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes, it is a different incident, it is not the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did your incident occur first or the other one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> My incident occurred first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  You are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS NHLAYISI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, that concludes my role.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Steenkamp, is that all that we can do today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, just for record purposes, the last applicant Zakwe Thambiso, that is the client of Mr Vusi Sibeko, the applicant is available, he is here now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>	I am informed that his wife is in hospital with an urgent position.   That is why he was late.  Unfortunately the position is still urgent and there is a request if you would allow it, if you would indulge it Mr Chairman, that this matter can stand down till tomorrow morning, that we can have a final position on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the circumstances we have to stand it down till tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>	By my count, we have four matters outstanding for tomorrow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, it is actually only three matters, because one matter was removed from the roll, that is the matter of Moloi and then the other matter was withdrawn by Mr Sibeko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>	It is only, basically three matters standing down till tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I hope we are in a position to - how to be able to give judgments in matters that we are able to give so, and probably most of the matters heard this week on Friday morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>	Those who are interested in the decisions can come on Friday morning, although we will listen to the other applications tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, if I may remind there is a position about, I understand a meeting on Friday.</p>
