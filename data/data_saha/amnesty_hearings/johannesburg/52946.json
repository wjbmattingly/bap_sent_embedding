But of course when we do these matters we always come up with something new.  Mr Chairperson as I indicated, also the applicant indicated that these members, these people who were involved were not members of the PAC.  Though, Mr Chairperson, you asked yourself through your Advocate Motata, you asked specifically how much was expected but it did not come up how much they expected but they ended up getting R7000.  But he indicated that he felt that the share he was going to get was going to be enough but we're not sure what enough means because we don't know how much, how they calculated it and how did they arrive that they expect so much amount and during the sharing of the amount, so he will get so much.  What I'm trying to say Mr Chairperson is that though itself is unique and unusual as I indicated I'm first to concede, definitely the amount which was going to be handed over to APLA, if it was going to be handed over, was going to be negligible, taking into account the amount which was found after the whole mission aborted, almost R900 as the Honourable Mr Chairperson calculated.\n\tMr Chairperson, I don't want to elaborate but definitely I'm in a tight corner when it comes to ...(intervention)",

If one member happened to be AWB or an MK cadre, he could also come and say well I was doing it for the organisation because objectively, when one looks at it, it's just a gang of eight people.  When the applicant's tried, well from the information we've got, it was never brought up that any political motive at all, it comes for the first time in this application and then that raises the question which I asked him, you know why if it's for the APLA or PAC, why go to somebody in a different organisation at the time, you know, when you can get all the money instead of one eighth?",
