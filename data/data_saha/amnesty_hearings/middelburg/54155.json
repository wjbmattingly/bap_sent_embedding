During my arrival at the police station, with the orders that I gave to the members of that unit, we got to the police station.  It was around 11 o'clock - midnight, or 23H00 where one member who was supposed to go through to the police station in the charge office was shot.  I jumped over the fence at the back of the police station.  During that time I heard a shot which was a pistol shot and I started becoming aware that no, there's somebody firing and during that time the lights of the police station was off because all my members were not having pistols, they were using machine guns, semi-machine guns and machine guns.  Then I ran straight to the charge office. I found one of my members lying in front of the charge office.  So then I started firing inside the charge office because one of my members was lying down who was shot.  During that time there was an exchange of fire and I called one member who was a driver because the vehicle was parked in front of the police station at the gate to cover me up because I was experiencing some shots again.\n\tUnfortunately, I didn't even manage to pull off with my member who was shot.  Then the member who was driving was shot on the hands again.  He shouted to me, he said \"I was shot\".  Then I kept on firing alone and then during that time there was no more, any firing from the police station when I retreated.  I took the gentleman who was the driver to the vehicle.

That shot, it sounded like a pistol and I said no, my members doesn't have any pistols as far as I know.  We had some semi-machine guns and a machine gun.  Then I move round the building, I go straight, I find while I approached the entrance, I find that my member is lying next to the door.  So I realised that this person was shot.

The family's position is that they are not opposing but they would like the Commission to compensate them in some way.  Mr Alfred Mbata indicated that when the applicant intended to destroy the system, he did not only destroy the system, it destroyed his family because as a family they depended on Mr Mbata, he was their breadwinner, he supported them.  Without him they've really struggled and Mr Mbata left a son who is now 18 years old.  The mother is not working and they're using their pensions to support this child.  That is all Chairperson.",

We've been advised that one applicant is at Witbank, the second one is at Baviaansport in Pretoria and the third one is at Barberton.
