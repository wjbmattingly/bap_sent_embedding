<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> May Mr Skosana be sworn in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Skosana, just remain standing.  You are Charles Michael Skosana, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHARLES MICHAEL SKOSANA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  You may sit down.  Yes, Mr Richard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> Mr Skosana, in and during the end of 1990 and the early part of 1991, were you affiliated to any particular political party or organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, I was a supporter of a political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> If so, which one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> The ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you a member or a supporter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> A supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Can I just suggest, maybe he brings the microphone a little bit closer to him.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How did you participate in the activities of the ANC, what did you do to show your support?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I was following the ANC because I used to attend rallies and meetings and what was said in those meetings, I used to follow that.  That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now were you also born and educated and reared at Pieterskraal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You have heard the evidence of the previous applicants about where and what is Pieterskraal, and do you confirm what they are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You also heard the evidence of the previous applicants, concerning what is a moloi, ngaka, a sangoma, do you confirm what they say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You personally, do you believe in witchcraft?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> On those days, I used to believe that there is witchcraft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now I have asked many questions about what the ANC Youth at the time thought should happen to impimpi's and moloi's.  At that time, is that what you thought, the same as your previous applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Informers and witches were the targets of being burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Why were they to be burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Because they were not the people accepted in the community.  They were dividing the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When did you personally first become aware of Emma Mtsweni and the fact that she was talking of witchcraft?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I heard for the first time in the last meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When you say the last meeting, which meeting was that?  Where was that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> The meeting was in a school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What stage of that meeting did you join the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Towards the end because I was from work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> At what time of the day was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> At about six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now from whom did you - when you arrived at the meeting, what did you do to find out what was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> When I arrived, it was the time when the cars were on their way to fetch the deceased from her home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you go with the cars to fetch the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> No, I didn't, I was left in the school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Where did you go next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> We waited for them until they came back, where they went to fetch the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> While you were waiting, what did you learn, what was happening, why did they need to fetch Emma Mtsweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> When they left for the deceased's home, they didn't come back to the school, they went to Vaalbank and when they came back to the school, that is when they were with her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> While you were waiting at the school, did you talk to people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> There were no talks, but there were singing and chanting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What was the singing and chanting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> They were singing about Thambo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did they sing about impimpi's and moloi's and witches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> When they came back from Vaalbank, that is when they started singing about impimpi's and witches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When they came back from Vaalbank, for how long were you still at the school before you went somewhere else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> We stayed there until at about eight o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> They came back from Vaalbank and then you all left as you have heard, for the mountain.  From the time they came back from Vaalbank to the time you left for the mountain, how much time passed, was it one hour, five minutes, 15, 20 minutes, approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> When they came back, they stopped at the gate and they just said they cannot discuss this matter in the school, because they had passed Police stations, therefore we should go to the mountain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, did you go to the mountain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Why did you go to the mountain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I had to go together with the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Why did you have to go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I was also part of the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, do you know why they were taking Emma to the mountain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Emma was questioned about witchcraft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How did you go to the mountain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> We were following the cars behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now at the mountain,w hat did you see happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> She was taken out of the car, July took a five litre container and gave it to Victor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Sorry, who took a five litre container?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> July.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> July?  Thank you.  What did Victor do with that container?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> He took Emma into a certain bush and that is when we all followed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Maybe if you can explain what you mean by (indistinct), what structure is that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> It is a forest, a bush like place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Maybe let me just finish what I wanted to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> We have never heard from these other applicants, was she, that is Emma, was she walking on her own, was she maybe fastened, what was the position with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> As she was alighting from the car, she wasn't fastened, she had her blanket in her arm and Victor took her and pushed her inside the forest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What was her physical condition, was she too old or was she able just to walk normally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> She wasn't an elderly, but she was aged, even though she wasn't that much old, I can approximate to 50 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Richard.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did she go with the comrades voluntarily?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I don't think she came willingly because as she was questioned in that forest as to whether she had done this, she said yes, but she wasn't the only one, there was someone also involved, his name is Nkabinde Mahlangu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you, were you near when she was questioned, could you hear what was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, I was closer because I wanted to listen and find out if the allegations were true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What did you hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> She answered and the comrades said Mahlangu was also supposed to be fetched in order for him to be questioned, because the allegations were that she had got the muti from Mahlangu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  What happened when she said what she said, what happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> July had already gone back and also Mahlangu's son had left with a group of comrades to fetch his father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What happened to Emma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> At that time, a petrol was being poured over her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Who was pouring the petrol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Victor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Anyone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Richard Skosana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Anyone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Janya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> After they had poured the petrol, what happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> We heard the roaring of cars and we also saw lights and Speelman was still busy pouring the petrol and Jan asked me and said "Charles, don't you have a match" and I said "yes, I do have", and then he said light, for me to light the body, so I did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So you lit the match that set her on fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, at page 36 of the bundle, paragraph 9(4) you say in reply to the question "nature and particulars of the act for which you apply for amnesty"</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>"... the comrades were in charge of the area at that time and they accused the deceased of killing the parents of their fellow comrade."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>	Whose parents did they accuse her of killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> July Mtsweni and Speelman Mtsweni's parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now lower down you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>"... the deceased and the family were the supporters of Mbokodo which was an opponent of the UDF".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>	What is Mbokodo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, it was so.  She was an enemy of the comrades because they were killing comrades and we were scared that we were going to die one by one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What does the word Mbokodo mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Mbokodo is a person like an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just read the previous paragraph as well before you go that that one, you say that this was during the violence in the area that was opposing the previous government and Mbokodo, right?  What was Mbokodo, was it an organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, it was an organisation that was fighting comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Who ran this organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Mbokodo was run by businessmen and they were also working with whites who owned companies and also there were informers among the Mbokodo informing on different people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How did you know that she was a member of this organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I know her that way.  I am saying that because members of the Mbokodo used to go to her house and they were doing this during the night, they were never there during the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I think as with the previous case, I will ask the witness to read paragraphs 10(a) and 10(b).  Are you able to read?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Has he written it?  Just ask him, just lay the basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Sorry, did you write what I am saying here in paragraphs 10(a) and 10(b), is that your handwriting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Somebody helped me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Can you read what is written there or shall I read it to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Would you please read it for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  There is a question which asks "please state the political objective sought to be achieved", your answer there was</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>"... law and order was achieved.  People should know that the killing of others by means of witchcraft, would not be tolerated.  More specifically when they killed the next-of-kin of the comrades, this affects the soldiers of the liberation struggle."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>	And then the next paragraph asks the question "your justification for regarding such  acts, omissions or offences as associated with a political objective?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>	Is the Translator in step with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Your answer</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>"... any person affecting the family of a comrade would make himself/herself potentially target of the comrade.  The family whose children have dedicated themselves, the family whose are members of the UDF, who were fighting for the struggle are always protected by UDF.  No matter who is touching them, we had a slogan that says an injury to one is an injury to all.  Therefore the comrade took a decision after the death of my parents, to avenge their death.  I was arrested before the deceased was killed.  The Police arrested me because of my political activities.  The leadership of the region took the family's decision at a meeting at the Egukhanyeni  Primary School, therefore I request help, forgiveness."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>	Do you remember that being written?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, I do remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> The person who helped you to write that, was that a lawyer or if not a lawyer, who was the person who helped you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> It was a lawyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And where did the lawyer come to see you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I think he was from the Minister of Justice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you in jail at the time?  Do you remember his or her name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I think I do remember his name, his last name is Mashishi, I don't remember his first name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Tell me, did he explain the meanings of the questions before you spoke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, he was explaining to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did he suggest what answers you should give or did you just tell him what your answer was after you understood the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I was telling him and then he was writing down and later he was reading it to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So are you happy that what I have read, is what you said and he wrote down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, my next question then is very straight forward and simple, how do you think that the killing of Emma Mtsweni assisted the ANC struggle for liberation of South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Emma's death showed that the Youth can manage to develop the country and also the fact that the youth can educate themselves because they were not concentrating on school, they were concentrating on crimes and stealing goods from other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, there on the side of the mountain, did you see any ANC leaders or UDF leaders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> No, there were no UDF members, there were ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did any of them give any instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> What they said was that a witch is someone to be burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What was your reaction to that instruction, did you agree with it or disagree with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I agreed with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Who were those leaders who gave those instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Skosh and others, and I couldn't see others properly, but these ones were close by.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, just whilst you are mentioning names, what about Mashiane whose name you mentioned at page 46?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Mashiane is a chief in Pieterskraal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Where was Mashiane that day, that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> When this happened, it was after a meeting which I arrived just after it had finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry Mr Richard, are you going to ask him a question on something else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Go ahead please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Okay.  Mashiane, was he a member of the ANC because that is what you say at page 46?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Mashiane was working hand in hand with the chief Mabhoko.  He knew about the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, but is it correct that he gave an order as an ANC leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> The saying that a witch is someone to be killed, an impimpi to be killed ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> May I ask you this question?  In the bundle there are a number of applications for amnesty, the first one which ends at page 37 was signed by you in Pretoria on the 21st of November 1996 and then later on, at pages 38 to 41 we have another one, signed on the 6th of May 1996 and then on page  42 through to 48, we have another one signed on the 9th of October 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>	Why did you complete so many application forms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I received forms, they were in my name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Who brought those forms to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> They were posted to the prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You take the one, November 1996, did you tell Mr Mashishi that you had completed other forms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, I did.  I explained to him that I had already filled other application forms and I had already sent them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How did Mr Mashishi come to see you, did you ask him to come or did he come without any arrangements, did somebody send him to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I telephoned him to come and help me in prison and I told him I had a problem and he came to see me.  He asked me if I had filled in the indemnity forms and I told him "yes", and he told me he was going to bring other forms because it may happen that the first one which I filled, was not, never reached the destination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did Mr Mashishi say he should get the other forms that you had filled in and have a look at them before completing any more forms or did he just proceed to complete that one dated November 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I had already sent other forms and I explained to him and he said to me probably they were not received, it is better for me to fill in other forms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you ask him to explain why certain questions were asked  and did he explain the meaning of the questions, why it was being asked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Richard, where is this taking us to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is this taking us to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> My last question is which form do you stand by, a contradiction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, he hasn't completed any of these things.  You can see from his signature he can hardly write.  Mr Skosana, did you complete any of these forms in your own handwriting, did you write any form, or did other people always help to you complete these things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> They were helping me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So he hasn't completed any of these forms, so where does it take us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> One more question.  So you were happy with the last form you completed with Mr Mashishi and that is your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now in Mashishi's form there is a question which says "did you benefit in any way" and your answer was</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>"... yes, our aim has been done, therefore we benefitted."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>	Did that mean that you got any monetary benefit or financial benefit or privileges or did you just win the struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I benefitted in the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I believe I have canvassed this in shorthand and if I continue, I am asking him to repeat evidence that is incorporated by referring to the others.  I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Richard.  Mr Mokoena, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> No questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MOKOENA</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mokoena.  Ms Mtanga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS MTANGA:</span> I have one question Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Mr Skosana, will I be correct to say the reason that you link the death of Emma Mtsweni to the ANC's political struggle, it is because - I am saying will I be correct to say that the reason that you link the death of Emma Mtsweni to the ANC's political struggle is because the deaths of the parents of the comrades affected the welfare of the comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Is there another reason apart from this, that you would say was the reason why you killed, why she was killed by yourself and other comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, we killed her because she wasn't supposed to do that, because an injury to one is an injury to all.  This affected us, it affected the people who were not entirely involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Tell me what would be the situation where a person, let's assume in this case, Emma had beaten up the parents of July and Ernest Mtsweni, would the comrades have been involved in this instance to kill her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> If you have beaten someone, there is a difference in beating and killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> What would happen if she had beaten them to death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> What she did was evil because she had killed and she killed two people, we killed her because we were also preventing her from killing us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> If she had beaten them to death, Mr Skosana, what would you and the organisation have done about her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> We were going to sit down with her because we were going to understand that an accident doesn't always happen and an accident is something that happens to everyone.  One cannot run away from that.  I may just take a walk and meet an accident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> I am not saying they would have had an accident, I am saying she would have beaten them up to death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Assume she wasn't aged, she was a very strong woman and she would just beat these two people to death, just imagine that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> It means she was also going to be beaten to death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Can I conclude for you the reason for you to kill her in this situation is because she would have caused the death of your fellow comrades, and therefore affected your fellow comrades' welfare?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> I have no further questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS MTANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Ms Mtanga.  The fact that she was apparently associated with Mbokodo, did that play any role in the action that was taken against her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Her witchcraft was the reason she was killed and also that she was part of the organisation which we opposed.    In meetings we were told that we were opposing this other organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that Mbokodo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Any other questions from the Panel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Tell me, at the mountain was she confronted about the fact that she was a supporter of Mbokodo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> No, she was not questioned anything about her association with Mbokodo, because at the mountain it was out of control.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When did you become aware for the first time that she was a member of Mbokodo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Members of Mbokodo used to go to her home at night, they never went there during the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I suppose from what  you are saying, you must have seen these members of Mbokodo coming to her house at night, when was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I used to see them all the time, and their cars, parked outside her yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Who were these people from Mbokodo who were coming to her house at night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> They were people from Ndebele, people who came after the violence in 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What did you do with that information when you became aware that she had this association with members of Mbokodo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> We watched her and the fact that her children never attended any of the meetings and we were just watching that her members do not kill our members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You say you were watching her, who was that, who are you referring to when you say "we were watching her", yourself and who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was it just yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I raised this in a meeting and it was said that one of her children should join our organisation so that we know what is going on within the Mbokodo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You say you raised it at a meeting, was anyone of your co-applicants present at that meeting, where you raised this thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Her association as you said, with Mbokodo, was it one of the reasons why she was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> No, that is not.  I knew this and so she was just my enemy because of this fact because I hated Mbokodo members.  Whenever you come across them, they would chase you at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, but tell me at that time would it not, if a person associated with such a body, the Mbokodo, which was opposed to the liberation struggle, wouldn't that have been something everyone would know in the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> The community knew about the fact that she had associated herself with Mbokodo, but the community didn't know what time of the day the Mbokodo members were coming to her house, but one would see Mbokodo's cars parked outside her house and if you were walking nearby, you would be chased away, not knowing who the people were who were chasing you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I don't know, if I follow the evidence correctly here, you seem to be the only one who claims that the deceased had an association with the Mbokodo?  Why would the other applicants not mention such a thing, that the deceased had this association with the Mbokodo which was seen as a political enemy in that struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I was her neighbour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> If the deceased had not made this confession that she was a witch, would she still have been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> No, she wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> She was killed only because of the so-called confession that she made that she was a witch, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mr Mahlangu whom she implicated, was that person known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> I first heard of Mahlangu Nkabinde and I couldn't understand why one person had two surnames.  I heard it for the first time that he was Mahlangu Nkabinde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What did you know about the person concerned,t his Mahlangu?  Did you know if he was a person of any political association?  Did you know if he had any skill or expertise to use muti?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> No, the first time I heard about Mahlangu is when she made the confession that Mahlangu gave her the muti to kill the parents of July and Speelman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you very much.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you.  Mr Skosana, I see on page 35 you say you were a supporter of the Intandwe Isizwe Party which was under the ANC.  Was Intandwe Isizwe Party active in your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Yes, it was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> On page 36, on paragraph, sub-paragraph 4, the second paragraph thereof you said</p>

<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>	was the conflict between Intandwe Isizwe party on the one hand and Mbokodo on the other hand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> There were conflicts between Mbokodo and Intandwe Isizwe and the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And then on page 38 you say you were a member of the Pieterskraal Civic Organisation which was an affiliate of SANCO, is that the information you gave to the person who was assisting you to complete the form?</p>

<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Then on page 40 you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>"... the Civic Organisation instructed that the area of Pieterskraal had a problem of witchcraft and which had to be eradicated."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>	At what stage did this Civic Organisation take such a decision, when was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> It started in 1988, that is when they started resolving the witchcraft problem, they instructed that the witches should leave the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> On page 37 you mention Masoldier, who was Masoldier, what were his full names?  Page 37, paragraph 11(a)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR SKOSANA:</span> Masoldier is one of the accused in this case, but he has then deceased.</p>

<blockquote class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>"... any person who associated himself or herself with any act or admission committed for the purposes referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) and (f) ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>	When we look at the killing of Emma Mtsweni, I believe it has been established that on the basis that I have argued in the previous matter, she was bona fide and honestly perceived by the applicants to be an opponent of the ANC and that her killing would achieve the political objective of furthering the ANC's objectives and ideals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>	We have five witnesses who gave coherent evidence to the fact that she was identified as a witch or moloi, we have it before us that if a person is pointed out to be a witch or a moloi, there is very little that that individual can do about it.  The perception then by the applicants was that for that reason and that reason alone, she was seen to be the equivalent of an impimpi and I could argue further as I did last night, a Security Force personnel, an apartheid counsellor and therefore within the framework she became a legitimate objective of an attack as contemplated by this Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>	For those reasons I believe and submit that subsection (1)(b) of Section 20 has also been complied with.  The only potential exception to my argument might be the first person, the first applicant to give evidence today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>	There he has said that whether or not the youth of the area, the comrades had become involved, he might have done an act.  However, I believe his evidence needs to be seen in the context of that particular time.  As the last applicant has said, there was perceived to be a witchcraft problem in that area which is corroborated by the various reports that we had reference to.  It was perceived that the killing of witches would achieve both the subjective and political objective and when I refer to subsection (g) of subsection 20(2), I have no difficulty in making the submission that the first applicant was a person who associated himself with the acts which fall within the definition of (2)(a) and as read with 20(1)(b).</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>	I can argue at length, but I believe that in view of the time, I should make the offer that I made yesterday, if the Committee would like it, I would prepare written Heads with pleasure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you should just have your say now.  Your clients are in custody, we don't have the luxury of Heads or argument in these matters any more, unless it is really compelling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I believe that the argument that I have outlined is in summary that the killing of Emma Mtsweni was an act committed with a political purpose, by persons who associated themselves with the aims and objectives of the ANC at the time, they have made a full disclosure of all relevant facts and they have complied with the requirements of the Act of Parliament and in the circumstances, are entitled to an amnesty for the murder of Emma Mtsweni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Mr Mokoena?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> No submission Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Ms Mtanga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA IN ARGUMENT:</span> Chairperson, I will be very brief.  It is my submission that the killing of Emma Mtsweni arose from a family dispute.  This can be referred from the evidence, or the applications of the three Mtsweni's.  I will refer the Committee to page 2 of the bundle, that is the application of July Mtsweni, paragraph 9, subsection (a)(iv), he states there</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>"... this was a family discussion and it was upon my grandma.  I left the meeting still on progress and when I reached home, I was told that the deceased had been burnt."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>	If this is read together with the applications of Ernest and Phillip, on paragraph 9(a)(iv) of Ernest's application, page 13.  Phillip also utters a similar view, that it was a family matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it is common cause that it started off as a family matter, but it didn't end as a family matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> What appears from their evidence Chairperson, is that from the onset the fact that Emma was accused of bewitching their parents, politics were never involved in that situation, it was a family debacle, and it only, they lost control of the situation only when the comrades got involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, this thing only really started developing broader when the question of witchcraft surfaced and eventually when she confessed, then it was the end of the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Yes Chairperson, but the question is the family, the Mtsweni family, the witchcraft didn't arise when the comrades arrived.  At the initial family meeting, they were discussing the witchcraft issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and they didn't believe that, they never thought that she would be involved in that, and from the perspective of the family  members, that was really only confirmed when she admitted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> That is not so Chairperson.  When July Mtsweni testified, he indicated that at the time they went to fetch Emma from Vaalbank ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was suspicious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> He was already angry and suspicious that Emma was a witch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because she had apparently run away, and he wouldn't know why would she be acting like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Mr Chairperson, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the confirmation came out of her mouth eventually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> But then the argument will also follow that there is no evidence before the Committee that will, or the basis for the applicants to link the killing of their parents by Mtsweni, to the political struggle of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, she was killed by the ANC Youth League eventually?  They associate themselves with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Chairperson, it cannot be argued that all the offences committed by political organisations, will constitute political offences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Yes, and this is the situation here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is true.  No, we must look at the circumstances, but the fact of the matter is as I have said to you earlier, the way I understand this, it started off as a family matter, understandably so, because it concerned mother and father, and then eventually it grew into an issue which the ANC Youth League took an interest in because now it was no longer a family matter, it is matter that concerned the ANC, because here now was an indication that this person could have been one of the people that fell into the category of opponents?  That is why it grew into and eventually landed up as an ANC action where these family members were not even present at the scene?  She was attacked when they were back to deliver the van to the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Chairperson, that may be so, but the fact that it was taken over by the ANC Youth League, doesn't make it a political offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, no, no, I agree with you, we must look at the circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> That is so Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But it doesn't also not make it a political offence because it is a factor that comes into it, the fact that the attack was eventually taken over by the ANC, as you say quite correctly doesn't automatically mean it is a political offence, it could be a criminal matter, it could be a personal matter, they could have a personal grudge against this old lady.  But by the same token it doesn't make it not a political offence, so we must look at it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Yes, I agree with you Chairperson, but I would like to submit that perhaps the Committee should be careful in this witchcraft cases, especially in the areas of Mpumalanga and Northern Province.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Where witches were killed broadly by the Youth League or by the ANC as an organisation, and my argument is that should the Committee accept a situation where a person is just, because that person is killed by the ANC Youth League for being alleged to be a witch, then that should be, it can be perceived as a political offence, it could broaden or it will open the floodgates to a lot of cases which took place in this area and which had nothing to do with politics at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, no, I appreciate that, I appreciate that submission, that is why I said to you that that fact is not a decisive fact, we have to look at the case still.  But it is just hard to imagine why these people went about and killed the deceased, it doesn't look to have been any personal grudge or any bad blood, or anything personal vis-a-vis the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Chairperson, I would say the killing of Emma Mtsweni is in line with the material that we have received from the Commission of Enquiry and the hearing in the Mavhunga matter where it is said that at some point in the history of this province, the youth took over the killing of witches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question is why?  They say the reason for that is because these people were impeding the development of their organisation and by the same token, was obstructing the political struggle that they were engaged in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>	That is why I say to you, if you look at that, you have 200 people or 300 people there, the family members have left the scene, there is no indication that there was bad blood or a grudge or anything, vis-a-vis the deceased, and they are saying to us, that is the only evidence that is before us, that it was an action undertaken by the ANC Youth League where there leadership was present on the scene, one of the leaders accompanied the group that went to fetch the deceased where she was with her brother and they killed her in a typical political style killing, with a necklace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Chairperson, I would like to still argue that in this particular case where a person gets killed because she is a witch and she is alleged to affect the welfare of the youth in the area, the political link that is being created here, is very far fetched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry if I understand you correctly, are you saying that these ANC activists who participated in this incident, were actually used to settle a private dispute?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Chairperson, I would agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And this was just a purely criminal act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> This was a purely criminal act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It had nothing to do with politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Yes Chairperson, it had nothing to do with politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All of these people, 200 to 300 people were somehow persuaded to indulge in a totally criminal act against an innocent person, that they had no personal reason to harm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Chairperson, I find it difficult to agree that because 200 and 300 people mobilised themselves and attacked a person, then because of the numbers involved, we should sort of infer that because they were organised, then it must have been a political motive.  There are many instances in these areas where people are killed and they are being killed by a group of people, and it shouldn't be argued that because there was a mobilised crowd, then it was political.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it could have been a criminal gang, it could have been the Naughty Boys or whatever, but now we need material, we need evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>	The evidence before us suggests that this was a politically motivated matter, it wasn't a criminal matter.  If you are submitting that we must disregard that and we must actually find that these people are lying to us, that they were really a bunch of criminals who had gone to execute this lady for no reason, innocent victim ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> If the Committee is of the view that if an offence is carried out by, even if it was not initially in a political context, if by the fact that it is embraced by a political organisation, then it becomes political, then I have no, I have nothing else to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, you must, the point that I am making is that if you submit that it is not political, it is criminal, then you must persuade us in some or other way.  The obstacle that I am pointing out to you is that there is certain evidence placed in front of us, and nothing else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Well Chairperson, I will agree with you on that, because the family is not here to contradict what is said, and maybe point out to some other reason why Mrs Emma Mtsweni was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Of course it doesn't mean that because there is only one version before us, that we are forced to accept that version or accept it in its totality.  We are entitled to reject a version that is put before us which doesn't persuade us and doesn't satisfy us, and that is why I am saying you've got to actually put something that is compelling, before us, so that if you want us to make the finding that you are arguing for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Chairperson, it is difficult for me to do that because I don't have any material evidence that I can put before the Committee, except to argue that it is, it will be quite a dangerous thing for the Committee to accept the mere fact that the offence was embraced by a political organisation, then in the absence of any other evidence, then it qualifies as a politically motivated crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that is right, an uncritical acceptance just of that evidence, that is a failure of the duty that the Committee had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We have to be satisfied and in order to be able to be satisfied, we have to apply our minds and be persuaded in some way that this is indeed a politically motivated and not just as you are submitting, just a random act of violence  by a bunch of blood-thirsty youth who had nothing else to do on that night, but to attack the deceased?  If so, then they are not entitled to amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We have to bear that in mind, I am with you on that submission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Is it perhaps your submission that in that area witches were not legitimate targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Chairperson, witches were legitimate targets by the youth, particularly the ANC Youth League at that time, that is the evidence that we have from the material that we have, and we have also heard from these applicants and the applicants that we had yesterday.   However, I would like to refer the Committee to the argument of my learned friend in yesterday's matter where he said perhaps the Committee should make a distinction between a perception that is based on reasonable grounds in the logical sense and the perception that is based on the reasonable grounds in the cultural sense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>	With that one will have to look for evidence that creates the basis for the perception that this person was a witch and her witchcraft affected the political organisation and this must have a basis in the cultural sense of the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I understand that, we have to be satisfied at the very least, subjectively, these people first of all held the belief, the applicants, or the people that lived in that area, society, and secondly that objectively looking at the case, there was some grounds for bona fide believing that they were acting against a political opponent, because that is the requirement of the Act.  It must be an act bona fide in furtherance of a struggle against a political enemy.  There must at least first be the subjective belief which satisfies us and secondly, that is not the end of the story because if it is so unreasonable on the objective facts of the case, then of course we are entitled to find that there was no bona fides in the particular instance.  We have to look at both those two elements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Chairperson, I would like to end my submission of this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Ms Mtanga.  You do raise issues of importance.  Yes, Mr Richard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD IN REPLY:</span> My reply to my learned colleague is I must point out that the circumstances and context of this event was the struggle in 1990.  It was a period when as I argued last night, make the country ungovernable, was the crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>	The deceased by her confession, however it was obtained, established in the minds of the crowd and that is certainly the third, fourth and fifth applicants, that she was associated with witchcraft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>	We have argued the position of witches in the context of the time before.  They were perceived to be the enemy of the struggle.  My learned colleague then seems to create two categories - one is the Mtsweni family and that of the others.  Without labouring or repeating my previous argument, subsection 20(2)(f) speaks of any person who associates him or herself with an act committed within the meaning of subsection 20(1)(b) as read with 20(1)(2)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f).</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>	While it might well have been as has been pointed out at the initial stages of the transaction, that it was a family affair, as soon as the talk of witchery penetrated into the comrades' minds, it became a very public affair.  Whether and I believe the only one who might be affected by my learned colleague's argument is the first applicant, July ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Even that, I don't quite read subsection (g) as referring to a person in the position of the first applicant in these proceedings.  That seems to my mind to refer to people who don't fall into any of the categories which are spelt out there, a supporter, member of a political organisation or a liberation movement or a member of the Security Forces, those categories that are sketched in the earlier subsections of (20).  If, the way I understand subsection (g), if you have somebody who stands completely outside of those categories, he is not a supporter of any political organisation, he is not a member of any political organisation, he is not a member of the Security Forces, he is outside of the formal structures of the contending Forces in the political struggle, he stands completely outside of those categories, he can still quality for amnesty if he can show that he associated himself with an act committed by a member or a supporter of a political party organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>	But that applicant, if I understand his evidence correctly says, he puts himself in category (a), he says I am a supporter of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So he is not outside of the category?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Correct Chairperson, but he did make the statement which I did allude to earlier that even if the comrades had not been involved, he might have done something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it is just indicative of his subjective state of mind.  It is indicative of his view that it was justified to act against the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And clearly on the evidence before us, even if that was one of his points, a person may have more than one intention in their mind at one time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't the determining factor that he did associate himself with the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> That is my argument Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he expressly testified to that effect, he said "I wasn't there, I came back with the Police, but certainly I associate myself with what happened there".</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> With the political motive of the context and the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I am a supporter of the ANC so I fall into category A and my association makes it a common purpose, it is a crime that I have committed and there it seems to me that the matter rests.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> My second two points were the political nature of the offence, the evidence is overwhelming.  It certainly cannot be said to be far fetched.  Taking the various reports that we have available, plus the evidence of these applicants, taken in conjunction and the context of evidence in other matters, I don't see any reason to doubt or be suspicious or impute fabrication to these applicants that there was a political motive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>	Witches as I have already argued, were perceived to be the opponents, and that was the subjective and bona fide belief.  I don't want to re-argue other matters, so I am going to leave it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, the point that Ms Mtanga quite rightly makes is that that is not really where the matter ends, because we must also be satisfied that the conduct is bona fide.  So assume for example that the victim was a five year old girl, really totally harmless, then of course the objective looking at the facts in order to determine bona fides, of course will weigh more heavily against the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>	I think that is what she is referring to, that you have to actually go that second step as well, and you must look objectively and be satisfied that there were bona fides in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In this case we are not looking at a five year old girl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> We are looking at the age group of the typical witch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I thought I will just illustrate the argument that Ms Mtanga raises, which to my mind is a proper approach to the exercise that we must engage in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> My answer is that on the test of bona fides, there was nothing to repugnant to logic and reason in this matter, so as to come to the conclusion that it is not bona fide, it is male fide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Ms Mtanga argues that we are under duty  not to uncritically just accept everything at face value, that we have to actually apply our minds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> That is a valid point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think there is a difference between you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> No, that is a valid point.  And I believe on a critical examination of this evidence, in as much as there is an onus on an applicant in an amnesty application, the evidence is before the Commission to satisfy itself quite properly and critically that there was bona fides in the act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>	Again we are dealing with witchcraft, witchcraft is a subjective perception.  I believe the evidence is overwhelming that the perception of these applicants was that a witch was an enemy of the liberation struggle and hard as it might be, ten years after the event in a different context in time, to believe what happened then, at that time in the context of the struggle, a belief was both honest and bona fide and that is what the perception that the applicants acted with.  I rest.  To take it further means re-arguing this in other cases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we appreciate you not doing that Mr Richard. There are some other matters that we must still attend to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> That is why I tried to curtail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you very much.  That concludes the application.  As you have gathered from the discussion here at the end, that it is a matter that will have to be considered, it is a matter in which a decision cannot be given immediately, but the Panel will still even given the constraints that we operate under normally, logistically, we will endeavour to formulate a decision as quickly as the circumstances permit and we will then notify the parties once that decision is available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> As the Committee pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The decision is reserved.  Thank you very much.  These applicants can stand down at this stage, they would be excused.  There is one more applicant, Mr Tladi, who is accommodated in Pretoria and we would like to finalise that matter so that the Correctional Services who have gone to great difficulty to get to the venue here, are able to be released finally, because they wouldn't have any other person to actually deal with, once Mr Tladi's case is finalised, so we would like to really deal with that one and hopefully complete it as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I believe we can deal with it and complete with it tonight, it is not a long matter, Chairperson.  May I request the indulgence of a five minute adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, we will stand down just briefly, just a few minutes, just to re-arrange.  We will reconvene and deal with Mr Tladi's matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
