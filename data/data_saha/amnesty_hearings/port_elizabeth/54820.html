<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Mr Chairman, the legal representatives amongst themselves have agreed, subject to your approval, that the following witness should be Mr W A L du Toit.  Subsequently Mr De Kock, the technical people involved.  If that should meet with your approval, I will ask that we just adjourn for about five minutes, because the witnesses have to reassemble on that side for the ease of the interpreters.  So we will have to move to that side.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will adjourn for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Kemp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Mr Chairman, Kemp on behalf of the sixth applicant, Wybrandt du Toit.  We thank for the Committee for the indulgence. We will be initially referring the witness to volume 1 of the documents before the Committee.  Before I lead the evidence, Mr Chairman, you will note that during the adjournment, we have placed documents before you. It is simply a document in which we apply for a slight amendment to paragraph 9(a)(i) of the application for amendment, merely to extend the request for amnesty also to those crimes as set out in paragraph two of this notice.  It follows from the same incident and it is done for the sake of completeness, in line with that done by previous applicants in this hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	The witness is ready to take the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">WYBRANDT ANDREAS LODEWIKUS DU TOIT:</span> (Duly sworn, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR KEMP:</span> Mr Du Toit, you are the sixth applicant applying for amnesty in this incident.  I want to refer you to page 145 of Volume 1 of the documents before this Committee.  This is the amnesty application in terms of Section 80 of the Act, completed by you and handed in last year. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Will you look at this document, it ranges from page 145 to page 164. Is this your application as prepared by you and handed in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> The first page is just to give your names, date of birth, address, your career history and other background information.  Do you confirm the correctness of this information, as put in this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I confirm this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> From page 151 in this document you refer specifically to the Motherwell incident. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> You will also find that in this document or in this volume, as from page 115, there appears the document titled Framework.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Is that a document prepared by you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes, I prepared that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> This document gives an explanation of your personal history, your career history, the background to the technical division of the security branch, involvement of the technical division and broadly, also the background for your amnesty application. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Do you confirm the correctness of the information in this as far as it concerns you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I confirm that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> I specifically want to draw your attention to what we are here for, that is the Motherwell incident.  It is common knowledge that during the day of the 13th of December 1989, De Kock and Nieuwoudt visited you.  Where did that take place and can you remember at what time more or less on that specific day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I can remember that it took place in my office in the official offices in Rebecca Street.  The time I am not sure of, it could have between eight and eleven. I think during the consultation I told you that it could have been between ten or 10,30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> You have no independent recollection of the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Can you remember how it happened that these people met you?  Did they make arrangements, did they arrange for a meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I can't remember such arrangements. I can just remember that they came to my office together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> You knew De Kock at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes, I knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> How long have you known him at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I knew him for about six years, I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Was there a relationship of trust between you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I think there was a particular relationship of trust.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Did you know Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, I did not know Nieuwoudt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Can you remember whether he came to your office together with De Kock or did they come separately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That detail I can't remember, but as I recall it, they came more or less at the same time. If they made an arrangement to come there, I can't say specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> After they arrived there, what did they tell you, what was the purpose of this visit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Mr De Kock told me, he started the discussion and said there were certain problems in the Eastern Cape.  This resulted from offences committed by members of the security branch and they were a security risk, and on a higher level a decision was made to eliminate these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Can you remember whether at that stage it was told to you who at the higher level gave the instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Possibly it could have been told to me, but I can't remember pertinently. In my statement I have said that it was Genl Van Rensburg.  It was conveyed to me that this decision was taken at head office, and the authorisation was given at head office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Was there any reason to doubt this what they told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> What was the request to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Shortly, they requested me that I should develop a mechanism to eliminate these people by means of a bomb. This should happen in the vicinity of Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Did they explain to you why it should be a bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> The reason for that was that the responsibility should be put before the door of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> How would they achieve that?  How would they achieve that, to blame the ANC for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> At that stage we did not discuss those details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> At that meeting was it discussed which members of your division would participate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> After De Kock had left, I had not taken this decision. I first had to survey the various circumstances, which staff were available. I gave him the undertaking that it would be done, that we would be involved, and that we would be ready by the next day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Would you receive any support or assistance from De Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes, to the effect, because he made a vehicle and funds available, and also members of his staff, to support us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> And was a vehicle and cash provided to you later on, as promised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> The money which was given to you, was it a kind of remuneration for your services or what was that for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, the money was put in an envelope and it had to be used for the cost incurred during our journey.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> And this was just then to be used for expenses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> When did you have to do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> It was explained to me that this was an urgent matter and it had to be done the next night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> How would you get to Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Mr De Kock would provide transport and we had to travel by car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> After De Kock and Nieuwoudt left your office, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I don't know whether it was immediately afterwards, it was the next hour or so, I called Kobus Kok to my office and I explained the circumstances to him, and I tasked him to put things together and to make provision for anything which might occur in the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> This Kobus Kok you are referring to, this is Jacobus Kok the fifth applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> What was his position in your division?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> He was one of the technicians, one of the most reliable and trusted men in my division and we had a very good working relationship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> And you trusted this man with the project of this  nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Absolutely, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Which preparatory measures did he have to take?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> With a task of this kind, he had to get various instruments together, and also explosives, and we had to develop a receiver which I had in my possession. I asked him to prepare all these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Where did you get all these items from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Regarding the explosives, we had that in our possession.  We made many tests regarding various limpet mines and got one of the techniques we researched regarding this explosive which would be used.  We also used another kind of explosive.  But, I could not say why we had this in our possession, but we discussed this, Kobus Kok and myself, and he explained that that was the kind of explosive we used to dispose of land-mines.  We used this kind of explosive to dispose of the rest of these land-mines. The rest of the instruments were in my office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Where did this come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I had a receiver in my possession, and during a research project there was a lead at the explosive division to dispose of the bombs, by remote control.  I received one of these senders and the receivers and I thought it would be useful to use in an operation of this kind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Whom did you decide would execute this matter in Port Elizabeth?  Who was the person who would be involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> There was nobody else that I could send with Kobus. Therefore, I went with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> When did you leave for Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> We went after office hours and I think Kobus picked me up at nine o'clock that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> That was the vehicle made available to you by De Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Did you drive right through the night to Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> So you arrived in Port Elizabeth early the next morning, the morning of the 14th of December 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> At what time did you arrive here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I think it was round about five o'clock, it was still dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> What happened after your arrival?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> We went to a garage near the beach.  We stopped there for fuel, we washed our faces.  A little  distance from there we called Nieuwoudt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> What arrangement was made with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> We did not know Port Elizabeth at all. We told him where we were.  He came to fetch us from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Did he fetch you from where you were near the beach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Where did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> He took us to a private house in one of the residential areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> What happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> When we arrived there, two of De Kock's men were there.  We did not know which of these men would be involved. We found Snor Vermeulen and Snyman. They were busy preparing breakfast.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Was there anybody else present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> The two of us were there, the two men I have previously mentioned, Nieuwoudt, and also another person I did not know. I still do not know who it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> In your application you said it was an older person, who at a certain stage appeared to be a senior officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> But up to today you do not know who it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Do you have a suspicion who it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> After discussions I had later on, the people told me, Nieuwoudt told me actually, that it was Brig Gilbert.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> From this house, what happened afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> We left there in a convoy, we drove in the same vehicle we arrived there.  We went to a certain point with a lot of trees.  We stayed there for an hour.  During this time Nieuwoudt left us and he went to fetch the Jetta. He came back where he joined us at the point where he had left us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Does that mean he went to a certain point, left you and came back later on with the Jetta? Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Is that the Jetta in which the explosive device was put in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Kemp, I think we must take it from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> As the Court pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let him tell us what he did from the Jetta, let us take it from the time the Jetta was given to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> From that point on you went to a different place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Where did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I do not know that place. It was in the vicinity of Port Elizabeth, on the outskirts, it was in an area with a lot of trees.  We stopped under the trees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Now just for the full information of the Committee I want to ask you, you mentioned the people whom  you saw at the house, but one of the people who was here you did not mention, that is Martiens Ras.  When did he get involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> As far as I can remember, I can remember vaguely, I didn't see him at this house, but he joined us somewhere on this road where he went with us to this area.  We started working there, that is Kobus Kok and myself. We removed the seats and the carpets in order to place the explosive device.  The other people were standing there and assisted us from time to time, handing instruments, et cetera. Then we placed the explosives in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Did any of the people who were there, assist you to assemble this vehicle and place in the explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> They might have assisted us in assembling, but placing the explosives was done by us, the technical people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> After the explosives were placed in the vehicle, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> It was placed in such a way that it could not be - that it was not noticeable.  The various charges were connected.  The receiver we put in the boot and we also attached that.  So it would mean, and ensured that it would be safe during a journey.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Who would activate this system when it became necessary?</p>

<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Before you continue.  Can you just keep your hands from the microphone. I don't know whether it is you or Mr Kemp but something is making a lot of noise on our ear-phones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Who would be responsible for the eventual handling and the detonation of this device?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> We described what to do to Nieuwoudt and he would be the person who would activate the code and initiate the detonation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> After this vehicle was prepared by you, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> After we had finished our work, we got all our things together and we left the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Can you remember more or less what time it was</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>when you finished the preparations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> We left the scene, round about four o'clock that afternoon, we left Port Elizabeth at four o'clock that afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Where did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> We went back to Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> And when did you arrive in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> I can't remember the exact time, but it was late that night, early the next morning. I'm sorry, we arrived there the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> At a later stage did you hear that an explosion had taken place in Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> We heard over the media that an explosion had taken place and four people had been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Did you know who those people were, the people who were the target of this bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, I did not know the people.  Even if they had conveyed the names to me, I would not have recognised them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> After this had happened, were you part of the attempt to cover all this up, to cover the involvement of the security police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes, I was part of this cover-up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> You know today that four people were killed because of this action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> To take those lives, how do you feel about that today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> It is never an easy situation. I am not saying that because of a lot of experience, but it can't be an easy thing for any person to be involved in the killing of other people.  In my case it was very traumatic, it is still traumatic and it will remain like that.  Here, at this forum, I would like to convey to the family my sympathy and to say that I am very sorry that I had an instrumental role to play in killing their relatives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEMP:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, that is the end of the evidence in chief.</p>

<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> While Mr Ford is busy, I want to refer to something at the bottom of page 151.  You are saying Nieuwoudt expanded and told us that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>"The intelligence structures determined that discussions have already taken place between these people and members of the ANC, and this gave it a very actual dimension."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>With this discussion is meant that it involved people who are in the process of defecting to the ANC, and they were regarded as ANC supporters, who were directly against combating the total onslaught.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Is that correct that that was told to you at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Du Toit, it is so that you were convicted in the criminal trial which was held. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> And that conviction is presently on appeal, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> And what is your sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Fifteen years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Now Mr Du Toit, at the time of this incident, you were relatively speaking, a senior officer, would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> To what are you referring? The period or the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> At the time when this incident happened, when you were confronted in your office and agreed to do the necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> In our terms it is regarded as a middle manager.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> There would have been no great terror for you in questioning an order from a senior officer? It would have been legitimate for you to have done so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I think so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Or at least to understand the motivation behind an order with such drastic consequences as was the case in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Somewhere in my application I have explained the way in which we operated regarding this type of operations.  The motives were never questioned by members of the technical division.  We never evaluated or judged those decisions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Yes, we know that you said that in your application, Mr Du Toit. What I am asking you now, is that would there have been any serious consequences in so far as you were concerned, had you at least asked for some explanation as to why you were being required to participate in this drastic operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, I don't think it would have had a drastic implication.  But I did not doubt De Kock's word and I did not doubt his integrity. It would not have a drastic impact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Now you heard the questions which I put to Mr De Kock, concerning the legitimacy of orders and there must surely come a time when you question an order which is given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> It can be like that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Now if your evidence is to be believed, Mr Du Toit</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>"To taking of lives is never an easy decision."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>It is a discussion you made and you don't seem to have had any difficulty in making.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> To give the necessary perspective, I am trying to say with that, that I did not have any say in the decision to take lives. I got involved through preparing the explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> You never thought of questioning that order in any way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Your involvement in these matters was somewhat removed, was it not?  Specifically in this matter, you weren't required to push the button.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Your expertise was only used to plant the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Are you saying that even in those circumstances it was a difficult decision to make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> It was, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Well, then why didn't you even consider questioning, Mr Du Toit? If it was difficult, and you were not going to in any way compromise your position, why didn't you consider questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I can't explain that to you. I will regard that as part of my work.  I did not question De Kock's motivation and/or neither his integrity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> This wasn't an ordinary everyday order, Mr Du Toit, this was an exceptional order, was it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Definitely, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Hadn't you ever been required to participate in the murder or the killing of your colleagues before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Well, then wasn't this a different situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> These people, according to my perception, and I am not trying to justify it here, is all I want to say, is according to my perception, they were on the point of or involved in treason, and that would prejudice the information we got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> You were aware of the drastic measures that were available in so far as the detention of individuals are concerned, at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I did not have intimate knowledge, but I knew about that. I knew the guidelines. I did not have intimate knowledge of the guidelines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> You were just somebody following orders, Mr Du Toit, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Perhaps not as simple as that, but I felt I received instructions and I had to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> And you weren't going to question those orders either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Can I just have a moment, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whose orders were you following?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Chairperson, I accepted that I was following the instructions of the people from head office.  This instruction was not given directly to me.  We played a supporting role.  We supported the activities of the security branch, or no instruction came directly from an executive officer to me. It would come via the person or persons who had a specific need and through that channel it was brought to my attention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The only person, if I understand you correctly, who approached you, was Col De Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The only person who had approached you was Col De Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I don't understand what - what other possible source was there which you regarded as source, the source of orders to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Col De Kock was accompanied by Mr Nieuwoudt from the Eastern Cape.  He quickly explained all the circumstances surrounding this case and there was no reason to question this instruction. I accepted that they got the necessary clearance from head office to execute this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did Col De Kock give you an order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, it was not an instruction, it was just a request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is what is worrying me.  Did Nieuwoudt give you an order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who gave you an order to go and kill those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I accepted that this instruction came from De Kock's commanding officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't hear you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I accepted that this instruction came from De Kock's commanding officer, and it was cleared on a higher level.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you for a moment think that somebody had said to De Kock go and get Wybrandt du Toit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes, in total, that was what I believed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On what basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Well, Col De Kock conveyed it to me like that, that he came from head office, with the request that these people should be handled in this way, and we were requested to play a role in this regard, regarding the elimination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I accept that De Kock would have told you that the operation itself, I am talking about the operation, I am not talking about his instructions to you. I accept that (indistinct) this operation had been cleared by head office, but are you saying that De Kock also said to you the head office said that or somebody has said that you, Wynand du Toit, must also come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> There is something wrong with the microphones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No.  I have mentioned previously that the instruction was that the technical component that they should become involved. I, myself as a person was not mentioned per se. I have tried to explain previously that after they have left my office, I tried to determine who were available. I could have used two other people and in that instance I would have given the instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) between you and Col De Kock, to me seems to be somewhat different, for obvious reasons. The relationship between him, Ras and Vermeulen and (indistinct).  The impression I get is that Col De Kock came and requested you to assist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That is correct, but he also told me that he had a mandate to do that.  That was how this executive instructions worked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps that's why Mr Ford is asking you if Col De Kock merely came and requested you to come and assist.  Could you - why didn't you question that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> In the spirit of the times during which we operated.  Today it might be easy, after all this time, it is easy to say, but in the spirit of those times, I want to say unequivocally that there was a very strong bond of trust between the security people, and for that reason I could not question that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That might have been so, but one gets the impression that the request or the approach by De Kock was such that you could without any consequences, have said to him I'm afraid, I don't want to eliminate some of my colleagues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I think one of the previous applicants previously said I don't think it would have been suitable to refuse such an instruction.  It would have exposed you as somebody who could not be trusted, if you did not want to participate in the counter-measure against the revolutionary struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If by the word "opdrag", you mean instructions or orders then we are just moving in circles.  Maybe I should just leave it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Thank you.  May I continue, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Maybe ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> I'm sorry, I didn't hear you, Mr Chairperson?</p>

<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>	Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Du Toit, just carrying on from the questions asked by the Chairman. It is now clear from what you say that not only or shall we put it this way, that you weren't in fact following orders, following an order, you were complying with a request, no more than that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I would have regarded it as an order in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Was Mr De Kock entitled to give you orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> He conveyed the order from headquarters to me and made it clear to me that this matter had been cleared and headquarters, and that he had been referred to me by headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> And if I understand your evidence further, that the only reason you wouldn't have questioned such an order, was that this might have led to some mistrust, in so far as you were concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, I couldn't say that that was the only reason. I say it was one of the reasons. I had no reason to doubt it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> I must just put it to you, Mr Du Toit, that in regard to this section of your evidence, it does not appear that the decision to assist in the taking of lives, was as difficult a decision for you as you made it out to be in your evidence in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I have said before it is never an easy decision to take.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> When did your trial, the trial in which you were convicted and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, when did that commence, Mr Du Toit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> During the period February to November 1995 to July 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Judgment was handed down on the 14th of June 1996, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Did you testify in that trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes, indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> And you denied your involvement in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> And you then presumably instructed your legal representatives to note an appeal on your behalf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> That appeal is still pending?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> When did you decide to apply for amnesty, Mr Du Toit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Beginning of December 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Why didn't you decide to apply, if you were genuinely regretful, if you genuinely wished to make amends for what you had done, the facility was available to apply for amnesty before then, why did you wait so long before you applied for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> At the time of our arrest, this process or procedure had not yet been thought through properly and we hadn't yet built up any trust, confidence in the process, and that's why we decided not to deal with it on that basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Would it be unfair to say, Mr Du Toit, that your decision to apply for amnesty only came some time after it was clear that you had been convicted and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, and if one has regard to the judgment, I would suggest to you it is unlikely that you will be acquitted on appeal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I don't know what ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> I'm sorry, you don't understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> I will repeat it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Please do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Yes.  You applied for amnesty only after it was clear to you that you had been convicted and sentenced. Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> In that trial you lied, you said that you had not been involved. That's correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> You noted an appeal, you have agreed to that, and what I am suggesting to you, and you are not a "regsgeleerde" as they say, so you don't have to comment if you don't wish to, that if one has regard to the judgment, there is not much chance of you succeeding on appeal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> On the basis upon which we should have or would have conducted the appeal, we had no other reason at that stage or other options. We had to put the process in motion to get to this point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Isn't this just a last-ditch attempt to avoid being in prison for 15 years, Mr Du Toit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> That might be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR FORD</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is a choice the law gives him, Mr Ford.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORD:</span> That is so.  That is so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No, thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR BRINK</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Mr Du Toit, the section in which you worked, was that a part of the security police, the security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> It was the technical section within the security police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes, it was a section of the security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> It was a section of the security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Did you ever have any doubts as to whether the mission or authorisation had been given from up high for this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I never had any such doubts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Who was your immediate superior at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> The chiefs varied at the time. I think it could have been Brig Hellberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Did you inform him of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Or this request to carry out an order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I can't remember the detail exactly.  The 14th of December is a time when a lot of people are on leave and even if he had been there, I wouldn't necessarily have gone to him with this request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> It was a covert operation which was carried out on a one-to-one basis and on a need-to-know basis, and only people who were actively involved would have known about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> But you had to use one of the members of this section in the carrying out of this operation and in regard to certain devices and things which belonged to this unit, you had to use these in the carrying out of the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Didn't you require permission for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I was a sub-commander of the unit and I did have some leeway to act, and to use equipment of that kind.  I didn't need specific permission to use that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> So you could just take whatever you liked and use members and launch an operation somewhere else, in another division?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, I don't think it was that simple. All I am trying to say is that to put the matter in perspective, the technical section wasn't office-bound.  We functioned on a national basis, and we had a multiplicity of tasks. In other words, there was a great interaction of people, and movement of people in and out of the office, and it wouldn't have been strange if people weren't in the office.  There was a constant interchange of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Did you tell your chief, your superior, that you would be absent from the office and that you were taking Mr Kok with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I saw fit to limit the information and not to share it with just everybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Did you sneak out of the office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, I wouldn't describe it as sneaking out. We left there during normal office hours. We just weren't in the office the next day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> But the people who worked with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> That you weren't going to be there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Why not? How did it come about that they didn't know that you were going to be absent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Well, the next day I simply wasn't present at the office and I think it would have been unwise to publicise an operation of such great sensitivity, so we limited the information to the members directly involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Did you try to be absent from the office in an inconspicuous way and then sneak back quietly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I wouldn't describe it as going back on the quiet. We travelled a lot and it wouldn't have raised many eyebrows if we weren't in the office on a particular day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Yes, but you wanted to take part in this operation in a totally inconspicuous way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Well, an operation of this nature is something which one can't carry out in secret, if a lot of people know about it, I tried to limit the number of people that knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Yes, but what about your superior?  Why was it necessary to be absent from the office in an inconspicuous way, so that even your superior wouldn't know about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> We travelled round a lot, we were often absence from the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> I understand that, but I am trying to get you to answer the question, as far as your chief is concerned. Why was it necessary for you to slip away from the office unnoticed to take part in this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> As I have already said, I can't remember whether he was there or whether he had already gone on leave. I can't recall the specific circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> That may be, but you are saying that you wanted to be absent from the office without anybody noticing, and that applied even to your chief, that he shouldn't be aware of that. Is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> So I am trying to understand what the reason for that would have been.  If you were convinced there had indeed been authorisation for the operation, why was he not supposed to know.  That's the point I am trying  to clarify. Or did you perhaps have some doubt as to whether the operation had indeed been authorised?  Perhaps you knew that this was such a radical operation, that it was actually a special favour which you were doing for your comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, I wouldn't have seen it in that light.  It was certainly not a favour, it was a high profile operation, and the participants in this operation had to be limited to a small a number as possible, for secrecy purposes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Did you not trust the chief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, I trusted him implicitly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> But then, I still don't understand your answer. I will try again. Why didn't you tell him what you were going to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> He wasn't to take part in the operation and I was going to take part and had I conveyed the information to him and had something gone wrong with the operation, then there would just be extra evidence against us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> So in the normal course of events, if you were to take part in operations, you would have notified him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> As far as normal technical tasks are concerned, yes, but in the case of extraordinary operation such as this, information was always limited to the minimum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Was this the first occasion on which you acted in such a way, namely to keep your chief in ignorance of what you were doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I don't know whether that was the first time, it was probably not the only time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Was it necessary for Mr De Kock, with whom you said you had a special bond of trust, was it necessary to convince him to help you, to assist you in this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Do you mean by persuade, do you mean by means of an explanation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Yes, were you sceptical or critical or was it necessary for him to argue with you, and to justify the operation, et cetera?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Well, he explained the matter as in much detail as he could, and I accepted that the matter had been dealt with on the divisional ground level and even higher up at head office.  And justification for the operation was not considered by me at all. I accepted that a decision had already been taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> You said that you actually saw this as an order in those circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> So it wasn't actually necessary to try to convince you of the desirability or the justification for the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Well, it was explained to me, but it was not necessary for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> So they actually did it purely as a courtesy from a colleague, but it wasn't actually necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> No, they did explain the desirability or the necessity for this operation. I didn't decide of my own accord to take such drastic action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Mr De Kock testified that during a discussion where Nieuwoudt was present, there was at no stage any reference to the ANC and alleged contact between the ANC and the people who were to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes, that's what I heard and that is what I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Is that your recollection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> But it wasn't necessary for them to give you any details regarding the justification of the operation and so forth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Well, they did sketch it to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> So it wasn't an important aspect for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes, it was.  What was told to me basically, was that these people would go over to the ANC and that that would jeopardise the whole intelligence network and people's lives would be endangered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Or Mr De Kock could have told you look, Mr Du Toit, we have to take part in an operation, head office has sanctioned it and it is important, it is an urgent matter and you have to help us with an explosive device.  Would that have been sufficient for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> I assume that that would have been good enough for me, if I had to hand it to him for own use, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> So the reasons and the detail, et cetera, that wasn't of such critical importance to you.  You had a very special bond of trust with De Kock and you could simply take his word for it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Did Mr De Kock testify against you at the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Did he contradict your version that you didn't know anything about this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Was that during the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> So he contradicted your version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU TOIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you want to re-examine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>RE-EXAMINATION BY MR KEMP</p>
