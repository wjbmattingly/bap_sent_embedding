This is not a joking matter, it is a serious matter and not one which you just brush over for the benefit of any person.\n\tThe intention is to see to it with that at long last justice is done in this matter and if I must be involved in doing justice in this matter, I must be properly instructed.  I have never done so before and I won't do so now, I will never proceed in a matter where I am not ready for the benefit of the people I'm acting for, to move ahead.  Therefore, when I make this application it is meant not for my benefit but for the benefit of the families sitting down there, therefore I request that I be given time to do justice for the last time to those who are not here, the two people who passed away and their families.\n\tI have access to certain information which was not available to me until this morning, with regards to certain possible witnesses.  I would need to interview, prior to doing any cross-examination.  This therefore means there could be two possibilities, one would be to postpone until I have seen these witnesses, which we hope to do tonight when they will first be available or alternatively, if it is so felt the proceedings can go on for as long as I am not called upon to cross-examine anybody - which is our intention to cross-examine  so, there are two options available.",

Mr Chairman, there's a few matters - house-holding matters, before I ask him to give his evidence.\n\tFirstly, his application you will find or an extract thereof, at page 24.  If I may say so Mr Chairman, what was very sensibly done is that it has been shortened, extracts have been made from the original application of Mr Erasmus to conform with the matter in hand namely, Messrs Madaka and Mthimkhulu.  \tUnfortunately, if you turn to page 28, paragraph 10(a), you will see that there is a reference to paragraph 10(a) at page 5 of the application, now that has unfortunately been omitted from the papers before you and of course that is very relevant.  We have made copies for your benefit Mr Chairman, which we beg leave to hand up to you and what we've done is we have marked - it's four pages only, and what we have done is we have marked them 28(a) to (d).  They are already numbered - the pages.  \n\tIf you would perhaps be so kind Mr Chairman, as to just include that in your bundle which is the bundle with the legend amnesty applications of - and the four applicants are mentioned.
