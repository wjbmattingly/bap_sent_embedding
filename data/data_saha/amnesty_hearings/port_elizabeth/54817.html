<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a> CHAIRPERSON:	It is the 30th of September 1997.  We are </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>proceeding with the applications that we have been hearing since </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>yesterday and the panel of the Committee is constituted as </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	We have just finished hearing Mr Lotz and there is a request </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>as to whether he can be excused from further attendance, and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>believe that can be done, unless somebody has problems with it, </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>subject of course to the condition that he would be available should </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>he be needed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   He is available, Mr Chairman, he is a cellphone </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>call away.  He would obviously not be available within five minutes </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>or so, but we can get hold of him, he his not leaving town or </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>anything like that.  In that regard, may I perhaps also ask, we have </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>handed to you in chambers an affidavit by Mr Lotz, in which he just </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>expands on his application, where we ask for an amendment to his </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>application, to cover certain other offences, not necessarily other </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>offences, but offences which might flow from the same incident.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>Does the Commission require me to read it into the record or is it </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>adequate that my Attorney handed it over to you in chambers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Because it is a loose paper, it maybe just get </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>displaced, maybe you should just read it into the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Certainly Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>affidavit reads:</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>		I the undersigned, Gerhardus Johannes Lotz declare </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>under oath as follows:  On the 29th of September 1997 </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>I have already proposed by amnesty application, </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>additionally should be added to paragraph 9(a)(1) </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>offences and as well as any other offence or omission </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>and more specifically, perjury and an attempt at </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>defeating the ends of justice as appears clearly from my </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>evidence before this Commission".</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>And it is signed by the deponent and confirmed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the amendment is granted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   As the Committee pleases Mr Chairman.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Chairman, may I take this opportunity, I am sorry </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>to interrupt, merely to place on record Mr Chairman, that we have </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>been confronted, I am talking about my Attorney and myself, with </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>some difficulties.  For reasons which aren't clear, we were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>furnished with a full copy of the amnesty applications, we were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>aware of that obviously until certain documentation was referred to </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>	Yesterday for the first time we came into the possession of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>applications of the applicants Ras, Kok and Du Toit and certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>portions of the application of the present applicant today, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>Nieuwoudt, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>	We have studied what is now available to us, we believe that </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>it may well require an application to recall at least Mr Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>Rensburg, to deal with certain issues which are dealt with more </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>clearly in these applications.  I just wanted to place that on record.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>There is an outside possibility that that may also involve Lotz, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>do not anticipate that to be so, Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, why would you say that Van Rensburg </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>might be recalled?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>ADV FORD:   Because of certain further information which has </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>become apparent from the documentation which we now have </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>relating both to the fraud aspect and to the Goniwe aspect, if I can </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>refer to it in those terms Mr Chairman, and certain other information </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>which has also become available.  But I do not wish to deal with it </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>at this stage Mr Chairman, I merely wish to place it on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you will motivate that application as and </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>when ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>ADV FORD:   Certainly, when I bring it, Mr Chairman, I will </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>motivate it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Mr Ford, kindly for our own household </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>purposes, when did you receive the applications and when did you </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>receive the further documents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Chairman, through you Mr Chairman, we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>formally instructed some ten days ago when we got the batch of </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>documentation which we believed to be full, the full documentation </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>relating to the applications.  During the first part of the hearing </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>yesterday, it became apparent that certain of the applications had </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>not been made available to us.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>	I got from Mr Brink his copies, his bound copies, we don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>have such bound copies, indexed copies of the applications, I got it </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>from him and over lunch time yesterday we were able to make copies </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>of all those documents which we had not been furnished with, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>obviously we didn't have time to peruse them.  Last night and this </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>morning we have spent time perusing them and trying to investigate </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>and consider certain of the other issues which are raised there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Thank you.  Mr Brink, I take it you would kindly </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>take it up with the office in Cape Town, why wasn't the victims' </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>representatives furnished with full copies of the documents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>MR BRINK:   I have made a note of that already Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I sincerely hope this is not going to cause some </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>delays in our proceedings, because in our view, there is no reason </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>why we shouldn't dispose of this matter by Thursday evening, </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>Thursday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>	I sincerely hope that every attempt would be made to try and </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>help Mr Ford where necessary and Mr Ford, you will make use of </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>such time as would be available to you to clear up such issues so as </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>to avoid delay in the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>ADV FORD:   I certainly will Mr Chairman, and it is certainly not </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>our intention to delay the proceedings, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>ADV BOOYENS:	Thank you Mr Chairman.  I call Gideon Johannes </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>Nieuwoudt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>GIDEON JOHANNES NIEUWOUDT:	(sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>EXAMINATION BY ADV BOOYENS:	Mr Nieuwoudt you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>applying for amnesty in the matter  and you have your amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>application in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   I refer to the first page thereof to the point </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>where you start with your personal summary on the second page of </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>that, do you confirm the correctness of that?  Mr chairman, this is at </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>page 296, it starts off at page 296 of the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Do you further confirm the contents of </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 of the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The personal summary illustrates where your </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>political convictions were shaped and indicates that you later </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>became a supporter of the National Party government and the basis </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   On page 300, that is page 5 of the application, </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>you deal with the general background and your experience in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>Security Branch, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Do you confirm what appears in paragraphs 1, 2, </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>3 and 4.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In paragraph 5 you refer to certain annexures.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>Perhaps we could just tell the Committee that annexure 3 appears on </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>page 377, annexure 4 on page 385, annexure 9 appears on page 421 </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>and 422 and annexure 12 appears on page 435, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you enclose these annexures as </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>corroboration of the fact that the broad masses in the 1970's and </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>1980's had become very politicised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You also in terms of paragraph 6, these </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>annexures 5 and 6?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   On page 304, that is page 9 of your application, </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>you refer to the four pillars of the revolutionary war and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>opposition against the National Party government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And then you further elaborate in this paragraph </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>on this aspect and how it ultimately developed that there was this </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>so-called - that the politicisation led to a mobilisation for so-called </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>people's war, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You then continue on page 304, paragraph 7, to </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>sketch the history further as well as in paragraph 8?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Paragraph 9?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And up to paragraph 12?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   What you mentioned here, did you obtain that </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>from literature and your own experience on the ground as a Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>Policeman, in other words was it only theory or was it also </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>happening in practice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was happening in practice and I also got this </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>from literature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   On page 12 you deal with the extension of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>structures and the New Year's message of 1986, and the combat </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>units of MK who launched attacks on strategic targets, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In paragraph 13, I think the word police officers </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>should be added because in that list, the people that were killed </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>were also warders and people like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you obtain these details from murder and </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>robbery documentation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, from their registers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Perhaps we can just tell the Committee, I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>forgotten for a moment that the Committee members are not from </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>Port Elizabeth so we can just go through KwaZakhele, that is Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>Elizabeth district?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Page 309, Swartkops, that is also a police </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>station here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The same goes for New Brighton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Adelaide is not in Port Elizabeth, is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It is in the Eastern Cape, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And then we have Swartkops again.  And then </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>13.1.13 there is a Grahamstown incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is Eastern Cape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Cradock is also in the Eastern Cape, although </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>the case was in the Somerset East, that is the Eastern Cape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Once again KwaZakhele.  Paragraph 14, there </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>you deal with the damage to police vehicles and an amount is </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>mentioned there, that is obviously in terms of the money in those </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you have any personal knowledge of attacks </p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>on police officers and that the homes were burnt down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In paragraph 15 you deal with the political </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>intimidation and the economical intimidation which deals with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>intimidation of black councillors, consumer boycotts and the rent </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>boycotts, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The boycott against the councillors caused a </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>large number of them to resign as you've set out there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And you mention the specific case of Mr Linda </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>whose business was burnt down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In paragraph 17 you deal with the consumer </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>boycott and in paragraph 18, you deal with the unemployment </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   If we can just get the statistics here, these you </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>obtained from Manpower?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And those were only the unemployment cases </p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>that were actually registered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In paragraph 19 you talk about the Amabutu, </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>what is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is a terminology which was used, to mean </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>the army of the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And annexure 14 to which you refer, is on page </p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>389 is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   On page 316, that is page 21 of the record, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>state that you are applying for amnesty for the murder and other </p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>offences relating to those four people there mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Particulars which may be of importance here are </p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>the following.  For how long had you known Mgoduka, Faku, </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>Mapipa and Jack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Warrant Officer Glen Mgoduka had worked for </p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>the Security Branch since 1977 and he worked with me.  We shared </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>an office along with Mr Marx.  Mr Faku joined the Security Branch </p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>in 1980, and he was also part of my Unit, that is the black affairs </p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>	Mapipa joined later, in 1986 when a special investigation team </p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>was established as result of the state of emergency which had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>declared, that is the state of emergency of 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>	Charles Jack was a trained person whom we used as an </p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>informer and he later gave evidence in several court cases and at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>later stage during 1983/1984 he then joined us permanently at our </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   I think the term is commonly known here, he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>an askari?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In other words a person who was trained as an </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>MK and then was turned to work for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And then at page 316 you deal with issues with </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>which we will have to deal with more thoroughly, from page 316, </p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>you deal with the circumstances which reigned and which gave rise </p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>to the death of the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   I think it would be a good thing if you </p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>commented on the fact that you were the Regional Commander of </p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>the Intelligence Unit.  Perhaps you can explain the structure of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>Security Police from 1983 onwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Mr Chairman, in 1983 the Security Branch </p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>component consisted of the Commanding Officer.  After General </p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>Erasmus left Port Elizabeth in 1983 and he went to Johannesburg a </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>Colonel Snyman took over as Commanding Officer and there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>Unit that deal with black affairs of which Colonel Du Plessis was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>	There were also the Indian, coloured and technical and trade </p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>union components.  After 1983 after I had become an officer, I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>in charge of all information or intelligence and the coordination of </p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>that intelligence, viz a vie all the organisations.  The four deceased </p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>Mgoduka, Faku, Mapipa and Charles Jack were under my command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You said four, you mean three?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, three at that stage.  In 1986 I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>transferred to the Special Investigation team who deal with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>investigation into emergency regulations issues.  In June Mapipa, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>third deceased joined us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>	At that stage Sergeant Faku and Mapipa were part of that </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>investigation team.  During June of 1989 I was the Regional </p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>Coordinator of the Eastern Cape region and it also included East </p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>London at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>	And we coordinated the intelligence component which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>actually an extension of the Intelligence component of the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>Branch and it was under the command of Brigadier Gilbert.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   What was the function of the Intelligence Unit, </p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>what was your job?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Intelligence gathering, the maintaining of </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>updated intelligence, the perceptions that existed and the data bases </p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>we had relating to this information, which we obtained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You say that your tasks were set out in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>Police Act, very broadly speaking, I don't think it is necessary to go </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>into that.  Paragraph 3, 3.1 creation, extension and maintenance of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>covert intelligence capacity in respect of internal as well as foreign </p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>intelligence networks, please explain to us in layman's terms what </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>are you talking about here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   We didn't have offices at the Security Branch </p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>per se we had our own facilities, such as safe premises, operating </p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>centres.  Part of our duty was to gather intelligence relating to </p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>covert actions and we operated under cover in that respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In the process, you made use of agents and those </p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>kinds of persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Paragraph 4, page 318, you say that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>importance of an effective intelligence network, you refer to that </p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>and then you define what you mean by an effective intelligence </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>network, perhaps you should explain to us, you talk about </p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>associates, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Mr Chairman, associates would act as go- </p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>betweens between the agent and the handler.  And in my case, as is </p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>well known in Port Elizabeth, I made specific use of associates to </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>deal with the agents for me in order to protect their identities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   So an associate would be a civilian person who </p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>is well disposed towards you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   As far as the source is concerned, would the </p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>source necessarily always have known that he was working for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>Security Police or would he sometimes be under the impression that </p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>he was working for MI6 or the CIA or something like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   The agent wouldn't know that he was working </p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>for the Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Were the sources sometimes deliberately brought </p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>under the impression that they were working for some of the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>intelligence agencies that I have referred to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You are talking about agents there as well, those </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>are underground policemen, policemen who act as underground </p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>spies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you also make use of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You also relate physical sources, those are </p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Non-physical sources, would that be technology </p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>for instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Interception, monitoring, interception of post, </p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>etc.  That type of situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The existence of an intelligence network, did </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>that depend on the existence of these people, in other words could </p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>you gather intelligence if you did not have these kind of people to </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>work for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, we would not be able to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You refer to the fact that it often takes quite a </p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>long time to recruit reliable sources and agents and associates, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Yes, most people wouldn't make an immediate </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>decision to work for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Then you say that in 1988 a need was identified </p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>and in 1989 the intelligence operation was established.  You say that </p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>on page 318, paragraph 5?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You mention that there was a real fear amongst </p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>associates, agents, sources and informers that they were not assured </p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>of sufficient protection as far as their identity and security was </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>concerned?  So there was a problem in that regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Your local Security Policemen, such as yourself, </p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>could not do the work of the agents and informers, because you </p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>were well-known?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Paragraph 7, the exposure of members and </p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>informers, they were intimidated and murdered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   It was also the declared policy of the liberation </p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>alliance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   As far as the identity of informers were </p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>concerned, do you think that there would still be some antagonism </p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>to some of these people if they were still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You were present here last week during an </p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>application when there was reference to a certain informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   I saw it on a poster which was displayed here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   There was a lady in front of the building here, </p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>saying that the identity of the informer should be revealed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In paragraph 8 you deal with the fact that </p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>violence had escalated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   We now are moving towards the 1988/1989 era?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In paragraph 9, you deal with the so-called </p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>operating facility.  You already mentioned the fact that that is where </p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>you had your administrative centre and that that was not at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>police station as such.  You made use of other premises for your </p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>intelligence business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And safe houses and premises, those would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>places normally used to debrief agents, informers and such?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You mention in paragraph 10, something which </p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>is probably very well known, that intelligence services throughout </p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>the world, make use of cover operations such as these?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In paragraph 11, page 321, in July 1989, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>came to the conclusion that there was a leak, an intelligence leak </p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>from the Security Branch, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Even before this happened, you had some </p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>suspicion that there could be problems?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And it related with an operation in Swaziland.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>Please try and keep it as brief as possible, but please tell us what the </p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>situation was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   At that stage we had a trained cadre in </p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>detention and we were busy interrogating him and he was supposed </p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>to make contact with the other members of his cell to infiltrate and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>made use of that opportunities, the four deceased were also present </p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>during that interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>	The trained person then wrote a letter for me in which he </p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>made contact with the contact person in Swaziland and I used a </p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>source as a courier to hand over this letter and the objective was </p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>that the ANC would give him the weapons with the view to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>establishment of a DLB internally and to be able to exercise control </p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>over that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You sent the source in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, the source was sent in.  Later I learnt that </p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>he had been detained in Quatro.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Now Quatro is an ANC camp in Angola?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Were they detained and interrogated spies and </p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>people like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   This source came known to the other side on one </p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>or other way and you said it was you yourself and the four deceased </p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>who were involved.  Did anybody else from your side know about </p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Nobody else knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   This was the first instance, this was before 1989, </p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Can you remember when this was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   This was the first indication, not even the first, </p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>but did you start realising then around July 1989 that there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>problems with the intelligence network at the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Can you mention other examples?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I can.  I know of two instances where Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>Mgoduka was present where he acted as my associate and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>recruited a person under false pretences.   And later he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>necklaced.  In another instance, it happened in the same way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>	It happened in Lesotho.  He was murdered there and I had the </p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>suspicion that the information was conveyed to the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You mention this agent's name.  Was that </p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>because he was shot dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The name is Mtoto Mbali.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In both cases Mgoduka was with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Were there any of your colleagues that </p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>complained that the effectiveness of the intelligence was not good </p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>any more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did that mean that sources were inactive, agents </p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>did not report any more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You have already mentioned that Mr Mgoduka </p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>worked with you.  Did the others work with you from time to time </p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In the situation on the ground, it could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>been that the black members working with you and would they have </p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>known who were your sources?   Would the black members know </p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>how the sources worked, which methods you were using?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   If a source had to be arranged, a meeting at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>safe house, you were well-known?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You were well-known in Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Could you for example go and fetch this source </p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>of did you use the black members for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I used the black members to go and fetch these </p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>sources.  Amongst others Mgoduka and Faku and Mapipa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And were they with you when these sources were </p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>debriefed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did they hear at certain instances which </p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>instructions were given to the sources and the agents, for example if </p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>a specific person or organisation was targeted, would they have </p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>known?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You also used other sources, people who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a>murdered, but according to you do they still have family in Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>Elizabeth and therefore you would not like to disclose who they </p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>were because according to you it would, the families' lives endanger </p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>or they would be ostracised by the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, for sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You mentioned earlier, and we are on page 23 of </p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>the false flag method.  What does that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   This is a method whereby the person who was </p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>recruited, that he as I have already mentioned that I am using an </p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a>associate to execute this covert operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   This was the person who for example said he </p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>worked for the CIA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   So you became more and more suspicious that </p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>this leak in the intelligence network could have come from </p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a>Mgoduka's side?  The initial suspicion was on him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   But at that initial stage, you only had a suspicion </p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>and nothing more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   As it became clear, also based on what your </p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>colleagues had said, was counter espionage also part of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>intelligence network?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, it was.  At that stage I handled the </p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a>counter espionage component.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Counter espionage means to find spies working </p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>for the other side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   On page 324, on paragraph 14, round about </p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>August 1989, this idea of the leakage and your suspicions were </p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>discussed with Brigadier Gilbert.  He told you that you had to </p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a>investigate this matter to determine whether this leakage was coming </p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>from the inside.  Whether there was a mole situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   At that stage, because it had become clear that </p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>certain parts of your covert operations had been disclosed, and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>you had to spend money to find other premises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Paragraph 16 I want you to discuss this in detail. </p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a> You said security measures were tightened, information was </p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a>handled on a need to know basis, that was all to prevent that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>moles could obtain more information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You tried to determine whether there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a>surveillance instruments in your safety premises and also </p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>surveillance was instituted in your own premises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And you mentioned the WH11 method, that was </p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>monitoring telephone calls?  That worked with a sound recorder </p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a>which was activated by voice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You also said that other monitoring apparatus </p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>was also installed at Louis le Grange square and also in the tea room </p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>of that building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You had a suspicion at that stage regarding Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a>Mgoduka, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Then you refer to the post which was intercepted </p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a>according to the WH10 method.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Our technical division fetched the post early in </p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>the morning, they had a person in the post office who sorted the </p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a>post, and they had a list of well-known addresses which we have </p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>provided them with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>	Addresses overseas and internally.  There were certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a>addresses in Lesotho.  Amongst others the Roma Church in Lesotho, </p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>in London a Mr John Smith and in Anreith in Canada and in Eastern </p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a>Germany.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did that work as follows, that all post which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>posted here to all the post posted in the Port Elizabeth environment </p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>and I also think in other big cities, would be taken to the central </p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a>post office to sort them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You had an agent working there and all the post </p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>to a specific address as you have referred to, be intercepted and be </p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>put in a post bag for the Security Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And this post you opened, you steamed it open </p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>and read it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   On the other hand, would the same method be </p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>used with incoming post?  That all post in this specific case, </p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>addressed to Mgoduka, that his post would be intercepted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And it was then brought under your attention </p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>that Mr Mgoduka was receiving post from overseas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct. </p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The letters were innocent, it seemed.  ... (tape </p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>ends)  In this process you mention the Roma Church and an address </p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>in Canada and in Eastern Germany.  These addresses, what was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>meaning of these?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Those were contact addresses for the ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>overseas, from where they would obtain their post.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In other words, post would go from here to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>Roma Church?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And all post going to the Roma Church, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>suspicious?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You say Mgoduka worked with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Some of the post which was intercepted on its </p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>way to these addresses, and you came to the conclusion that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>could have been involved in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   How did you draw this inference?  He did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>sign his own name or used his own address, he did not do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   He did not do that.  From the samples of his </p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a>handwriting and some typed letters from specific typewriters, some </p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>were handwritten and the handwritten letters, I could recognise his </p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>handwriting because he used to write my reports.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You were already suspicious regarding the typed </p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>letters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   He made use of his own typewriter which he </p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>had in his office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Was that a mechanical type typewriter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   So he usually typed on the typewriter and from </p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>the intercepted letters, you came to the conclusion that it was done </p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>on that same typewriter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   On the basis of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Mr Chairman, I don't have knowledge and I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>not an expert, but on the typewriter I could see that there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>similarity between certain letters, certain typed letters and so I </p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>could draw the inference that it was coming from the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a>typewriter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   If we can just discuss the contents of these </p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>letters quickly.  These letters was written in a kind of a code </p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>language?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Definitely yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   A person, an uninformed person could draw no </p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a>inference from this letters, it read like a friendly letter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did the Security Branch know that certain words </p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>used in certain letters had a certain meaning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Could you mention a few examples?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Amongst others there is a funeral, it would </p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>appear in the letter.  You must attend a wedding on such and such a </p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Let us use the wedding example.  What did that </p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a>mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That means that people would be sent into, </p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>people would be sent to Lesotho on a specific date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   And if they actually wanted to attend a wedding </p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>or a funeral, what would they say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Then they would come back and say, we would </p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a>attend that on such and such a day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   The person who sends the letter ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Mr Chairman, perhaps you have understood me </p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a>wrong.  If he said he is going to send somebody with a message, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>says there would be a wedding on such and such a day.  It had </p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>nothing to do with a wedding.  The date was important.  So that </p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>means the people had to be sent on that specific date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I understand you, you didn't understand me, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a>we will come back to that later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   I think what the Judge wants to ask, if there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>really a wedding and they were really invited to a wedding, say for </p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>instance come to my daughter's wedding, and he accepts the </p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>invitation and says he is willing to come, how would you distinguish </p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a>between an innocent invitation and an invitation which was encoded, </p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>could you comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I can't comment on that, there is the possibility </p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a>that that could happen.  But I would have determined whether there </p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>was a real wedding.  It could have happened that there was a real </p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>wedding.  But it could have been an innocent letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   But what was important regarding the innocent </p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>letter was not only the letter, but the address to which it was sent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   There were too many weddings and funerals </p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>mentioned in letters to the Roma Church for example?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And this was well-known ANC addresses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Were these addresses where you would expect </p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>that a member of the Security Branch would correspond with </p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a>people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   A member of the Security Branch rather?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   These were kind of cover up addresses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   These were cover up addresses, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And these addresses, those were the addresses </p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a>where the weddings and funerals were mentioned in the letters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Were you satisfied that some of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>correspondence which Mgoduka received, also entailed coded </p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>messages?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You  say Mgoduka, Faku, Mapipa and Sehati </p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>were not members of the intelligence unit, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In other words they were outside this counter </p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>espionage operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   But three of them, they have already been </p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>associated at the least three years, with the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   If the three of them, or the four of them, pooled </p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>their intelligence regarding the Security Branch, the informers, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a>possible informers, the safe premises, it would have been an </p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>enormous source of information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You refer to a safe premises at Tesco which he </p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>knew about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You mention in paragraph 17 that the monitoring </p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>apparatus which you installed, that was in the tea room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Also bore fruit in the end?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And in paragraph 18 you summarised what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>found there.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Were the only those four people present in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>tea room at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Mgoduka and Sehati told you, and they told the </p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>other two that they made contact with a family member of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>Mgoduka who was involved in the liberation struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Please be careful, the paper makes a lot of noise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   I am sorry Mr Commissioner.  The Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>Police had a kind of photo system or a system of photographs which </p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a>you used for identification?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You had a photo album of exiles and based on </p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a>this, you determined that there was a family member of Mgoduka </p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a>who was in exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   If we could possibly just explain.  The photo </p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>album consists of a separate index, it is especially used for </p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a>photograph identification?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   I don't seem to recall we have had documentary </p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>exhibits this far Mr Chairman, I think this will be the first one.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>shall mark it as Exhibit A1 and A2.  And you determined that </p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a>photograph number 2044, was the photograph of Mr Christopher </p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a>Mgoduka and A1 and A2 are photocopies of the photo album of </p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a>exiles and also its index?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   If I could hand this in Mr Chairman.  We have </p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a>made copies for all the legal counsel.  We have copies for the family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a>	Mgoduka and Sehati said that they had already tried to make </p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a>contact and the other two said that they were interested to ... </p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you discuss this interpretation with </p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>Brigadier Gilbert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   At that stage, two of the members also according </p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a>to what you have said, had made contact with the ANC and there </p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>were two on their way to make contact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Gilbert's first reaction was to transfer these </p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Would that have been successful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, it would not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   They could escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Let's start from the beginning.  Should all four </p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>of them had been transferred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Then they would have immediately realised that </p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a>we know about their activities.  The chances were that they would </p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>try to escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   At that stage they were still functioning as </p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a>moles, if these people had to flee and would be debriefed by trained </p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a>intelligence operators, were you satisfied that they had tremendous </p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a>lot of intelligence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I am satisfied with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You yourself at a certain stage, debriefed </p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a>various agents who came back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Just is not a discussion which took 5 or 10 </p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a>minutes over a cup of tea, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Such a debriefing as you have told me, could </p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a>take a few days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And for these four people, the information which </p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a>they had in their possession, according to you what did that include?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   They could, not all, but they could identify </p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a>most of our informers and sketch their profiles.  The profiles on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a>members of the Security Branch could have been exposed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   If you mention a profile that means where he is, </p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a>where he works, where he lives, where his children go to school, </p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a>what car he drives, it is all that type of information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Informers, you also include some agents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Agents, some associates and also sources.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And also regarding the physical sources, or </p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a>rather the physical facilities, the safe premises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.  And also our operating </p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a>centres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In other words with an experienced team of </p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a>interrogators and a tremendous amount of information can be </p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>gathered from these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you have any reason to believe that the ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a>outside and the military wing did not have this capability or did you </p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>know they had this capability?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I was satisfied that they have the ability to do </p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a>this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You mention in paragraph 22 about your </p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a>continued discussion with Brigadier Gilbert, that you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a>mentioned that these members knew about your operations and </p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a>should it be disclosed that these people were double agents or </p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a>moles, it would have had a negative influence on the black members </p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a>in the Security Branch.  They would realise immediately that their </p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a>identity and profiles would be made available to the enemy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a>	Mr Nieuwoudt, an Intelligence network, such as the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a>Police had, there is a problem people are murdered, everybody knew </p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a>about that because they were part of the Security Police and then it </p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a>would have been difficult to recruit other sources?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You struggle to find policeman who would work </p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a>as agents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Should such a mole been able to provide the </p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a>information and the opposition forces use this information, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a>means this whole intelligence network could deteriorate, fall apart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>	Could the Security Police function without an intelligence </p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>network?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, we can't.  It was our ears and our eyes.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a>was theoretically possible to deploy a network, but that would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>taken a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   could you in 1989, as far as you knew at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a>stage, could you afford something like this?  something negative like </p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a>this to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, we couldn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You also mention in paragraph 23 an aspect </p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a>which you have already mentioned, namely that the profiles of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>Security Police could put their lives in danger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You then gave  Gilbert this information and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a>told you to do further investigations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   He also told you that you should perhaps try to </p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a>talk to them and find out if you could extract any information from </p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a>them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   That is paragraph 24.  What happened about </p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I tried, but nothing came of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did they act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   This discussion that we are talking about, what it </p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a>meant was that you confronted him directly and told them that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a>were spies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, no, it was far more subtle than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Paragraph 25, you refer to the fact that you got </p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a>information via an informer in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And that the information was to the effect that </p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a>your safe facilities had already been exposed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And that a specific operation regarding a </p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>Swaziland operation had been exposed and you came to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a>conclusion that that was the agent, the agent had been intercepted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Your information also indicated that this specific </p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>Swaziland source had been detained in Quatro and that Chris Hani </p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>had interrogated him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You then activated your sources further and </p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a>monitored their activities in an ongoing basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Eventually you obtained the information which is </p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a>spelt out in paragraph 26?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Namely that Mgoduka and Charles Jack had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a>recruited by Godji Skenyana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   He operated in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And it then later became clear that both Faku </p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a>and Sehati and later Mapipa as well, had been sub-sources for Godji. </p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a> That Mgoduka was the principal agent and the others had given him </p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a>information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   What was the degree of reliability of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>Lesotho source?  You had certain methods to test sources?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   It was usually compared to information from </p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a>other sources to see how reliable it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In other words, if the agent says there was to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>a bomb at a certain place, and if the bomb exploded, that would act </p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>as corroboration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Now the source in Lesotho who gave this </p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a>information, had he been used by you for quite some time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Booyens, when you come to a convenient </p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a>point, you should tell us, because we should adjourn quarter to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Certainly Mr Chairman, if I can just finish this </p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a>aspect of the source then that would be a convenient stage.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a>information which he had given you in the past, was that reliable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   So you get the information from the source and </p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a>independently of that, you had already monitored conversations, </p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a>intercepted letters etc, and you knew that some of your people had </p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a>physically disappeared and these four people were the only ones who </p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>had known about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You also knew that there was a safety and </p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a>security leak in the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   So these objective facts, did that corroborate the </p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a>information that there were moles in the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   We will continue with paragraph 27 after the </p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a>adjournment.  Mr Chairman, subject to your, what you say, this may </p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>be a convenient stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we will adjourn and resume at eleven </p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a>o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>COMMISSION ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   We are continuing with the evidence of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>Nieuwoudt and Adv Booyens was busy leading him.  You can </p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a>continue Mr Booyens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a>GIDEON JOHANNES NIEUWOUDT:  (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a>EXAMINATION BY ADV BOOYENS:	(cont)  </p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a>	Thank you Mr Chairman.  We go to paragraph 27 on page </p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a>331.  The information which you got that Godji had in early </p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a>December, contacted him about the identification of a police vehicle </p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>from that well placed informer, the same one which gave you the </p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>previous information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And in the same period, there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a>correspondence from Police head quarters which you received that </p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>there was revolutionary planning for the 16th of December which </p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a>was also known as Heroes Day and it also fit in with the information </p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a>that acts of terror were planned for that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You have attached the coded message as per </p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>Annexure 19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The planing of a bomb underneath a Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a>vehicle, it could be argued that you knew that there would be such a </p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a>bomb and that you could have prevented it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>	Would there be a hundred percent chance to stop the bomb </p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a>planter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You then realised that security measures should </p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a>be beefed up before that date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   It will be suggested to you that the information </p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a>had already all come out, in other words the horse had already been </p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a>bolted, why now close the stable door and for that reason it wasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a>necessary to take the drastic actions which ultimately was taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a>	What is your comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I don't think that they were in possession </p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a>of all the information.  I believe that they would have to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a>debriefed for a considerable period and I can give you an example.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a>	When the people apply for asylum in Lesotho, photographs are </p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a>taken of these people so there would have to be a photograph </p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a>identification and that would take time.  They would have to write </p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a>an autobiography of themselves, and that would have to be checked </p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a>first.  So according to me, I don't think they already had all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a>information at their disposal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   One of the methods which you used on this side </p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a>and we have already referred to it, was to have a photo </p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a>identification for people whom you had arrested or turned to find </p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a>out which people they actually knew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Would it be possible for this to happen on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a>other side, on the ANC side if these people had gone over to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a>ANC, for them to have an photo identification to identify further </p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a>sources which they had perhaps seen as Security head offices?</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   According to paragraph 28 you discussed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a>matter with Brigadier Gilbert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   He knew that your intelligence network was </p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a>becoming less effective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And you were already aware of the fact that </p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a>there was a large number or a large amount of sensitive information </p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a>in the ANC's intelligence network's hands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In paragraph 29, you mention that the ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a>could not make use of this information to such a great extent.   It is </p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a>not clear, could you perhaps explain what you mean here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Mr Chairman, the ANC could not use some of </p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a>this information.  Apparently they had not received all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>information and they wanted to ensure they could not act </p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a>immediately, to also protect their own sources.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In other words, if the ANC acted too sharply, </p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a>then the inference would be that they had sources inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You refer to the situation of the possible transfer </p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a>that could exert pressure on Security people because it cold become </p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a>known that there were moles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   In paragraph 31, you refer to the fact that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a>and Mr Gilbert discussed the matter and it was clear that drastic </p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a>measures were needed since the intelligence unit could not be </p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a>utilised to maximum efficiency in the struggle at that time?  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a>efficiency was decreasing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   After all these facts had been placed before him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>Brigadier Gilbert told you that you should eliminate the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You mentioned that the second sentence should </p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a>read he according proposed that this operation be managed in such a </p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a>way that the blame for the elimination could be placed on the ANC's </p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a>shoulders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Because as it reads at the moment, it sounds as </p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a>if it was your suggestion, but it was actually his suggestion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The decision to eliminate the people ... </p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a>(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, which sentence are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Sorry Mr Chairman, paragraph 32 should read he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a>accordingly suggested to me, not I suggested to him.   The roles are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a>just reversed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Could he perhaps explain to us how this fault </p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a>happened, how this occurred that this sentence appears in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a>documents, it has a completely different interpretation and if you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a>want to retract it, you must realise it has been done under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Yes, I am aware of that.  I am not sure how the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a>mistake happened, but it had to have happened during the drafting of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a>these documents.  I noticed the mistake when I went through the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a>documents  during consultation with my client and during </p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a>consultation he told me that the suggestion that the operation should </p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a>take place in this place, had come from Gilbert and not from his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a>side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a>	Unfortunately I cannot answer as to how the mistake crept in. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a> In a document as weighty as this, I am sure mistakes occur.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   The mistake does not lie in the misprint, but in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a>the version itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Yes, Mr Chairman.  On page 334, paragraph 33 </p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a>you mention that the fact that the decision was made to eliminate the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a>people, wasn't taken lightly.  Were you convinced that in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a>circumstances there were no other way than to eliminate these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a>double agents or moles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You were given an order by Brigadier Gilbert </p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a>that it should be done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I received a direct order from Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a>Gilbert.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   On page 334, paragraph 34, you refer to the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a>that as a result of this, Brigadier Gilbert told you that you should </p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a>commence provisional planning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You already realised at that stage that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a>couldn't use local personnel to actually carry out the elimination and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>that you would have to get help from outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Approximately two days after the order had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a>given, Brigadier Gilbert met you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And he arranged for you to fly to Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did he also give the order that the authorization </p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a>should be obtained for the plane ticket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Could you arrange for the authorization yourself </p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a>or did it have to be done through the Commanding Officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   The latter, it had to be done by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a>Commanding Officer himself and he had to get authorization from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a>head office to give that authorization.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In so far as it is relevant, the requisition order is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a>available on which it appears that General Van der Merwe gave </p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a>authorization for the plane ticket, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   We've only got one copy available Mr Chairman, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a>perhaps I could just hand that to the Commission of the requisition. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a> It is part of a court record.  Your secretary could perhaps just make </p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a>copies for us and I will hand it in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a>	Brigadier Gilbert told you to go to Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And the Brigadier Van Rensburg, the first </p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a>witness that you should come into contact with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   That would happen the next day?  Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a>Gilbert also told you that there were allegations that two of these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a>people Mgoduka and Sehati were involved in certain fraud </p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a>allegations, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   These allegations of fraud, did it have anything </p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a>to do with the decision to eliminate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Do you confirm what is said in paragraph 35?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The afternoon of the 12th of December you flew </p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a>to Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Let me put it in this way, Mr Van Rensburg says </p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a>that you arrived at his house at six o'clock that morning.  Why was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a>it done at such a strange time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I received instructions from Brigadier Gilbert </p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a>that I had to make contact with him early the morning at his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You did not know what the reason for that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a>arrangement was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You then arranged through a police contact and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a>the morning of the 13th of December you went to Brigadier Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a>Rensburg's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You knew Mr Van Rensburg since his days in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a>Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And at that time he was the Commanding Officer </p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a>of C10?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Under which Vlakplaas resorted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And in this discussion between you and Gilbert it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a>was mentioned that you should get assistance from outside and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a>mentioned Vlakplaas in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   While you were at Brigadier Van Rensburg's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a>house, Mr De Kock arrived there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you arrive there before Mr De Kock or did </p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a>he arrive afterwards, or did you come there together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I arrived before Mr De Kock at General </p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>Van Rensburg's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And did he tell you what Gilbert had told him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And did you provide him with further </p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a>particulars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you give him a more complete picture of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a>conclusions you have arrived at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And it was suggested that he could possibly </p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a>investigate it himself.  At that stage he wasn't stationed here any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a>more, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And the investigation was an investigation which </p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a>had to be done locally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   At a certain stage, did you tell Brigadier Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a>Rensburg after he had asked you who were the people who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a>involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And did you provide the names of the people to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a>him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The names of all four people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And did he know some of them as he has given </p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a>evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, he knew some of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   After Mr De Kock had arrived there, was he also </p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a>told the reason of this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, we did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Could it have been that only the fraud was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a>mentioned or as it concerns you, a whole picture was given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I can remember we mentioned the fraud.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a>don't know whether it was at an earlier stage before Mr De Kock </p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a>arrived or whether I mentioned it to General Van Rensburg or while </p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a>Mr De Kock was present.  But what I can remember is General Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a>Rensburg told us that he was in a hurry because he had to go to a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a>meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a>	I can't remember exactly in detail what was said.  What I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a>referred to already is that three of these people were involved in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a>Goniwe and I mentioned their names regarding that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And the fact that they were double agents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   And the fact that they were double agents, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did Brigadier Van Rensburg as he has testified, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a>did he give instructions to Mr De Kock to assist you in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you and Mr De Kock then leave Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a>Rensburg's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I accompanied Mr De Kock to his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you walk or did you go by car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   We walked, because the distance from Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a>Rensburg's house to De Kock's house was a short distance.  It is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a>about 50 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you have transport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you go with Mr De Kock in his vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you go to the technical support system </p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a>where you met Waal du Toit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And then a discussion took place regarding the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a>detail of this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In other words that was just a technical </p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a>discussion of how this should be executed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Afterwards you and Colonel De Kock left for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a>Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And there, like you mentioned in paragraph 39, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a>he said to Vermeulen, Snyman and Ras, he gave instructions to them </p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a>to accompany you to Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You left on the same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And that evening late you arrived at Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a>Elizabeth and you provided accommodation for them for the night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you know Mr De Kock beforehand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   That is, did you know him personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, that was the first meeting I had with Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a>De Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You confirmed in paragraph 14 that this Jetta </p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a>vehicle which was blown up, that you fetched it from Louis le </p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a>Grange square and made it possible for the bomb to be planted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The bomb was a remote controlled bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And you mention here what happened </p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a>afterwards, further events regarding time and place were discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You also had gathered intelligence that a certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a>terrorist Mandla Makhubela, that he was in 124 Hinza Street in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a>Motherwell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And this information, was this used to instruct </p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a>these four people who had to be eliminated, to go and do </p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a>surveillance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You informed Colonel Roelofse regarding this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a>person in Hinza Street, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Colonel Roelofse was not informed regarding the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a>exact purpose of this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Then you went to New Brighton police station </p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a>and you had discussions with these members.  A photograph of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a>supposed terrorist was shown to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Mgoduka was not present.  You made </p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a>arrangements to go and fetch him from his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And from there telephone calls were made with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a>his Divisional Commander and you told his Divisional Commander </p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a>that he must come to work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You decided that they would not use the usual </p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a>vehicle because it was part of observation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Faku recommended this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And you told the applicant Mr Lotz that he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a>to bring the Volkswagen Jetta to a certain point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You say that this vehicle had a SAP registration. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a> That wasn't on the number plate, it was a false number plate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Page 339, paragraph 46.  Did you arrange that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>these four members, I am sorry, we are still busy with Mr Lotz.  Did </p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a>Mr Lotz have any previous knowledge of this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   After he had left the vehicle there, the bomb had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a>to be put there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Was that after he had left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   If  I remember correctly, Mr Snyman and I had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a>a discussion with Mr Lotz and at that stage, Martiens Ras activated </p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a>the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The four deceased arrived there at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a>Motherwell crossing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   They got into the vehicle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   They got into the Jetta?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   That is paragraph 48.  It was round about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a>23h50?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   After they had driven for about 100 metres, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a>activated the sender and an explosion took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You also mention on page 341 that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a>investigated the scene and you found a VZD3M detonator there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Was this from the Eastern Block?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   In other words this was used by infiltrators?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Messrs Snyman and Ras did not have any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a>knowledge of that?  You did that on your own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Just by the way, you detonated the bomb?  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a>pushed the button?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you have a problem doing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I was hesitant to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Because those were my colleagues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you that same evening contact Colonel </p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a>Gilbert?  At a certain stage Mgoduka was not present and at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a>stage did you make contact with Brigadier Gilbert again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Initially it seemed that only three of these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a>victims would have been there?  What did you discuss with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I told him that because Mgoduka was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a>there, he was not working, I suggested that we should postpone this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a>operation and he pertinently instructed me that I have to go and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a>fetch Mgoduka from his house and that he had to accompany them as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a>well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   After this explosion, did you mention it on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a>radio that there had been this explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Mr Lotz came back to the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And he realised that the motor vehicle that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a>had driven a little while ago, had been blown up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   What did you tell him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   He was shocked and I told him that this was an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a>authorised operation for which head quarters had given permission </p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a>and he should not worry about this any more and he should keep </p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a>quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The statement that you make that head quarters </p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a>gave permission.  Was that based on what Gilbert had told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   So Gilbert, before you went to Pretoria, he told </p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a>you that he had cleared this whole matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You made false statements in which you blamed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a>the ANC for this explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And this became part of the inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Justice took its course and then eventually you, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a>Mr Du Toit and Mr Ras were convicted for these murders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You have already described your broad political </p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a>view points, but let us come back to the purpose, specifically the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a>political purpose you wished to obtain with this specific case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a>	As you have understood it, what was the function of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a>Security Branch, in other words what was the basis of the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a>Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was the protection of the government of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a>the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And to execute this task, the Security Branch </p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a>had to gather intelligence for this purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The fact that this intelligence network was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a>negatively influenced, would this effect the ability to protect the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a>government of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It would, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And would it in the end make impossible the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a>purpose to protect the government of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And you regarded it as your task and as your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a>duty to prevent something like that, in other words the overthrowing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a>of the government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Did you support the government of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And did you believe that it was necessary that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a>you should act in such a way under these circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Why kill these people, why not less drastic </p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a>measures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was for the protection of the intelligence </p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a>network.  For the protection of the government of the day, that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a>should not be overthrown by violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Would detention by virtue of security regulations </p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a>Section 29, of the Internal Security Act, why according to you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a>would it not have worked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I feel that they would still have been able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a>have contact with other police officers wherever they were detained </p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a>and after a while, after an indictment had been served they had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a>access to their legal counsel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And to visitors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   And to visitors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Section 29 detention could not be done all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a>time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You could not have kept them there for an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a>unlimited time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Were there cases known to you where </p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a>intelligence was smuggled from Section 29 detainees?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   So that could not have worked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Should there have been sufficient evidence to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a>accuse them successfully and send them to jail, would that not have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a>been sufficient because they still would have been able to provide </p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a>the intelligence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   We have already referred to the question of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a>transfer, that would not have worked either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You also refer in more detail to the political </p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a>purpose you wish to achieve on page 48, paragraph 10 (a).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Do you confirm that that is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   And paragraph 10 (b), I think you have already </p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a>referred to that, do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Paragraph 11 (b), just one sentence.  And an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a>instruction from Security head office which was now known to me, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a>you don't know on which Gilbert's assumption that it was cleared by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a>head office was based?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   You did not ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I did not ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   If the Commission would just bear with me Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a>Chairman.  That concludes the evidence Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV BOOYENS.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hugo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:	I am Hugo on behalf of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a>the first applicant.  Mr Nieuwoudt, just a few aspects.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   The first applicant by the way we do it for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a>purpose of, who is the first applicant, Mr De Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a>MR HUGO:   Mr De Kock, Mr Chairman.  That afternoon of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a>12th of December, did you arrive there in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I arrived there that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a>MR HUGO:   Where did you stay that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I stayed in a safe premises in Midrand between </p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a>Johannesburg and Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a>MR HUGO:   What arrangements were made for your transport from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a>the airport to this safe premises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   A person, a certain Sergeant, I can't remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a>his surname, he lived on these premises, he was a guard there and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a>fetched me from the airport that evening.  And from there we went </p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a>to the safe premises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a>MR HUGO:   And I assume that he took you to Nongwe Park the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a>next morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a>MR HUGO:   Having arrived there, did you go directly to Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a>Rensburg's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a>MR HUGO:   How long did this discussion between you and Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a>Rensburg last before De Kock arrived on the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Oh, it was not long.  If I could take a guess </p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a>about four to five minutes.  If I can take a guess, I can't remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a>exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a>MR HUGO:   During this time, did you have enough time to discuss </p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a>the main points of the motivation as discussed by Van Rensburg, to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a>discuss all these things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a>MR HUGO:   During this time before Mr De Kock arrived on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a>scene, did you touch on this aspect of fraud?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It could have been possible, as I have already </p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a>said, I can't remember in which context whether it was before Mr De </p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a>Kock had come there or while he was there, I can't remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a>specifically when that was mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a>MR HUGO:  But you did mention this fraud aspect to Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a>Rensburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a>MR HUGO:   And I believe that Gilbert would have mentioned it to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a>him as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a>MR HUGO:   And then according to your version, Mr De Kock came </p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a>there four or five minutes later.  Did you repeat the motivation </p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a>which you have mentioned to Van Rensburg earlier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a>MR HUGO:   And to the best of your recollection Mr De Kock was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a>also explained this matter of the fraud?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   According to what I can remember, I told him </p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a>that the fraud had complicated this matter even further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a>MR HUGO:   The aspect or the fact that the Goniwe matter was also </p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a>related to this, was that also explained to De Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   The Goniwe matter was mentioned pertinently </p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a>and the three people who were involved in that, I mentioned those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a>people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a>MR HUGO:   I put it to you that Mr De Kock is going to say that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a>when this discussion took place at Van  Rensburg's home, only the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a>fraud aspect was mentioned.  Do you want to react to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, it was not like that.  Mr De Kock is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a>perhaps making a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a>MR HUGO:   Mr De Kock is further going to state that the Goniwe </p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a>matter was for the first time brought under his attention when he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a>returned to Van Rensburg and told him that he had a problem to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a>receive instructions to kill other colleagues only on the basis of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a>fraud?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, it could not have been like that.  What I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a>can distinctly remember is that General Van Rensburg was in a great </p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a>hurry because he had to attend a meeting, or give a lecture at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a>meeting and this is why I draw the inference that Gilbert said I had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a>to meet Van Rensburg at his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a>	That was the only reason I could think of and in any case, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a>did not have transport so I can't understand that Mr De Kock could </p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a>say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Could it not have been that he could have gone </p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a>back to Van Rensburg the next day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That could have been, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Or even later that afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That could be possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a>MR HUGO:   Are you sure that during this discussion where Mr De </p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a>Kock was present, that four people were mentioned who had to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a>eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I am dead sure of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a>MR HUGO:   I am putting it to you that Mr De Kock is going to say </p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a>that during this discussion only two people of the Security Branch </p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a>was mentioned to him.  Two people who had to be eliminated and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a>then also a third person, and as Mr De Kock says in his submission a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a>previous ANC member who was working for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.  I mentioned four people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a>MR HUGO:   Did you during this discussion at Van Rensburg's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a>house, mention the fact that cheques meant for trade union </p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a>organisations were intercepted and these cheques were changed and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a>then the people who had to be eliminated, used it for their own gain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I have no knowledge of this fraud aspect.  All I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a>know is that when I had left, Brigadier Gilbert told me that some of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a>the members were also involved in fraud.  He did not provide any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a>detail at all.  I did not have any knowledge of that.  They were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a>working with me and I don't think it was necessary for Gilbert to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a>mention it to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a>MR HUGO:   I am putting it to you that Mr De Kock is going to say </p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a>that he obtained this information from you and that was the reason </p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a>provided to him, why these people should be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I deny that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a>MR HUGO:   Mr De Kock is also going to say that you said that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a>pressure was exerted on you to accuse these members and that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a>result would be that these people should they be accused of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a>fraud, that these offences would be made public to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I deny this.  I don't believe that Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a>Gilbert would have been able to protect them not to be charged for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a>fraud.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a>MR HUGO:   I just want to ask you one more question.  Can you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a>remember whether Van Rensburg during this discussion you had with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a>him, at one or other stage, left the room to go and make some </p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a>coffee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It could have been like that.  He might have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a>left the room, he was in a great hurry, so I can't remember whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a>that had happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a>MR HUGO:   Mr Nieuwoudt, I am putting it to you that Mr De Kock </p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a>will say that he can't remember that Mr Van Rensburg, and he is sure </p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a>about it, that Mr Van Rensburg did not leave the room at any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a>specific time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I am not dead sure, but it could be that he did </p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a>leave the room at a certain stage, because he was in a great hurry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a>MR HUGO:   How long did this discussion between you, Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a>Rensburg and De Kock last?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   If I have to make an estimate, I did not watch </p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a>my watch, I think about 20 minutes, 20 minutes to half an hour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a>MR HUGO:   So according to you, this discussion was completed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a>round about half past six that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a>MR HUGO:   And according to you, you accompanied Mr De Kock </p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a>directly from there to the technical division.  At what stage did the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a>members, let me rather rephrase, at what time did the members there </p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a>start working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Their working hours started quarter past </p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a>seven, half past seven, that was normal practice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a>MR HUGO:   The offices, were they opened when you arrived there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, when we arrived there I met Mr Du Toit </p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a>for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a>MR HUGO:   But my question is office hours start at quarter past </p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a>seven, half past seven, your discussion lasted half an hour and you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a>said you left immediately for the technical division.  I want to know </p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a>where these offices already open and were they open, why so early?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   They were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Do you know how far this technical division is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a>from Van Rensburg's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It is far.  It is near the police college, it is on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a>the northern side of Pretoria and General Van Rensburg lived on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a>southern side of Pretoria, near the University.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a>MR HUGO:   I want to put it to you that Mr De Kock is going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a>say that his recollection is that he used his own transport to go to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a>police head quarters and there he contacted Van Rensburg again and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a>there he made arrangements with the technical division?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a>MR HUGO:   Mr Chairman, just give me one moment please.  ADV </p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a>DE JAGER:   Mr Hugo, could you perhaps give us an indication how </p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a>far is the house and the technical department, how far are they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a>apart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a>MR HUGO:   Mr Chairman,  if you can give me a minute just to get </p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a>instructions on this point.  Mr Nieuwoudt, I put it to you that Mr De </p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a>Kock will say that at that time in the morning, bearing in mind the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a>traffic at that stage, it would take about ten to twelve minutes to go </p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a>from General Van Rensburg's premises to the technical division?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a>Can you comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I can't deny that, but all that I know is that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a>De Kock went round to his house, if I remember correctly, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a>collected his moonbag, greeted his wife and it was then that I met </p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a>his wife for the first time and from there we departed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a>	Because how would I have gotten there, I didn't have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a>transport at my disposal and I didn't personally know Mr Waal du </p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a>Toit at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a>MR HUGO:   I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HUGO.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Lamey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LAMEY:	Thank you Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a>Chairman.  I represent Mr Lionel Snyman and I have a few questions </p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a>to ask to Mr Nieuwoudt.  Mr Nieuwoudt, did you and Colonel De </p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a>Kock leave the technical division together on your way to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a>Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a>MR LAMEY:   Is it correct that Mr Vermeulen, Martiens Ras had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a>been summoned to Colonel De Kock's office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Please repeat the question, I didn't hear it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a>properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a>MR LAMEY:   Is it correct that after you and Colonel De Kock </p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a>arrived at Vlakplaas, that Mr Vermeulen and Ras and Snyman had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a>been summoned to Colonel De Kock's office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a>MR LAMEY:   Were you there introduced to these three people, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a>Snyman, Vermeulen and Ras?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a>MR LAMEY:   Is it possible that during this discussion, mention was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a>made by yourself of by De Kock that you had come from head </p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a>office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I can't remember that specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a>MR LAMEY:   What was the communication made to Ras, Snyman </p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a>and Vermeulen when they were summoned to the office, what was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a>said to them?  Was an explanation about the nature of the operation </p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a>given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a>MR LAMEY:   Was that done at a later stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, it was done later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a>MR LAMEY:   Where did that take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That could have been during our journey from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a>Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a>MR LAMEY:   Was it discussed in more detail then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Not in depth, no details were given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a>MR LAMEY:   Mr Snyman's evidence and his affidavit says that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a>Colonel De Kock mentioned that Deon, that is yourself, would later </p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a>tell everything, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a>MR LAMEY:   Was mention made of trouble caused by a member or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a>an askari during this discussion at Vlakplaas with Vermeulen and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a>Ras?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Not as far as I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a>MR LAMEY:   What can you remember relating to the operation, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a>nature of the operation and the motive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   There wasn't much discussion at Vlakplaas.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a>was introduced to the members and I stood outside and I waited.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a>waited to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a>MR LAMEY:   Are you saying there wasn't very much time for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a>discussions at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, we didn't spend much time there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a>MR LAMEY:   Mr Snyman's recollection is that there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a>recollection of an askari who had been causing trouble and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a>something had to be done about it and that mention was made of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a>money that had been stolen and that he was a threat, a risk to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a>other Security Branch members and that he had to go back to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a>ANC, can you recall anything like that being discussed at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Not at Vlakplaas.  As I have said, it could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a>taken place whilst we were driving.  And perhaps I then told them, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a>not in detail, the purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a>MR LAMEY:   Are you saying that you later mentioned the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a>motivation for this operation, later when you left Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.  It could have been mentioned by Mr De </p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a>Kock but I didn't hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a>MR LAMEY:   What exactly was told to these people on the way to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a>Port Elizabeth, relating to the motive for the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I think I told them that they were playing a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a>double role, and as a result thereof they had put out feelers to go </p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a>over to the ANC and that on the 16th of December, there was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a>plan to place a landmine in one of the vehicles and that they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a>also involved in sensitive operations, some of the members. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a>	And that they had also committed fraud, that is all, because I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a>had no details about the fraud.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a>MR LAMEY:   Snyman's recollection is also that he had already at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a>Vlakplaas gained the impression that it was to be an organised </p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a>operation since members of the technical division were involved.  Do </p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a>you know whether that was mentioned then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It could have been mentioned by Mr De Kock, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a>I didn't mention it, but that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a>MR LAMEY:   Snyman says that he also thought and that his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a>recollection was that you at some point mentioned that you had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a>flown to Pretoria to discuss the situation in Port Elizabeth with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a>General and he will testify that that was General Van Rensburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a>MR LAMEY:   In Port Elizabeth, Mr Du Toit and members of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a>technical division were mainly involved in the installation of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a>explosive device in the vehicle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a>MR LAMEY:   But that Mr Snyman and Vermeulen and Ras, their </p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a>task was mainly guard duty or to secure the surrounding area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a>MR LAMEY:   Snyman also says that he from time to time helped </p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a>with the explosives, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a>MR LAMEY:   And then is it also correct that on the scene where </p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a>the explosion eventually happened, that Snyman and Ras' role was to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a>stand near the crossing and that they had been tasked in case </p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a>something went wrong with the explosion, to shoot the persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a>MR LAMEY:   Were these details discussed beforehand in Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a>Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a>MR LAMEY:   How would Snyman and Ras have known that that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a>was to be their role?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I think that their Commanding Officer would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a>have informed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a>MR LAMEY:   Weren't they taken to the meeting place beforehand </p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a>to see where it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I took them there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a>MR LAMEY:   Thank you Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LAMEY.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   What was the purpose of taking them there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Because they didn't know the area and we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a>only supposed to meet there that evening and I therefore arranged to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a>see the deceased at New Brighton and they were to meet at a certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a>time there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Didn't they ask you what are we going to do </p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a>there, to the place where you are taking us to now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I believe that they knew what their task was to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a>be, that they had known that in Pretoria already because their </p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a>Commanding Officer would have told them that if the bomb did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a>explode, they had to take further action by shooting the people.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a>They didn't ask me, they were only supposed to fulfil an auxiliary </p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a>role.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Did you point out specific points where they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a>would have to post themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, that they observed for themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   What did you mean when you told them that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a>the people to be eliminated, had put out feelers to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   What I meant was that they had already made </p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a>contact with the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   In what way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   In the sense that they had been recruited by a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a>member of MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Why didn't you tell them?  Why didn't you tell </p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a>them that the people had been recruited?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I said, I didn't go into any detail.  All I said </p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a>was that they had defected, they had put out feelers to the ANC and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a>that they were planning to plant a bomb on the 16th, which was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a>commemoration to show solidarity and that they were playing the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a>role of double agents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a>	And I assumed that they knew what I was referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   No, what I am interested in is what you said </p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a>the feelers that they put out.  You are alleging as a fact in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a>evidence that these people had been recruited and you referred to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a>the Commanding Officer who had recruited them, allegedly, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a>Mgoduka, who had recruited Mgoduka in any event, but you told </p>
<p class="line" id="line1713"><a name="pos1713"></a>these people that these people had put out feelers towards the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1714"><a name="pos1714"></a>	That is something different, if you put out feelers, it is as if </p>
<p class="line" id="line1715"><a name="pos1715"></a>you are still testing the waters, you are trying to make contact and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1716"><a name="pos1716"></a>to establish whether you can cooperate with them, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1717"><a name="pos1717"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1718"><a name="pos1718"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But if you had been recruited, then you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1719"><a name="pos1719"></a>already a part of their structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1720"><a name="pos1720"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1721"><a name="pos1721"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   So what was the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1722"><a name="pos1722"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That they had been recruited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1723"><a name="pos1723"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   They had been recruited?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Ras, Snyman and Vermeulen, did you want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a>mislead them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, that wasn't the intention at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Did you just express yourself incorrectly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is possible, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is that how you expressed yourself to General </p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a>Van Rensburg as well, because - I am asking this because at the end </p>
<p class="line" id="line1732"><a name="pos1732"></a>of General Van Rensburg, it was unclear to me as it had been from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1733"><a name="pos1733"></a>your evidence until my colleague to my left asked you, it had not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1734"><a name="pos1734"></a>been clear to me whether in fact these people had already been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1735"><a name="pos1735"></a>recruited or were in the process of being recruited by the ANC.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1736"><a name="pos1736"></a>How did you express yourself to General Van Rensburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1737"><a name="pos1737"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   If I recall correctly, I told General Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1738"><a name="pos1738"></a>Rensburg that the people had been recruited for the ANC and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1739"><a name="pos1739"></a>they were planning a certain action for the 16th and I further told </p>
<p class="line" id="line1740"><a name="pos1740"></a>him that these people, these three, were involved in a sensitive </p>
<p class="line" id="line1741"><a name="pos1741"></a>operation relating to Goniwe.  That information I got from General </p>
<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a>Gilbert.  And I mentioned the names of all four people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1743"><a name="pos1743"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   You see, the annexure to which you refer on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a>page 327 of the record, paragraph 19 of your application, you refer </p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a>to the document of the inquest proceedings in the case of M. Goniwe </p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a>and three others and that record appears on page 498 of our </p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a>documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a>	It is apparently one of the Advocates representing the parties, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a>Mr Mostert, at the bottom of page 399, he refers to Jack.  He says </p>
<p class="line" id="line1750"><a name="pos1750"></a>Jack was what was called an askari.  And then he explains, in other </p>
<p class="line" id="line1751"><a name="pos1751"></a>words he was a trained ANC activist who at that stage was working </p>
<p class="line" id="line1752"><a name="pos1752"></a>for the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1753"><a name="pos1753"></a>	And he then says but at that stage he had put out feelers to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1754"><a name="pos1754"></a>return to the ANC fold.  Then the court asks him, you say he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1755"><a name="pos1755"></a>put out feelers and then he then says, Mr Mostert then says, he put </p>
<p class="line" id="line1756"><a name="pos1756"></a>out feelers to return to the ANC fold.  My Lord, as far as Mgoduka </p>
<p class="line" id="line1757"><a name="pos1757"></a>is concerned, our information is that in respect of Mgoduka too, his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1758"><a name="pos1758"></a>loyalty was being questioned.  So it is in the same context in which </p>
<p class="line" id="line1759"><a name="pos1759"></a>reference is made to this inquest.  Reference is there also made to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a>the approach to the ANC, putting out feelers as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a>	Now, this extract, could that be corroboration for your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1762"><a name="pos1762"></a>allegation that these people had contact with the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1763"><a name="pos1763"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1764"><a name="pos1764"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But once again to put out feelers, reference is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1765"><a name="pos1765"></a>made to putting out of feelers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1766"><a name="pos1766"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1767"><a name="pos1767"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Was this submission to which you referred us </p>
<p class="line" id="line1768"><a name="pos1768"></a>in the Goniwe inquest, was that also wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1769"><a name="pos1769"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1770"><a name="pos1770"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Why do you then refer us to that in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1771"><a name="pos1771"></a>application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1772"><a name="pos1772"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Because I testified there and it was put to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1773"><a name="pos1773"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But why do you refer us to an extract which </p>
<p class="line" id="line1774"><a name="pos1774"></a>says that Mr Jack, the askari, had put out feelers to the ANC and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1775"><a name="pos1775"></a>that Mr Mgoduka's loyalty was being questioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1776"><a name="pos1776"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I annexed that as corroboration of the facts  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1777"><a name="pos1777"></a>already sketched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1778"><a name="pos1778"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But that cannot be corroboration of what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1779"><a name="pos1779"></a>allege.  You are saying that the people were recruited?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1780"><a name="pos1780"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   But it could have been beforehand, before they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1781"><a name="pos1781"></a>were actually recruited in the follow up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1782"><a name="pos1782"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But in your application at page 327, why didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1783"><a name="pos1783"></a>you say I refer you to the record, but that record is wrong, it wasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1784"><a name="pos1784"></a>a question of putting out feelers, the people were actually recruited?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1785"><a name="pos1785"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, but that was only at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1786"><a name="pos1786"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   That what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1787"><a name="pos1787"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   When they were recruited.  They went through </p>
<p class="line" id="line1788"><a name="pos1788"></a>a whole process.  They also had to be screened first before they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1789"><a name="pos1789"></a>were accepted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1790"><a name="pos1790"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1791"><a name="pos1791"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   On the 13th, what time did you leave Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1792"><a name="pos1792"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   If I remember correctly, it was approximately </p>
<p class="line" id="line1793"><a name="pos1793"></a>eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1794"><a name="pos1794"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   And what time did you arrive at Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1795"><a name="pos1795"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I think it was about 10, 12 hours' journey, so it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1796"><a name="pos1796"></a>would have been round about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1797"><a name="pos1797"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Lamey, can I just for clarity, when you put </p>
<p class="line" id="line1798"><a name="pos1798"></a>questions to the witness, you put it to him that Mr Snyman will say </p>
<p class="line" id="line1799"><a name="pos1799"></a>quite a few things and one of the things that you said he would say </p>
<p class="line" id="line1800"><a name="pos1800"></a>was that an askari was mentioned and that he caused trouble etc, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a>etc.   What is not clear to me is this askari, when you said an askari </p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a>was mentioned at Vlakplaas and that he caused trouble, was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a>askari who caused trouble in Vlakplaas or is it the askari that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a>talked about in PE?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1805"><a name="pos1805"></a>MR LAMEY:   No, Mr Chairman, it is referring to an askari in Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line1806"><a name="pos1806"></a>Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1807"><a name="pos1807"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I see, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1808"><a name="pos1808"></a>FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LAMEY:   Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a>Chairman, may I just proceed to ask one further question to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a>applicant?  Mr Nieuwoudt, on the basis of the information and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a>statements made, and I refer specifically to Mr Snyman, would you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1812"><a name="pos1812"></a>agree that Mr Snyman had every reason to believe that based on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a>your communications that this operation in which they were going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a>assist and play a supportive role, that this operation had to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a>carried out in the national interest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Most definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1817"><a name="pos1817"></a>MR LAMEY:   Thank you Mr Chairman, I have got no further </p>
<p class="line" id="line1818"><a name="pos1818"></a>questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1819"><a name="pos1819"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LAMEY.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Could you just clarify one point for me.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a>said you took them out to the place during the afternoon and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a>they chose their own positions there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   And the would then have to act if there was no </p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a>successful explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   So, they would have known where the explosion </p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a>was to take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Did you give them an indication that it would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1831"><a name="pos1831"></a>take place 100 paces from point A or what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1832"><a name="pos1832"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   And did they take up position further on or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a>where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, where the exchange of vehicles took place. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a> It was about 100 metres from that point, that was where the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a>explosion was to take place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   If you had pressed the button a couple of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a>seconds too late, it would have been passed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   So they had to know exactly when you were to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a>press the button to place themselves in the correct position from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1843"><a name="pos1843"></a>where they could still shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1844"><a name="pos1844"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1845"><a name="pos1845"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   You say that they chose that positions for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1846"><a name="pos1846"></a>themselves.  They must have been able to chose it from information </p>
<p class="line" id="line1847"><a name="pos1847"></a>which you had given them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1848"><a name="pos1848"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is why I took them to the scene, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1849"><a name="pos1849"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You see, the one thing that I don't understand is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1850"><a name="pos1850"></a>how can you take people to a place they hadn't seen before, you take </p>
<p class="line" id="line1851"><a name="pos1851"></a>them so that they would know where they would put that evening </p>
<p class="line" id="line1852"><a name="pos1852"></a>and they should also determine the positions where they would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1853"><a name="pos1853"></a>to be placed without you, the person who is taking them there to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1854"><a name="pos1854"></a>place that they don't know, discussing with them the purpose of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1855"><a name="pos1855"></a>them being there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1856"><a name="pos1856"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I have already said, I took into account the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1857"><a name="pos1857"></a>fact that their Commanding Officer had told them what role to play </p>
<p class="line" id="line1858"><a name="pos1858"></a>and they were trained people and I took them to the scene and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1859"><a name="pos1859"></a>made their own observations there and they knew in which direction </p>
<p class="line" id="line1860"><a name="pos1860"></a>the vehicle was to travel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1861"><a name="pos1861"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   But when you arrived at that place, what do you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1862"><a name="pos1862"></a>say to them?  As far as they were concerned, that place could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a>been anywhere.  You have gone passed a number of places and you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1864"><a name="pos1864"></a>come to a particular point and what do you say to them, you just </p>
<p class="line" id="line1865"><a name="pos1865"></a>keep quiet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I said that that was where the exchange of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1867"><a name="pos1867"></a>vehicles was to take place.  That is where they would switch the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1868"><a name="pos1868"></a>vehicles, in other words where the Jetta and the kombi were to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1869"><a name="pos1869"></a>switched and the four deceased would then take up their positions in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1870"><a name="pos1870"></a>the Jetta.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1871"><a name="pos1871"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Now, that is what you told them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1872"><a name="pos1872"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1873"><a name="pos1873"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   So that it should make sense?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1874"><a name="pos1874"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1875"><a name="pos1875"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1876"><a name="pos1876"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   And in the direction in which the Jetta was to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1877"><a name="pos1877"></a>travel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1878"><a name="pos1878"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   And that's it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1879"><a name="pos1879"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.  And they were then able to observe the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1880"><a name="pos1880"></a>area and where they could take up their positions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1881"><a name="pos1881"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   But the most important thing for them to know, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1882"><a name="pos1882"></a>was where exactly the explosion was going to take place, 100 paces </p>
<p class="line" id="line1883"><a name="pos1883"></a>or 500 paces away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1884"><a name="pos1884"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   They knew that it was 100 paces, they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1885"><a name="pos1885"></a>present.  It is 100 meter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1886"><a name="pos1886"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Did you tell them that it was going to be 100 </p>
<p class="line" id="line1887"><a name="pos1887"></a>meter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   They were present when we were preparing the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1889"><a name="pos1889"></a>car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1890"><a name="pos1890"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Yes, but the preparation of the car does not tell </p>
<p class="line" id="line1891"><a name="pos1891"></a>them exactly when the car would explode.  They were present during </p>
<p class="line" id="line1892"><a name="pos1892"></a>the preparation, but did you discuss this type of detail, in other </p>
<p class="line" id="line1893"><a name="pos1893"></a>words take up position 200 paces further on and if the thing doesn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1894"><a name="pos1894"></a>explode after 100 metres, then you must shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I didn't discuss it in such detail with them.  But </p>
<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a>it could have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1897"><a name="pos1897"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you speak of so many metres from two </p>
<p class="line" id="line1898"><a name="pos1898"></a>points, what are the two points?  It must be the point where they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1899"><a name="pos1899"></a>would have to place themselves and the point where the explosion is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1900"><a name="pos1900"></a>supposed to take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   That you must have told them, otherwise the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a>whole thing wouldn't make sense.  You must have told them that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a>people are going to be blown up at this point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1905"><a name="pos1905"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Jansen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1907"><a name="pos1907"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV JANSEN:	Thank you Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1908"><a name="pos1908"></a>Chairman.  Jansen is the name on behalf of applicant Marthinus Ras. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1909"><a name="pos1909"></a> Mr Nieuwoudt you were in charge of this operation, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1910"><a name="pos1910"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a>ADV JANSEN:   You would have been aware of the detail of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a>operation right down to the finest details?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a>ADV JANSEN:   You involved head office in the operation because </p>
<p class="line" id="line1915"><a name="pos1915"></a>you didn't have the necessary technical and other facilities, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1916"><a name="pos1916"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1917"><a name="pos1917"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1918"><a name="pos1918"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you say that, Mr Nieuwoudt?  I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a>surprised you agreed to that, unless I misunderstood the evidence?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1920"><a name="pos1920"></a>If you didn't have to make use of technical experts, would you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1921"><a name="pos1921"></a>done, would you have proceeded with the operation without the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1922"><a name="pos1922"></a>head office?  Would you still not have sought the approval of head </p>
<p class="line" id="line1923"><a name="pos1923"></a>office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1924"><a name="pos1924"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, as I understood it, Mr Gilbert made those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1925"><a name="pos1925"></a>arrangements with head office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1926"><a name="pos1926"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he is asking you, why did you involve head </p>
<p class="line" id="line1927"><a name="pos1927"></a>office?  Maybe let me ask you that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Pardon me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1929"><a name="pos1929"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you involve head office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1930"><a name="pos1930"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Because we didn't have the necessary abilities </p>
<p class="line" id="line1931"><a name="pos1931"></a>to plant the bomb, it had to be done in a professional way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Nieuwoudt, you informed Mr Gilbert </p>
<p class="line" id="line1933"><a name="pos1933"></a>because he was your senior and you expected Mr Gilbert to get an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1934"><a name="pos1934"></a>approval from head office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1935"><a name="pos1935"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1936"><a name="pos1936"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   And whether or not you would have used </p>
<p class="line" id="line1937"><a name="pos1937"></a>whatever method or whatever, you would still have tried to make </p>
<p class="line" id="line1938"><a name="pos1938"></a>sure that you got the necessary approval, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1939"><a name="pos1939"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1940"><a name="pos1940"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Jansen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1941"><a name="pos1941"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Nieuwoudt, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1942"><a name="pos1942"></a>knew very well what support you  required from head quarters, in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1943"><a name="pos1943"></a>other words what was it that they had which you did not have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1944"><a name="pos1944"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It is like that, we did not have the necessary </p>
<p class="line" id="line1945"><a name="pos1945"></a>capacity, but the arrangements were made with Brigadier Gilbert </p>
<p class="line" id="line1946"><a name="pos1946"></a>with head quarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1947"><a name="pos1947"></a>ADV JANSEN:   You have just mentioned in answer to a question </p>
<p class="line" id="line1948"><a name="pos1948"></a>from the Chairman, that you did not have the capacity to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1949"><a name="pos1949"></a>manufacture the bomb, to plant the bomb.  At that stage you already </p>
<p class="line" id="line1950"><a name="pos1950"></a>knew that a bomb would be involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1951"><a name="pos1951"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is so, yes, because Gilbert had told me </p>
<p class="line" id="line1952"><a name="pos1952"></a>that we should create the impression that the ANC was responsible </p>
<p class="line" id="line1953"><a name="pos1953"></a>for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1954"><a name="pos1954"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Yes, but that could mean a lot of things.  It usually </p>
<p class="line" id="line1955"><a name="pos1955"></a>means that Makarov pistols had to be used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1956"><a name="pos1956"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is like that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1957"><a name="pos1957"></a>ADV JANSEN:   At which do you say the method or the manner of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1958"><a name="pos1958"></a>elimination, at what stage was that discussed with you for the first </p>
<p class="line" id="line1959"><a name="pos1959"></a>time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1960"><a name="pos1960"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was when Gilbert gave me a direct </p>
<p class="line" id="line1961"><a name="pos1961"></a>instruction and he told me that we had to use a limpet mine to create </p>
<p class="line" id="line1962"><a name="pos1962"></a>the impression that the ANC was responsible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1963"><a name="pos1963"></a>ADV JANSEN:   The planning had already been done, and that was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1964"><a name="pos1964"></a>even before there was contact with head office on the 12th of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1965"><a name="pos1965"></a>December?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1966"><a name="pos1966"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I don't know whether he had already cleared </p>
<p class="line" id="line1967"><a name="pos1967"></a>this matter with head office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1968"><a name="pos1968"></a>ADV JANSEN:   I want to correct myself, I am not referring to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1969"><a name="pos1969"></a>contact with head office, but I am referring to contact with Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1970"><a name="pos1970"></a>Rensburg.  Those discussions had to take place before you left Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line1971"><a name="pos1971"></a>Elizabeth with Gilbert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1972"><a name="pos1972"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1973"><a name="pos1973"></a>ADV JANSEN:   In other words the details of what the operation </p>
<p class="line" id="line1974"><a name="pos1974"></a>would physically entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1975"><a name="pos1975"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   All I can remember what Gilbert told me </p>
<p class="line" id="line1976"><a name="pos1976"></a>regarding the limpet mine, that it should appear as if the ANC was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1977"><a name="pos1977"></a>responsible.  That was all, he did not discuss any detail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1978"><a name="pos1978"></a>ADV JANSEN:   At least he wanted a bomb to be used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1979"><a name="pos1979"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1980"><a name="pos1980"></a>ADV JANSEN:   And it could mean only one thing, the bomb had to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1981"><a name="pos1981"></a>be attached to a car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1982"><a name="pos1982"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1983"><a name="pos1983"></a>ADV JANSEN:   In other words a car had to be involved as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1984"><a name="pos1984"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1985"><a name="pos1985"></a>ADV JANSEN:   And the person who had to be eliminated, you had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1986"><a name="pos1986"></a>to get them into the car in one or other way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1987"><a name="pos1987"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1988"><a name="pos1988"></a>ADV JANSEN:   That detail also had to be finalised before you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1989"><a name="pos1989"></a>came to Pretoria, or perhaps you had good ideas regarding this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1990"><a name="pos1990"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1991"><a name="pos1991"></a>ADV JANSEN:   You see, it is clear that shortly after these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1992"><a name="pos1992"></a>discussions on the 13th, definite plans regarding a certain plan B had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1993"><a name="pos1993"></a>been made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1994"><a name="pos1994"></a>	Vlakplaas operatives Ras, Snyman and Vermeulen were given </p>
<p class="line" id="line1995"><a name="pos1995"></a>Makarov pistols or they took their own Makarov pistols, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1996"><a name="pos1996"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1997"><a name="pos1997"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1998"><a name="pos1998"></a>ADV JANSEN:   You knew about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1999"><a name="pos1999"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2000"><a name="pos2000"></a>ADV JANSEN:   So at that stage you wee aware what plan B </p>
<p class="line" id="line2001"><a name="pos2001"></a>entailed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2002"><a name="pos2002"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I can't remember that it was explained to me, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2003"><a name="pos2003"></a>but what I know is that they had to support this operation should </p>
<p class="line" id="line2004"><a name="pos2004"></a>not bomb not explode.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2005"><a name="pos2005"></a>ADV JANSEN:   What support would these three people be able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2006"><a name="pos2006"></a>give at that stage?   In other words the morning of the 13th, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line2007"><a name="pos2007"></a>did you think their role had to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2008"><a name="pos2008"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I can't remember regarding what they thought </p>
<p class="line" id="line2009"><a name="pos2009"></a>or what Mr De Kock thought by sending them with, but all I know is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2010"><a name="pos2010"></a>we have already cleared it out at the technical division.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2011"><a name="pos2011"></a>ADV JANSEN:   All right, I want to tell you what Mr Ras says.  Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2012"><a name="pos2012"></a>Ras says  regarding that aspect in the first place, it was clear to him </p>
<p class="line" id="line2013"><a name="pos2013"></a>that the detail of the plan already had been finalised, because they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2014"><a name="pos2014"></a>were aware that the technical division would become involved.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line2015"><a name="pos2015"></a>won't have a problem with that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2016"><a name="pos2016"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, that is correct, that is how I accepted that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2017"><a name="pos2017"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Once again he says he can't remember where he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2018"><a name="pos2018"></a>was told this, but he did know that their support would entail firstly </p>
<p class="line" id="line2019"><a name="pos2019"></a>that they would put these explosive devices on the scene.  Because </p>
<p class="line" id="line2020"><a name="pos2020"></a>all three of them completed the explosives course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2021"><a name="pos2021"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2022"><a name="pos2022"></a>ADV JANSEN:   And furthermore, they would be part of this plan B </p>
<p class="line" id="line2023"><a name="pos2023"></a>if the explosives device did not work, they had to eliminate these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2024"><a name="pos2024"></a>people by shooting them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2025"><a name="pos2025"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2026"><a name="pos2026"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Would you then at least agree that all this detail </p>
<p class="line" id="line2027"><a name="pos2027"></a>had been finalised to a great extent before these three people were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2028"><a name="pos2028"></a>called in and told that they had to become involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2029"><a name="pos2029"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2030"><a name="pos2030"></a>ADV JANSEN:   And they were not in a position to change the basic </p>
<p class="line" id="line2031"><a name="pos2031"></a>planning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2032"><a name="pos2032"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2033"><a name="pos2033"></a>ADV JANSEN:   The consideration of which operatives had to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2034"><a name="pos2034"></a>chosen for a specific operation, depended on the type of planning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2035"><a name="pos2035"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2036"><a name="pos2036"></a>ADV JANSEN:   It was certainly also at a very early stage clear for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2037"><a name="pos2037"></a>these people, that this operation entailed the elimination of police </p>
<p class="line" id="line2038"><a name="pos2038"></a>officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2039"><a name="pos2039"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2040"><a name="pos2040"></a>ADV JANSEN:   So this was an extraordinary situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2041"><a name="pos2041"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2042"><a name="pos2042"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Mr Ras says in the first place that he can </p>
<p class="line" id="line2043"><a name="pos2043"></a>specifically remember that the morning of the 13th, he was with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2044"><a name="pos2044"></a>Brigadier Van Rensburg in his office together with Eugene de Kock, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2045"><a name="pos2045"></a>that was for a very short time, and he was then told that he had to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2046"><a name="pos2046"></a>go to Port Elizabeth for an operation.  Do you wish to comment on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2047"><a name="pos2047"></a>that part of his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2048"><a name="pos2048"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I can't remember before we left to Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line2049"><a name="pos2049"></a>Elizabeth, that Mr De Kock had left Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2050"><a name="pos2050"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Mr Ras says it was the habit of the Commanding </p>
<p class="line" id="line2051"><a name="pos2051"></a>Officer of Vlakplaas and some of the other members, that had to do </p>
<p class="line" id="line2052"><a name="pos2052"></a>business at head quarters to go there early in the morning, round </p>
<p class="line" id="line2053"><a name="pos2053"></a>about seven o'clock and to go to head quarters at Wagtehuis.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2054"><a name="pos2054"></a>suppose you don't really have knowledge about that, but I want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2055"><a name="pos2055"></a>just put it to you because there is this difference in evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2056"><a name="pos2056"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I don't have personal knowledge about </p>
<p class="line" id="line2057"><a name="pos2057"></a>that, but that specific morning I accompanied Mr De Kock to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2058"><a name="pos2058"></a>technical division in Rebecca Street.  I don't know that Mr De Kock </p>
<p class="line" id="line2059"><a name="pos2059"></a>and Martiens went to head quarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2060"><a name="pos2060"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Furthermore Mr Ras states that he then, it appears </p>
<p class="line" id="line2061"><a name="pos2061"></a>from his application, that he then went to Vlakplaas.  He made </p>
<p class="line" id="line2062"><a name="pos2062"></a>preparations and he met in De Kock's office?  You would agree to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2063"><a name="pos2063"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2064"><a name="pos2064"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2065"><a name="pos2065"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Can you remember which detail of the operation </p>
<p class="line" id="line2066"><a name="pos2066"></a>were given to the operatives at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2067"><a name="pos2067"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I can't because Mr De Kock talked to them </p>
<p class="line" id="line2068"><a name="pos2068"></a>all alone.  I was standing outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2069"><a name="pos2069"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Mr De Kock surely knew how long they would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2070"><a name="pos2070"></a>remain in Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2071"><a name="pos2071"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I assumed he did know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2072"><a name="pos2072"></a>ADV JANSEN:   How did Mr De Kock know how long they would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2073"><a name="pos2073"></a>be in Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2074"><a name="pos2074"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2075"><a name="pos2075"></a>ADV JANSEN:   You see one of the most important things of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2076"><a name="pos2076"></a>operation was that as few as possible people should know about </p>
<p class="line" id="line2077"><a name="pos2077"></a>this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2078"><a name="pos2078"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2079"><a name="pos2079"></a>ADV JANSEN:   You see Mr De Kock at that stage, was not the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2080"><a name="pos2080"></a>Commanding Officer of Vlakplaas, Mr Dave Baker was the acting </p>
<p class="line" id="line2081"><a name="pos2081"></a>Commander of Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2082"><a name="pos2082"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I can't deny that, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2083"><a name="pos2083"></a>ADV JANSEN:   The point is Mr Nieuwoudt, even some of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2084"><a name="pos2084"></a>senior colleagues were not told the detail of why these operatives </p>
<p class="line" id="line2085"><a name="pos2085"></a>were absent, in other words it is important to know how long these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2086"><a name="pos2086"></a>people would be absent, so should enquiries be made about where </p>
<p class="line" id="line2087"><a name="pos2087"></a>the people were, that these questions could be answered, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2088"><a name="pos2088"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2089"><a name="pos2089"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2090"><a name="pos2090"></a>ADV JANSEN:   In other words you should have told De Kock at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2091"><a name="pos2091"></a>which stage, for when this operation was planned and when the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2092"><a name="pos2092"></a>operatives would be back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2093"><a name="pos2093"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As far as I can remember, we were in Du Toit's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2094"><a name="pos2094"></a>office when we discussed the method and then he could have made </p>
<p class="line" id="line2095"><a name="pos2095"></a>the observation or drew the inference how long this would take.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2096"><a name="pos2096"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   In Du Toit's office did you discuss that Du Toit </p>
<p class="line" id="line2097"><a name="pos2097"></a>and them had to go to PE that same afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2098"><a name="pos2098"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2099"><a name="pos2099"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   And was it discussed there that it was planned </p>
<p class="line" id="line2100"><a name="pos2100"></a>for the night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2101"><a name="pos2101"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was planned for the following day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2102"><a name="pos2102"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2103"><a name="pos2103"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2104"><a name="pos2104"></a>ADV JANSEN:   And you must have been relatively sure that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2105"><a name="pos2105"></a>targets would be available for elimination the next day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2106"><a name="pos2106"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2107"><a name="pos2107"></a>ADV JANSEN:   You see, Mr Ras says that although he did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2108"><a name="pos2108"></a>know all the detail, but his general impression of the whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line2109"><a name="pos2109"></a>operation was that it was very urgent.  Was that a fair observation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2110"><a name="pos2110"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2111"><a name="pos2111"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Secondly that it was extraordinary circumstances </p>
<p class="line" id="line2112"><a name="pos2112"></a>because there was a security breach in the Eastern Cape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2113"><a name="pos2113"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2114"><a name="pos2114"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Mr Ras also says in the journey to Port Elizabeth, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2115"><a name="pos2115"></a>because the two of you were in the same vehicle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2116"><a name="pos2116"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2117"><a name="pos2117"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Snyman and Vermeulen were in another car, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2118"><a name="pos2118"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2119"><a name="pos2119"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2120"><a name="pos2120"></a>ADV JANSEN:   And he says the merit of the operation was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2121"><a name="pos2121"></a>discussed in broad terms, but he can't remember the detail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2122"><a name="pos2122"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2123"><a name="pos2123"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Furthermore Mr Ras states that as far as he can </p>
<p class="line" id="line2124"><a name="pos2124"></a>recall the scene, the so-called plan B would entail that should the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2125"><a name="pos2125"></a>explosive device not be detonated, they would have waited for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2126"><a name="pos2126"></a>members to do the so-called observation tasks in Motherwell and on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2127"><a name="pos2127"></a>returning, that would possible be early the morning, just before or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2128"><a name="pos2128"></a>during the sun came up, that at that stage they would be shot.  Do </p>
<p class="line" id="line2129"><a name="pos2129"></a>you want to comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2130"><a name="pos2130"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It could have been like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2131"><a name="pos2131"></a>ADV JANSEN:   You would agree that when those plans were made, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2132"><a name="pos2132"></a>you did make such a plan or agreed to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2133"><a name="pos2133"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2134"><a name="pos2134"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Jansen, what is your difficulty?  Earlier on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2135"><a name="pos2135"></a>you put it to the witness that your clients could not have been in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2136"><a name="pos2136"></a>position to change any aspect of the plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2137"><a name="pos2137"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2138"><a name="pos2138"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to know what precisely where are we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2139"><a name="pos2139"></a>leading to and what aspect of the matter are you dealing with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2140"><a name="pos2140"></a>ADV JANSEN:   Yes, Mr Chairman, I think it would be clear that as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2141"><a name="pos2141"></a>far as, I think I specifically put the question on the basis that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2142"><a name="pos2142"></a>basic plan or what would be used and the mechanisms, that can't be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2143"><a name="pos2143"></a>changed, but obviously at the end of the day, on the actual ground </p>
<p class="line" id="line2144"><a name="pos2144"></a>and at the scene, the operatives do to some extent use their </p>
<p class="line" id="line2145"><a name="pos2145"></a>discretion, as to how the operation is concluded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2146"><a name="pos2146"></a>	There aren't any specific, my instructions isn't that there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2147"><a name="pos2147"></a>any specific rule as to what they can change and what they can't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2148"><a name="pos2148"></a>change, that will depend on the operation itself to what extent the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2149"><a name="pos2149"></a>operatives have a discretion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2150"><a name="pos2150"></a>	But the planning is done on a more senior level and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2151"><a name="pos2151"></a>planning determines which individuals are more likely to be asked to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2152"><a name="pos2152"></a>be involved, depending on their qualifications and their experience.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2153"><a name="pos2153"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   But plan B never even came into operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2154"><a name="pos2154"></a>ADV JANSEN:   No, it didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2155"><a name="pos2155"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Why should we be detained about around aspects </p>
<p class="line" id="line2156"><a name="pos2156"></a>relating to plan B which didn't even come into operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2157"><a name="pos2157"></a>ADV JANSEN:   No, I accept that Mr Chairman, that it probably </p>
<p class="line" id="line2158"><a name="pos2158"></a>doesn't play much role in the present circumstances.  I am doing it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2159"><a name="pos2159"></a>purely to explain the role of the three Warrant Officers in the fullest </p>
<p class="line" id="line2160"><a name="pos2160"></a>possible sense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2161"><a name="pos2161"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Although I don't think there is much argument </p>
<p class="line" id="line2162"><a name="pos2162"></a>about the role that it was thought they would play and also the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line2163"><a name="pos2163"></a>that they got instructions to pack and go to PE.  They just had to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2164"><a name="pos2164"></a>follow instructions as far as I can see things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2165"><a name="pos2165"></a>ADV JANSEN:   No, I accept that Mr Chairman.  Mr Nieuwoudt, at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2166"><a name="pos2166"></a>the end of the day Mr Ras and the other two Warrant Officers were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2167"><a name="pos2167"></a>under your command in the Eastern Cape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2168"><a name="pos2168"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2169"><a name="pos2169"></a>ADV JANSEN:   And that what they had done, was a direct </p>
<p class="line" id="line2170"><a name="pos2170"></a>consequence of the commands given to them by you or by Mr De </p>
<p class="line" id="line2171"><a name="pos2171"></a>Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2172"><a name="pos2172"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2173"><a name="pos2173"></a>ADV JANSEN:   And there is no doubt that that what was done </p>
<p class="line" id="line2174"><a name="pos2174"></a>would be regarded by them as part of their job or reasonably as part </p>
<p class="line" id="line2175"><a name="pos2175"></a>of their work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2176"><a name="pos2176"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2177"><a name="pos2177"></a>ADV JANSEN:   As it pleases the Chairman, I do not have any </p>
<p class="line" id="line2178"><a name="pos2178"></a>further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2179"><a name="pos2179"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV JANSEN.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2180"><a name="pos2180"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Cornelius?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2181"><a name="pos2181"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR CORNELIUS:   Thank you Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2182"><a name="pos2182"></a>Chairman, Cornelius for the seventh applicant, Mr Vermeulen.   Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2183"><a name="pos2183"></a>Nieuwoudt it is clear that Vermeulen had nothing to do with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2184"><a name="pos2184"></a>handling and the placing of the explosive device?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2185"><a name="pos2185"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2186"><a name="pos2186"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   It was done by Waal du Toit and De Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2187"><a name="pos2187"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2188"><a name="pos2188"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I just want to clear up something which also </p>
<p class="line" id="line2189"><a name="pos2189"></a>bothered Mr De Jager.  The idea is created by you that on the scene </p>
<p class="line" id="line2190"><a name="pos2190"></a>Vermeulen and Snyman made a certain submission should this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2191"><a name="pos2191"></a>operation fail.  I just want to put this straight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2192"><a name="pos2192"></a>	The applicant Vermeulen guarded the motor vehicles where </p>
<p class="line" id="line2193"><a name="pos2193"></a>they were parked, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2194"><a name="pos2194"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2195"><a name="pos2195"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   And if I look at the submissions it was a far way </p>
<p class="line" id="line2196"><a name="pos2196"></a>from the scene where the bomb exploded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2197"><a name="pos2197"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2198"><a name="pos2198"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Such a distance that the applicant will say he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2199"><a name="pos2199"></a>did not even hear the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2200"><a name="pos2200"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2201"><a name="pos2201"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   At that stage when this explosive device was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2202"><a name="pos2202"></a>activated, applicant Vermeulen was out of sight and far from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2203"><a name="pos2203"></a>scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2204"><a name="pos2204"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2205"><a name="pos2205"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   So he was in no position to execute another </p>
<p class="line" id="line2206"><a name="pos2206"></a>plan should this explosion fail and so that he could then eliminate </p>
<p class="line" id="line2207"><a name="pos2207"></a>the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2208"><a name="pos2208"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2209"><a name="pos2209"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I just want to follow on the following, it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2210"><a name="pos2210"></a>clear even from Eugene de Kock's part, that this was cleared at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2211"><a name="pos2211"></a>higher level and that he had to follow your instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2212"><a name="pos2212"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no further </p>
<p class="line" id="line2213"><a name="pos2213"></a>questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2216"><a name="pos2216"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR KEMP:	Mr Chairman, Mr Kemp </p>
<p class="line" id="line2217"><a name="pos2217"></a>on behalf of Du Toit and Kok, the fifth and sixth applicants.  I only </p>
<p class="line" id="line2218"><a name="pos2218"></a>have a few questions to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2219"><a name="pos2219"></a>	The morning you left Nick van Rensburg's house, did you go </p>
<p class="line" id="line2220"><a name="pos2220"></a>directly to the technical division?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2221"><a name="pos2221"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, this is how I recollect it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2222"><a name="pos2222"></a>MR KEMP:   Now, earlier it was put to you that it could have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line2223"><a name="pos2223"></a>around half past six that morning, can you remember more </p>
<p class="line" id="line2224"><a name="pos2224"></a>specifically what time it was that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2225"><a name="pos2225"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I can't remember specifically what time it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2226"><a name="pos2226"></a>was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2227"><a name="pos2227"></a>MR KEMP:   Have you met Mr De Kock previously?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2228"><a name="pos2228"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2229"><a name="pos2229"></a>MR KEMP:   Did you know Mr Du Toit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2230"><a name="pos2230"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2231"><a name="pos2231"></a>MR KEMP:   And Mr Kok?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2232"><a name="pos2232"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2233"><a name="pos2233"></a>MR KEMP:   When you came to the technical division, who did you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2234"><a name="pos2234"></a>meet there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2235"><a name="pos2235"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Mr De Kock took us to Mr Du Toit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2236"><a name="pos2236"></a>MR KEMP:   Is it correct that Mr Kok was not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2237"><a name="pos2237"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2238"><a name="pos2238"></a>MR KEMP:   Mr Kobus Kok?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2239"><a name="pos2239"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2240"><a name="pos2240"></a>MR KEMP:   It was only Mr Du Toit whom I had discussions with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2241"><a name="pos2241"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2242"><a name="pos2242"></a>MR KEMP:   I am stating it to you that Mr Du Toit as he remembers </p>
<p class="line" id="line2243"><a name="pos2243"></a>it, was that this visit took place between ten and eleven o'clock that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2244"><a name="pos2244"></a>morning, but he isn't sure.  Could it have been at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2245"><a name="pos2245"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It is possible, but I can't remember exactly </p>
<p class="line" id="line2246"><a name="pos2246"></a>what time it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2247"><a name="pos2247"></a>MR KEMP:   Did you do anything else that morning before you went </p>
<p class="line" id="line2248"><a name="pos2248"></a>to Vlakplaas, after you had been to the technical division?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2249"><a name="pos2249"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2250"><a name="pos2250"></a>MR KEMP:   One aspect I want to mention to you is that when you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2251"><a name="pos2251"></a>were in the office of Du Toit, you explained to him precisely what </p>
<p class="line" id="line2252"><a name="pos2252"></a>this matter was about, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2253"><a name="pos2253"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2254"><a name="pos2254"></a>MR KEMP:   Did you explain to him the scope of this operation and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2255"><a name="pos2255"></a>the importance of this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2256"><a name="pos2256"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2257"><a name="pos2257"></a>MR KEMP:   And also the urgency?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2258"><a name="pos2258"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2259"><a name="pos2259"></a>MR KEMP:   And De Kock was also present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2260"><a name="pos2260"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2261"><a name="pos2261"></a>MR KEMP:   The question that some of these members were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2262"><a name="pos2262"></a>involved in offences, do you agree that it was never a reason for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2263"><a name="pos2263"></a>eliminating them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2264"><a name="pos2264"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2265"><a name="pos2265"></a>MR KEMP:   Because if they were only guilty of offences, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2266"><a name="pos2266"></a>could have been prosecuted in a normal way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2267"><a name="pos2267"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2268"><a name="pos2268"></a>MR KEMP:   It was because of the results and the threats around </p>
<p class="line" id="line2269"><a name="pos2269"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2270"><a name="pos2270"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2271"><a name="pos2271"></a>MR KEMP:   At which stage did you for the first time meet Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2272"><a name="pos2272"></a>Kobus Kok?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2273"><a name="pos2273"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was early the next day when Mr Du Toit </p>
<p class="line" id="line2274"><a name="pos2274"></a>contacted me that they had arrived in Port Elizabeth.  I met them </p>
<p class="line" id="line2275"><a name="pos2275"></a>and I took them to my safe premises and that was where I met Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2276"><a name="pos2276"></a>Kobus Kok for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2277"><a name="pos2277"></a>MR KEMP:   Is it correct to say that when you arrived at Mr Du </p>
<p class="line" id="line2278"><a name="pos2278"></a>Toit, you and De Kock also realised that the way in which the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2279"><a name="pos2279"></a>people would be eliminated, was by using a motor vehicle with a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2280"><a name="pos2280"></a>bomb in it?    That was conveyed to Du Toit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2281"><a name="pos2281"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2282"><a name="pos2282"></a>MR KEMP:   Was it mentioned that he should come to Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line2283"><a name="pos2283"></a>Elizabeth or just that somebody from his offices should come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2284"><a name="pos2284"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I can't remember exactly whether he had said </p>
<p class="line" id="line2285"><a name="pos2285"></a>or who should come to Port Elizabeth, but it was mentioned that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2286"><a name="pos2286"></a>they should assist us because they were the experts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2287"><a name="pos2287"></a>MR KEMP:   Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2288"><a name="pos2288"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KEMP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2289"><a name="pos2289"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   When you explained to Mr Du Toit in his office, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2290"><a name="pos2290"></a>as to the reason for elimination, how many of you were in there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2291"><a name="pos2291"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was just me, Mr Du Toit and De Kock.  Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2292"><a name="pos2292"></a>Ford.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2293"><a name="pos2293"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV FORD:	Thank you Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2294"><a name="pos2294"></a>Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I see it is one o'clock, do you wish me to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2295"><a name="pos2295"></a>start with the cross-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2296"><a name="pos2296"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   We lost ten minutes around eleven o'clock, let's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2297"><a name="pos2297"></a>go on for the next ten minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2298"><a name="pos2298"></a>ADV FORD:   As it pleases the Chairman.  I am sorry, Ford for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2299"><a name="pos2299"></a>families of the victims Mgoduka and Faku.  Mr Nieuwoudt, you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2300"><a name="pos2300"></a>annexed to your application for amnesty and you have referred to it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2301"><a name="pos2301"></a>in your evidence in chief, a number of documents including </p>
<p class="line" id="line2302"><a name="pos2302"></a>documents from what appeared  to be pamphlets or magazines and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2303"><a name="pos2303"></a>other documents, other portions of what appeared to be books.  Can </p>
<p class="line" id="line2304"><a name="pos2304"></a>I ask you what was the purpose of annexing this documentation?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2305"><a name="pos2305"></a>What did you wish to convey by it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2306"><a name="pos2306"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   This documentation indicates the facts and also </p>
<p class="line" id="line2307"><a name="pos2307"></a>the resistance operations, establishment of revolutionary bases, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2308"><a name="pos2308"></a>necklacing and that is in support of the anarchy which existed, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2309"><a name="pos2309"></a>unrest situation which prevailed and the people's war concept.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2310"><a name="pos2310"></a>ADV FORD:   I see so what you are saying is it was annexed for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2311"><a name="pos2311"></a>substantiation of the facts which you have referred to in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line2312"><a name="pos2312"></a>application.  You are not suggesting that you read all this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2313"><a name="pos2313"></a>documentation before the Motherwell bombing incident and it led </p>
<p class="line" id="line2314"><a name="pos2314"></a>you to certain convictions which influenced your actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2315"><a name="pos2315"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.  Because it was already in existence at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2316"><a name="pos2316"></a>stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2317"><a name="pos2317"></a>ADV FORD:   Had you read any of this documentation prior to that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2318"><a name="pos2318"></a>incident, the Motherwell incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2319"><a name="pos2319"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.  I did read some of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2320"><a name="pos2320"></a>ADV FORD:   Were you continuously involved in obtaining </p>
<p class="line" id="line2321"><a name="pos2321"></a>whatever information there was relating to the ANC, to perusing </p>
<p class="line" id="line2322"><a name="pos2322"></a>that and utilising it where possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2323"><a name="pos2323"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2324"><a name="pos2324"></a>ADV FORD:   Now, just to get some certainty on the hierarchy in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2325"><a name="pos2325"></a>the Security Branch in Port Elizabeth at the time, do I understand </p>
<p class="line" id="line2326"><a name="pos2326"></a>that Brigadier Gilbert was your senior officer at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2327"><a name="pos2327"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   At which stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2328"><a name="pos2328"></a>ADV FORD:   We are talking about the time immediately before, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2329"><a name="pos2329"></a>at the time of the bombing incident, Mr Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2330"><a name="pos2330"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   He was the Divisional Commander of the whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line2331"><a name="pos2331"></a>Eastern Cape region.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2332"><a name="pos2332"></a>ADV FORD:   And you reported directly to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2333"><a name="pos2333"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2334"><a name="pos2334"></a>ADV FORD:   And Colonel Roelofse, what was his position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2335"><a name="pos2335"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Colonel Roelofse at that stage was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2336"><a name="pos2336"></a>Commanding Officer of the Investigative Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2337"><a name="pos2337"></a>ADV FORD:   And Mr Van Wyk, I think it was Captain Van Wyk, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2338"><a name="pos2338"></a>was he also known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2339"><a name="pos2339"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.  He was also part of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2340"><a name="pos2340"></a>Investigative Unit resorting under Roelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2341"><a name="pos2341"></a>ADV FORD:   We know from Mr Van Rensburg's evidence that for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2342"><a name="pos2342"></a>some time, he was stationed in Port Elizabeth and a member of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2343"><a name="pos2343"></a>Security Branch.  You were also in Port Elizabeth at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2344"><a name="pos2344"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2345"><a name="pos2345"></a>ADV FORD:   And were you in any way under his command at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2346"><a name="pos2346"></a>stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2347"><a name="pos2347"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, he was second in charge at that stage.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2348"><a name="pos2348"></a>And at that stage I was under the command of Roelofse and I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2349"><a name="pos2349"></a>assisting the Investigative Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2350"><a name="pos2350"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you ever find it necessary or did you ever on any </p>
<p class="line" id="line2351"><a name="pos2351"></a>occasion bypass you seniors to go to head office in Pretoria for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2352"><a name="pos2352"></a>authority for any operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2353"><a name="pos2353"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2354"><a name="pos2354"></a>ADV FORD:   You would always go through your senior locally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2355"><a name="pos2355"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2356"><a name="pos2356"></a>ADV FORD:   Getting some perspective in so far as the time </p>
<p class="line" id="line2357"><a name="pos2357"></a>sequence is concerned, Mr Nieuwoudt, as I understand it, I think </p>
<p class="line" id="line2358"><a name="pos2358"></a>you refer to it as an Intelligence Unit, or words to that effect, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2359"><a name="pos2359"></a>created in June 1989, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2360"><a name="pos2360"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It is the Intelligence Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2361"><a name="pos2361"></a>ADV FORD:   And you were in charge of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2362"><a name="pos2362"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2363"><a name="pos2363"></a>ADV FORD:   And in respect of the activities of that Unit, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2364"><a name="pos2364"></a>reported directly to Brigadier Gilbert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2365"><a name="pos2365"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2366"><a name="pos2366"></a>ADV FORD:   When was it for the first time, that you identified the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2367"><a name="pos2367"></a>possibility of a leak in that Unit?  Or was it in that Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2368"><a name="pos2368"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was round about August.  But the leak did </p>
<p class="line" id="line2369"><a name="pos2369"></a>not exist only in our division, but also in the whole Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2370"><a name="pos2370"></a>ADV FORD:   I see.  What brought the possibility of a leak to your </p>
<p class="line" id="line2371"><a name="pos2371"></a>attention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2372"><a name="pos2372"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Because of the elimination of some well-placed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2373"><a name="pos2373"></a>informers and also covert operations which I launched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2374"><a name="pos2374"></a>ADV FORD:   And where did these take place, the elimination of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2375"><a name="pos2375"></a>these informants?  Locally or out of the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2376"><a name="pos2376"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Some of them took place locally and others </p>
<p class="line" id="line2377"><a name="pos2377"></a>overseas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2378"><a name="pos2378"></a>ADV FORD:   Now, when did it first come to your attention or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2379"><a name="pos2379"></a>when did you first form the suspicion that Warrant Officer Mgoduka </p>
<p class="line" id="line2380"><a name="pos2380"></a>might be involved in the leak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2381"><a name="pos2381"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was in August 1989 that that suspicion </p>
<p class="line" id="line2382"><a name="pos2382"></a>was caused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2383"><a name="pos2383"></a>ADV FORD:   And what precisely was it that brought your attention </p>
<p class="line" id="line2384"><a name="pos2384"></a>to the possibility of the involvement of Warrant Officer Mgoduka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2385"><a name="pos2385"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was precisely the elimination of my agents.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2386"><a name="pos2386"></a>And also of other members' agents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2387"><a name="pos2387"></a>ADV FORD:   And if I understood your evidence earlier and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2388"><a name="pos2388"></a>application, you then kept these certainly Mr Mgoduka under </p>
<p class="line" id="line2389"><a name="pos2389"></a>observation as a result of that, after discussing it with Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line2390"><a name="pos2390"></a>Gilbert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2391"><a name="pos2391"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2392"><a name="pos2392"></a>ADV FORD:   And how long did it take before you reached some </p>
<p class="line" id="line2393"><a name="pos2393"></a>certainty that in your mind, that Mr Mgoduka was in fact putting out </p>
<p class="line" id="line2394"><a name="pos2394"></a>feelers or in fact had been recruited by the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2395"><a name="pos2395"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was about two weeks, in December, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2396"><a name="pos2396"></a>was a whole process which led to the final stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2397"><a name="pos2397"></a>ADV FORD:   And precisely when was the incident when you allege </p>
<p class="line" id="line2398"><a name="pos2398"></a>that you heard the discussion between the four deceased in the tea </p>
<p class="line" id="line2399"><a name="pos2399"></a>room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2400"><a name="pos2400"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was during that same time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2401"><a name="pos2401"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Nieuwoudt, but precisely when, can you recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2402"><a name="pos2402"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I can't remember the exact date, but the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2403"><a name="pos2403"></a>reports were presented to Gilbert and also the sound recordings </p>
<p class="line" id="line2404"><a name="pos2404"></a>were given to Gilbert, we listened to those.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2405"><a name="pos2405"></a>ADV FORD:   Do you have copies of that documentation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2406"><a name="pos2406"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I do not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2407"><a name="pos2407"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you make a transcript of the tape which you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2408"><a name="pos2408"></a>allege you listened to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2409"><a name="pos2409"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2410"><a name="pos2410"></a>ADV FORD:   Do you know where that is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2411"><a name="pos2411"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I have provided everything to Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line2412"><a name="pos2412"></a>Gilbert.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2413"><a name="pos2413"></a>ADV FORD:   And of course Brigadier Gilbert is now deceased, so </p>
<p class="line" id="line2414"><a name="pos2414"></a>he is not here to answer any of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2415"><a name="pos2415"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2416"><a name="pos2416"></a>ADV FORD:   Now when did you decide, because you returned at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2417"><a name="pos2417"></a>some stage to Brigadier Gilbert, you had decided that the, if I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2418"><a name="pos2418"></a>understand your evidence, that the situation was getting more </p>
<p class="line" id="line2419"><a name="pos2419"></a>critical and that further steps needed to be taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2420"><a name="pos2420"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   This was about two days before my departure </p>
<p class="line" id="line2421"><a name="pos2421"></a>to Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2422"><a name="pos2422"></a>ADV FORD:   Are you aware whether or not Brigadier Gilbert had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2423"><a name="pos2423"></a>discussed this with anybody at head office in Pretoria at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2424"><a name="pos2424"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I don't know, but he assured me that he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2425"><a name="pos2425"></a>received instructions from head quarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2426"><a name="pos2426"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you make any investigations as to what precisely </p>
<p class="line" id="line2427"><a name="pos2427"></a>the order or the instruction, what it covered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2428"><a name="pos2428"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I did not question his instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2429"><a name="pos2429"></a>ADV FORD:   Are you suggesting that when you went back to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2430"><a name="pos2430"></a>Brigadier Gilbert he had already made the decision that these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2431"><a name="pos2431"></a>persons should be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2432"><a name="pos2432"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I would  say so yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2433"><a name="pos2433"></a>ADV FORD:   The allegation has been made and you have agreed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2434"><a name="pos2434"></a>with it, that this matter was extremely serious at that stage.  It was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2435"><a name="pos2435"></a>of great and critical urgency and importance at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2436"><a name="pos2436"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2437"><a name="pos2437"></a>ADV FORD:   You have also suggested that there was a period </p>
<p class="line" id="line2438"><a name="pos2438"></a>during which the post of Mr Mgoduka was being monitored?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2439"><a name="pos2439"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2440"><a name="pos2440"></a>ADV FORD:   Presumably that had taken some time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2441"><a name="pos2441"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2442"><a name="pos2442"></a>ADV FORD:   Over what period of time would that have taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line2443"><a name="pos2443"></a>place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2444"><a name="pos2444"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I think it lasted from August, September up till </p>
<p class="line" id="line2445"><a name="pos2445"></a>November.  It was done continuously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2446"><a name="pos2446"></a>ADV FORD:   Getting to your first suspicion of Mr Mgoduka, was it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2447"><a name="pos2447"></a>a certainty in your mind that he was now leaking information to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2448"><a name="pos2448"></a>ANC or was it merely a suspicion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2449"><a name="pos2449"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   At that stage it was just a suspicion I had, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line2450"><a name="pos2450"></a>when I identified it, I realised that he was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2451"><a name="pos2451"></a>ADV FORD:   All right, can I ask you this.  What precisely was it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2452"><a name="pos2452"></a>that finally convinced you that Mr Mgoduka had turned, that he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2453"><a name="pos2453"></a>conveying information to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2454"><a name="pos2454"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was the information I obtained from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2455"><a name="pos2455"></a>informer that he was recruited by Godji Skenyana.  He was the MK </p>
<p class="line" id="line2456"><a name="pos2456"></a>Commander in the Eastern Cape and that was my confirmation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2457"><a name="pos2457"></a>ADV FORD:   Now, you have suggested that you have intercepted </p>
<p class="line" id="line2458"><a name="pos2458"></a>letters, if I understood your evidence, from Mr Mgoduka, addressed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2459"><a name="pos2459"></a>to these various addresses, the Roma Church, John Smith in London </p>
<p class="line" id="line2460"><a name="pos2460"></a>and two other addresses you mentioned as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2461"><a name="pos2461"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2462"><a name="pos2462"></a>ADV FORD:   How long had Mr Mgoduka been a member of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2463"><a name="pos2463"></a>Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2464"><a name="pos2464"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Since 1977.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2465"><a name="pos2465"></a>ADV FORD:   Was he actively involved in the activities of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2466"><a name="pos2466"></a>Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2467"><a name="pos2467"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2468"><a name="pos2468"></a>ADV FORD:   He was aware of all the different avenues open to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2469"><a name="pos2469"></a>Security Branch to keep people under observation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2470"><a name="pos2470"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2471"><a name="pos2471"></a>ADV FORD:   He was aware that phones were tapped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2472"><a name="pos2472"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   He should have known about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2473"><a name="pos2473"></a>ADV FORD:   He was aware that post was intercepted and was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2474"><a name="pos2474"></a>read?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2475"><a name="pos2475"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2476"><a name="pos2476"></a>ADV FORD:   He was aware that a big bag was opened at the post </p>
<p class="line" id="line2477"><a name="pos2477"></a>office, if your evidence is correct, where anything addressed to these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2478"><a name="pos2478"></a>specific addresses were thrown into and referred to the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line2479"><a name="pos2479"></a>Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2480"><a name="pos2480"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2481"><a name="pos2481"></a>ADV FORD:   Presumably Mr Mgoduka having been a member of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2482"><a name="pos2482"></a>Security Branch for that long, was not an absolute fool?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2483"><a name="pos2483"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2484"><a name="pos2484"></a>ADV FORD:   Are you suggesting that in those circumstances with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2485"><a name="pos2485"></a>that knowledge, he wrote letters to the Roma Church, he wrote </p>
<p class="line" id="line2486"><a name="pos2486"></a>letters to John Smith in London?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2487"><a name="pos2487"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2488"><a name="pos2488"></a>ADV FORD:   Where reference was made to funerals and to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2489"><a name="pos2489"></a>weddings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2490"><a name="pos2490"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, that is what I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2491"><a name="pos2491"></a>ADV FORD:   You don't have any copies of those letters I take it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2492"><a name="pos2492"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, all my reports from the first day on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2493"><a name="pos2493"></a>regarding this matter, I provided that to Gilbert.  And my post was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2494"><a name="pos2494"></a>also directed in the same manner, to him.  What he did with that, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2495"><a name="pos2495"></a>don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2496"><a name="pos2496"></a>ADV FORD:   Would you agree with me Mr Nieuwoudt, that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line2497"><a name="pos2497"></a>can be no doubt from what you have told this Commission now, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2498"><a name="pos2498"></a>Mr Mgoduka would have been aware that letters, these letters he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2499"><a name="pos2499"></a>addressed, were going to be intercepted by the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2500"><a name="pos2500"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   All letters are not intercepted.  Some of those </p>
<p class="line" id="line2501"><a name="pos2501"></a>letters would have gone to those addresses, just some were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2502"><a name="pos2502"></a>intercepted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2503"><a name="pos2503"></a>	And by using code names and not his own name, all those are </p>
<p class="line" id="line2504"><a name="pos2504"></a>factors must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2505"><a name="pos2505"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Did he use a code name or a foreign name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2506"><a name="pos2506"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, the address to which it was sent made use </p>
<p class="line" id="line2507"><a name="pos2507"></a>of a code name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2508"><a name="pos2508"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Yes, but who signed the letter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2509"><a name="pos2509"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was signed by a code name, he didn't write </p>
<p class="line" id="line2510"><a name="pos2510"></a>Glen Mgoduka, he used a code name.  I identified it on sight, his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2511"><a name="pos2511"></a>handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2512"><a name="pos2512"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   And you drew an inference that he was using </p>
<p class="line" id="line2513"><a name="pos2513"></a>the office typewriter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2514"><a name="pos2514"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I think he used his own typewriter which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2515"><a name="pos2515"></a>he had in his office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2516"><a name="pos2516"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2517"><a name="pos2517"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   But I also identified some of the letters on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2518"><a name="pos2518"></a>sight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2519"><a name="pos2519"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   So these are all inferences which you drew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2520"><a name="pos2520"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2521"><a name="pos2521"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   You are not a handwriting expert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2522"><a name="pos2522"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2523"><a name="pos2523"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   So you wouldn't be able to say whether it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2524"><a name="pos2524"></a>Mr Mgoduka's typewriter which had been used to type the letters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2525"><a name="pos2525"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, but I could see that there was a similarity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2526"><a name="pos2526"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Yes, but you couldn't say as a fact that it had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2527"><a name="pos2527"></a>been typed on that typewriter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2528"><a name="pos2528"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2529"><a name="pos2529"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But you relied on a hearsay allegation by an </p>
<p class="line" id="line2530"><a name="pos2530"></a>informer to the effect that Mr Mgoduka had been recruited by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2531"><a name="pos2531"></a>ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2532"><a name="pos2532"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2533"><a name="pos2533"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   That is all you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2534"><a name="pos2534"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2535"><a name="pos2535"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   And on the strength of that, you came to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2536"><a name="pos2536"></a>conclusion that had been recruited and he was working for the ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line2537"><a name="pos2537"></a>and that he should therefore be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2538"><a name="pos2538"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2539"><a name="pos2539"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Chairman, do you wish for me to continue, I see it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2540"><a name="pos2540"></a>is now quarter past one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2541"><a name="pos2541"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I think we will adjourn until two o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2542"><a name="pos2542"></a>COMMISSION ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2543"><a name="pos2543"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2544"><a name="pos2544"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Ford?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2545"><a name="pos2545"></a>GIDEON JOHANNES NIEUWOUDT:  (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2546"><a name="pos2546"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV FORD:	(cont)  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2547"><a name="pos2547"></a>	Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Nieuwoudt, there is an aspect of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2548"><a name="pos2548"></a>your application which is not clear to me and I would like you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2549"><a name="pos2549"></a>have a look at page 321 of your application, or 321 of the record, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2550"><a name="pos2550"></a>page 26 of your application.  Do you have it before you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2551"><a name="pos2551"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2552"><a name="pos2552"></a>ADV FORD:   And starting at the bottom paragraph 11, "during July </p>
<p class="line" id="line2553"><a name="pos2553"></a>of 1989 it came to my attention by the personnel and operators, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2554"><a name="pos2554"></a>there was a serious security leak in the information network at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2555"><a name="pos2555"></a>Security Branch and this leak led to sensitive information being </p>
<p class="line" id="line2556"><a name="pos2556"></a>exposed.  The exposure of this operation led to the death of a very </p>
<p class="line" id="line2557"><a name="pos2557"></a>sensitively placed informer and the intelligence capacity of the Unit, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2558"><a name="pos2558"></a>was detrimentally effected by the loss of this source."</p>
<p class="line" id="line2559"><a name="pos2559"></a>	And then you refer to annexure 15 as well as annexures 8, 9 </p>
<p class="line" id="line2560"><a name="pos2560"></a>and 25.  Now, if we can start with annexure 8.  Annexure 8 is an </p>
<p class="line" id="line2561"><a name="pos2561"></a>issue of Sishaba, dated May, 1986, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2562"><a name="pos2562"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Just a moment please.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2563"><a name="pos2563"></a>ADV FORD:   Page 412.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2564"><a name="pos2564"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Ford, excuse me, where are we now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2565"><a name="pos2565"></a>ADV FORD:   I am sorry Mr Chairman, it is page 412, annexure 8 of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2566"><a name="pos2566"></a>the application.  Maybe I could put the question to you Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2567"><a name="pos2567"></a>Nieuwoudt, this annexure was presumably referred to for a purpose. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2568"><a name="pos2568"></a> Where in that annexure does it refer to the sensitive operation </p>
<p class="line" id="line2569"><a name="pos2569"></a>which had been exposed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2570"><a name="pos2570"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I am going to interrupt you a little bit.  I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2571"><a name="pos2571"></a>like to appeal to those people who arrive late in the hearings, not to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2572"><a name="pos2572"></a>make a noise for those who are already listening, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2573"><a name="pos2573"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Could you please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2574"><a name="pos2574"></a>ADV FORD:   The issue of Sishaba you say it is, which is annexure </p>
<p class="line" id="line2575"><a name="pos2575"></a>8 at page 412, where if at all, does it refer to the sensitive operation </p>
<p class="line" id="line2576"><a name="pos2576"></a>which was uncovered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2577"><a name="pos2577"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   What I would like to indicate, if you look at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2578"><a name="pos2578"></a>page 5 of Sishaba, page 415 of the record, just underneath where it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2579"><a name="pos2579"></a>says forward freedom, we have seen them attacking the community </p>
<p class="line" id="line2580"><a name="pos2580"></a>councillors and the informers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2581"><a name="pos2581"></a>ADV FORD:   I see, so there is no reference at all to this specific </p>
<p class="line" id="line2582"><a name="pos2582"></a>incident that you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2583"><a name="pos2583"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2584"><a name="pos2584"></a>ADV FORD:   And similarly annexure 9 at page 419 ... </p>
<p class="line" id="line2585"><a name="pos2585"></a>(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2586"><a name="pos2586"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   If I may assist my learned friend, Mr Chairman, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2587"><a name="pos2587"></a>nowhere in the annexures does it refer to the specific one.  I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2588"><a name="pos2588"></a>checked that as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2589"><a name="pos2589"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, then perhaps, Mr Nieuwoudt you can explain </p>
<p class="line" id="line2590"><a name="pos2590"></a>what the reason for annexing them, was?  They appear to have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line2591"><a name="pos2591"></a>annexed with specific reference to this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2592"><a name="pos2592"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, what it deals with is the death of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2593"><a name="pos2593"></a>informers and as I have already explained, the unrest and riots which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2594"><a name="pos2594"></a>had been and the establishment of underground structures, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2595"><a name="pos2595"></a>mobilisation and the politicisation of the masses and the people's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2596"><a name="pos2596"></a>war which eventually took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2597"><a name="pos2597"></a>ADV FORD:   I see, so none of these annexures are of any </p>
<p class="line" id="line2598"><a name="pos2598"></a>assistance in identifying the leak which occurred in the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line2599"><a name="pos2599"></a>Branch neither are they of any assistance in dealing with the issue of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2600"><a name="pos2600"></a>whether Mgoduka was involved at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2601"><a name="pos2601"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2602"><a name="pos2602"></a>ADV FORD:   Then I will ask you to turn to page 323, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2603"><a name="pos2603"></a>Nieuwoudt, and to the second portion of paragraph 13.  "It was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2604"><a name="pos2604"></a>clear that it was Warrant Officer Mgoduka or it had to have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line2605"><a name="pos2605"></a>Warrant Officer Mgoduka", and I emphasise had to have been.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line2606"><a name="pos2606"></a>are not referring to a suspicion, you are referring to a certainty.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line2607"><a name="pos2607"></a>was clear that it must have been him, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2608"><a name="pos2608"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2609"><a name="pos2609"></a>ADV FORD:   Why was it so clear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2610"><a name="pos2610"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Because it was only the two of us who had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2611"><a name="pos2611"></a>knowledge of that operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2612"><a name="pos2612"></a>ADV FORD:   Was there not a possibility that this source could </p>
<p class="line" id="line2613"><a name="pos2613"></a>have made a slip up of his own in his undercover position and could </p>
<p class="line" id="line2614"><a name="pos2614"></a>have been identified for other reasons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2615"><a name="pos2615"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is possible, but I had applied the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2616"><a name="pos2616"></a>necessary security measures.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2617"><a name="pos2617"></a>ADV FORD:   No, no, no, that is a general term which is not going </p>
<p class="line" id="line2618"><a name="pos2618"></a>to assist you, what does that mean Mr Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2619"><a name="pos2619"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I applied the necessary security measures and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2620"><a name="pos2620"></a>was certain that it didn't come from my side.  I believed that it came </p>
<p class="line" id="line2621"><a name="pos2621"></a>from Mgoduka's side, that is what I believed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2622"><a name="pos2622"></a>ADV FORD:   Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2623"><a name="pos2623"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Because that source had been eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2624"><a name="pos2624"></a>ADV FORD:   But then I return to my question, why couldn't it have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2625"><a name="pos2625"></a>been possible that he made his own slip up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2626"><a name="pos2626"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is possible, one can't exclude that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2627"><a name="pos2627"></a>possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2628"><a name="pos2628"></a>ADV FORD:   Why then did you say that it was clear that it must </p>
<p class="line" id="line2629"><a name="pos2629"></a>have been Warrant Officer Mgoduka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2630"><a name="pos2630"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I repeat, I believed that I had applied all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2631"><a name="pos2631"></a>necessary security measures in dealing with an informer and I was of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2632"><a name="pos2632"></a>the view and believed, that that was the position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2633"><a name="pos2633"></a>ADV FORD:   And this was the starting point which led to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2634"><a name="pos2634"></a>execution of Mr Mgoduka at a later stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2635"><a name="pos2635"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, yes, that was the prior events.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2636"><a name="pos2636"></a>ADV FORD:   On the following page Mr Nieuwoudt, you say in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2637"><a name="pos2637"></a>light of this, I was uncertain whether he could have been the source </p>
<p class="line" id="line2638"><a name="pos2638"></a>of this leak.  It was however, noticeable that during the riot period, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2639"><a name="pos2639"></a>his home was never attacked, even though he lived amongst his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2640"><a name="pos2640"></a>colleagues who did indeed suffer during these attacks.  The vehicle </p>
<p class="line" id="line2641"><a name="pos2641"></a>which he drove, was also not attacked.  Where did he live Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2642"><a name="pos2642"></a>Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2643"><a name="pos2643"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   In Mabiza Street, New Brighton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2644"><a name="pos2644"></a>ADV FORD:   Are you certain of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2645"><a name="pos2645"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2646"><a name="pos2646"></a>ADV FORD:   My instructions are that he lived in KwaMagxaki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2647"><a name="pos2647"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was only at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2648"><a name="pos2648"></a>ADV FORD:   When was that Mr Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2649"><a name="pos2649"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   After KwaMagxaki had been developed, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2650"><a name="pos2650"></a>then bought the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2651"><a name="pos2651"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, that seems to follow, I am asking you when that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2652"><a name="pos2652"></a>was Mr Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2653"><a name="pos2653"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I can't give you an exact date, but it was only </p>
<p class="line" id="line2654"><a name="pos2654"></a>at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2655"><a name="pos2655"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, what you are saying is that - let me ask you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2656"><a name="pos2656"></a>this, how long had he been living in KwaMagxaki?  Can you tell us </p>
<p class="line" id="line2657"><a name="pos2657"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2658"><a name="pos2658"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was probably from 1987 onwards, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2659"><a name="pos2659"></a>am not entirely certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2660"><a name="pos2660"></a>ADV FORD:   So for a period of at least one and a half years, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2661"><a name="pos2661"></a>had been living in KwaMagxaki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2662"><a name="pos2662"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2663"><a name="pos2663"></a>ADV FORD:   KwaMagxaki was a reasonably upper class area?  Is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2664"><a name="pos2664"></a>that a fair statement to make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2665"><a name="pos2665"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2666"><a name="pos2666"></a>ADV FORD:   And a number of policemen lived there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2667"><a name="pos2667"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2668"><a name="pos2668"></a>ADV FORD:   None of them had any problems in so far as attacks of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2669"><a name="pos2669"></a>their houses were concerned, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2670"><a name="pos2670"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2671"><a name="pos2671"></a>ADV FORD:   And the real suspicion about Mr Mgoduka, the first </p>
<p class="line" id="line2672"><a name="pos2672"></a>indication occurred in July 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2673"><a name="pos2673"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2674"><a name="pos2674"></a>ADV FORD:   And you had no indication that before that he was in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2675"><a name="pos2675"></a>any way putting out feelers or in any way involved with conveying </p>
<p class="line" id="line2676"><a name="pos2676"></a>information to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2677"><a name="pos2677"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2678"><a name="pos2678"></a>ADV FORD:   Well then why would the absence of attacks on his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2679"><a name="pos2679"></a>house in that period, when there were no attacks on other policemen </p>
<p class="line" id="line2680"><a name="pos2680"></a>in the area, have played any role whatsoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2681"><a name="pos2681"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, because before the development of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2682"><a name="pos2682"></a>KwaMagxaki the other Security Police homes had been attacked, his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2683"><a name="pos2683"></a>home was never attacked.  And that was strange and I can remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line2684"><a name="pos2684"></a>that before that he had lived next door to an ANC activist who had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2685"><a name="pos2685"></a>been involved in the recruitment of people and distribution of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2686"><a name="pos2686"></a>pamphlets, it was quite some time earlier, and he didn't give us that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2687"><a name="pos2687"></a>information when he was in Mabiza Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2688"><a name="pos2688"></a>ADV FORD:   And when did you find that out Mr Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2689"><a name="pos2689"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was early in the 1980's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2690"><a name="pos2690"></a>ADV FORD:   I am sorry, when you found it out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2691"><a name="pos2691"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   When it came to our notice, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2692"><a name="pos2692"></a>ADV FORD:   So are you saying that long before 1989, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2693"><a name="pos2693"></a>suspected Mr Mgoduka's loyalty or you questioned it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2694"><a name="pos2694"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, it didn't arise with me.  We must take into </p>
<p class="line" id="line2695"><a name="pos2695"></a>account that some of my sources had been eliminated much earlier, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2696"><a name="pos2696"></a>which he had been involved, so it all gave rise and contributed to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2697"><a name="pos2697"></a>final phase in which there was recruitment and so forth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2698"><a name="pos2698"></a>ADV FORD:   I see.  Mr Nieuwoudt, you then carry on in paragraph </p>
<p class="line" id="line2699"><a name="pos2699"></a>14 about your discussion which you then immediately went to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2700"><a name="pos2700"></a>discuss the matter with Brigadier Gilbert and you say the fear </p>
<p class="line" id="line2701"><a name="pos2701"></a>existed that other undercover operations as well as safe houses and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2702"><a name="pos2702"></a>premises would be exposed.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2703"><a name="pos2703"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2704"><a name="pos2704"></a>ADV FORD:   Now, the Intelligence Unit of which you were the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2705"><a name="pos2705"></a>Commander, had only been on the go for a month at that stage, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2706"><a name="pos2706"></a>that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2707"><a name="pos2707"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2708"><a name="pos2708"></a>ADV FORD:   Presumably you hadn't developed any real number of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2709"><a name="pos2709"></a>safe houses and what do you refer to them as facilities with respect </p>
<p class="line" id="line2710"><a name="pos2710"></a>to your specific Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2711"><a name="pos2711"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, but the Unit had already </p>
<p class="line" id="line2712"><a name="pos2712"></a>existed in 1988.  I further developed it and got it off the ground.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2713"><a name="pos2713"></a>Captain Van Vuuren had told me that there were safe premises </p>
<p class="line" id="line2714"><a name="pos2714"></a>available at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2715"><a name="pos2715"></a>ADV FORD:   Now, when we refer to a safe premises, I presume </p>
<p class="line" id="line2716"><a name="pos2716"></a>you refer to no more than a house which is presumably rented with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2717"><a name="pos2717"></a>no reference to the police, there is no involvement of the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line2718"><a name="pos2718"></a>Branch in so far as the public are aware in relation to that house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2719"><a name="pos2719"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2720"><a name="pos2720"></a>ADV FORD:   So to replace a safe house, is really no more than </p>
<p class="line" id="line2721"><a name="pos2721"></a>terminating that rental and finding another one, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2722"><a name="pos2722"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2723"><a name="pos2723"></a>ADV FORD:   And presumably your Unit would have been interested </p>
<p class="line" id="line2724"><a name="pos2724"></a>in setting up and maintaining your own safe houses, unrelated to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2725"><a name="pos2725"></a>other Security Branch safe houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2726"><a name="pos2726"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, they formed part of my Unit.  So I used </p>
<p class="line" id="line2727"><a name="pos2727"></a>their facilities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2728"><a name="pos2728"></a>ADV FORD:   I am sorry, what formed part of your Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2729"><a name="pos2729"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Captain Van Vuuren who already at that stage </p>
<p class="line" id="line2730"><a name="pos2730"></a>had a safe house, formed part of my Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2731"><a name="pos2731"></a>ADV FORD:   But was there any reason why your Unit could not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2732"><a name="pos2732"></a>establish its own safe houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2733"><a name="pos2733"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, but there were cost </p>
<p class="line" id="line2734"><a name="pos2734"></a>implications and contracts to be drafted and there were many other </p>
<p class="line" id="line2735"><a name="pos2735"></a>factors to be taken into consideration, needed authorization from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2736"><a name="pos2736"></a>head office, and all those things had to be considered, it wasn't such </p>
<p class="line" id="line2737"><a name="pos2737"></a>a simple matter of just going out and finding a house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2738"><a name="pos2738"></a>ADV FORD:   You are not suggesting that these four men were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2739"><a name="pos2739"></a>killed just because it was a matter of spending a bit more money and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2740"><a name="pos2740"></a>a bit more red tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2741"><a name="pos2741"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2742"><a name="pos2742"></a>ADV FORD:   And the operating premises that you refer to later, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2743"><a name="pos2743"></a>what precisely did that entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2744"><a name="pos2744"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Those were also premises where all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2745"><a name="pos2745"></a>operatives and the handlers performed their administrative duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2746"><a name="pos2746"></a>ADV FORD:   Once again, a bit of money, a bit of arrangement, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2747"><a name="pos2747"></a>could have organised a new operating premises without too much </p>
<p class="line" id="line2748"><a name="pos2748"></a>problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2749"><a name="pos2749"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, but there was a lot more to it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2750"><a name="pos2750"></a>than that.  It wasn't such a simple matter and you had to motivate it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2751"><a name="pos2751"></a>properly and head office would have to consider the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2752"><a name="pos2752"></a>ADV FORD:   We are talking about a calculated decision to kill four </p>
<p class="line" id="line2753"><a name="pos2753"></a>people Mr Nieuwoudt, as opposed to the proportionality, as opposed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2754"><a name="pos2754"></a>to a little bit of inconvenience and a little bit of cost of changing </p>
<p class="line" id="line2755"><a name="pos2755"></a>your houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2756"><a name="pos2756"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I didn't make the decision to eliminate them.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2757"><a name="pos2757"></a>It was Brigadier Gilbert.  Whether he considered those factors, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2758"><a name="pos2758"></a>don't know.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2759"><a name="pos2759"></a>ADV FORD:   But we know, because you have told us, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line2760"><a name="pos2760"></a>Brigadier Gilbert's immediate reaction was, transfer them.  He didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2761"><a name="pos2761"></a>want to kill them.  You pushed him into that, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2762"><a name="pos2762"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2763"><a name="pos2763"></a>ADV FORD:   By repeated returns to Brigadier Gilbert and which is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2764"><a name="pos2764"></a>apparent from your application, you pushed him into that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2765"><a name="pos2765"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.  I couldn't give him orders.  It is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2766"><a name="pos2766"></a>unacceptable, I don't agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2767"><a name="pos2767"></a>ADV FORD:   Well ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2768"><a name="pos2768"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, it is not suggested that you gave him </p>
<p class="line" id="line2769"><a name="pos2769"></a>orders.  I think what is being put to you is that you impressed on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2770"><a name="pos2770"></a>him the fact that these people should be eliminated, in other words, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2771"><a name="pos2771"></a>you were not quite happy with the transfer?  You impressed on him </p>
<p class="line" id="line2772"><a name="pos2772"></a>that the best thing would be to eliminate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2773"><a name="pos2773"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I only made a suggestion to him.  I didn't place </p>
<p class="line" id="line2774"><a name="pos2774"></a>any pressure on him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2775"><a name="pos2775"></a>ADV FORD:   So the suggestion that they should be killed, came </p>
<p class="line" id="line2776"><a name="pos2776"></a>from you Mr Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2777"><a name="pos2777"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2778"><a name="pos2778"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, what suggestion did you make then Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2779"><a name="pos2779"></a>Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2780"><a name="pos2780"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   What I said, I told him what the implications </p>
<p class="line" id="line2781"><a name="pos2781"></a>were as I saw it and it wouldn't help to transfer them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2782"><a name="pos2782"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, Mr Nieuwoudt, I want to take you to page 327 </p>
<p class="line" id="line2783"><a name="pos2783"></a>of your application, paragraph 21, where you say Brigadier Gilbert's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2784"><a name="pos2784"></a>spontaneous reaction was that these people should immediately be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2785"><a name="pos2785"></a>transferred from the Security Branch and that he was prepared to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2786"><a name="pos2786"></a>immediately make the necessary arrangements with head quarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2787"><a name="pos2787"></a>	This was after listened to their talk in the tea room as you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2788"><a name="pos2788"></a>have alleged, this was after you had been monitoring them, this was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2789"><a name="pos2789"></a>after you had intercepted Mr Mgoduka's post.  Brigadier Gilbert still </p>
<p class="line" id="line2790"><a name="pos2790"></a>thinks that an appropriate procedure is to transfer them.  The idea </p>
<p class="line" id="line2791"><a name="pos2791"></a>was that these people would be transferred to a centre outside of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2792"><a name="pos2792"></a>Eastern Cape to prevent any further damage being done to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2793"><a name="pos2793"></a>information network.  And then you go on Mr Nieuwoudt, however, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2794"><a name="pos2794"></a>I focused Gilbert's attention on the fact that this matter was a lot </p>
<p class="line" id="line2795"><a name="pos2795"></a>more complicated and sensitive since these particular members had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2796"><a name="pos2796"></a>been attached to the Security Branch for quite some time.   What are </p>
<p class="line" id="line2797"><a name="pos2797"></a>you trying to tell us there, Mr Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2798"><a name="pos2798"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Mr Gilbert didn't know the members, and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2799"><a name="pos2799"></a>didn't know the circumstances.  And I simply explained the issues to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2800"><a name="pos2800"></a>him.  That is what I mean.  I drew his attention to that fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2801"><a name="pos2801"></a>ADV FORD:   Are you suggesting Brigadier Gilbert didn't know the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2802"><a name="pos2802"></a>persons under his command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2803"><a name="pos2803"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is not what I am saying here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2804"><a name="pos2804"></a>ADV FORD:   Or how long they had been with the command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2805"><a name="pos2805"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I believed that he knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2806"><a name="pos2806"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Nieuwoudt, was this anything other than an </p>
<p class="line" id="line2807"><a name="pos2807"></a>attempt to convince Brigadier Gilbert that the only way here was to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2808"><a name="pos2808"></a>kill these persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2809"><a name="pos2809"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2810"><a name="pos2810"></a>ADV FORD:   Maybe you didn't understand my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2811"><a name="pos2811"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   What did you have in mind?  What I brought to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2812"><a name="pos2812"></a>Gilbert's attention was that transferring would not be a solution, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2813"><a name="pos2813"></a>because they could escape and then all the information which they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2814"><a name="pos2814"></a>possessed, they would be free to convey it to the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2815"><a name="pos2815"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   You did not agree with them being transferred, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2816"><a name="pos2816"></a>so what did you have in mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2817"><a name="pos2817"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   At that stage I didn't have anything in mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2818"><a name="pos2818"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Would you have been satisfied with a transfer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2819"><a name="pos2819"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   If that is what he decided, I would have, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2820"><a name="pos2820"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   And you would have accepted it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2821"><a name="pos2821"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2822"><a name="pos2822"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   And you wouldn't have had further problems </p>
<p class="line" id="line2823"><a name="pos2823"></a>with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2824"><a name="pos2824"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   The only problem which I would have foreseen </p>
<p class="line" id="line2825"><a name="pos2825"></a>would be that they could defect to the ANC and endanger our </p>
<p class="line" id="line2826"><a name="pos2826"></a>security network by exposing information and that they could </p>
<p class="line" id="line2827"><a name="pos2827"></a>identify informers and policemen, etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2828"><a name="pos2828"></a>	That is what I had in mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2829"><a name="pos2829"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   So those are all the possibilities that existed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2830"><a name="pos2830"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2831"><a name="pos2831"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But if the idea was that they should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2832"><a name="pos2832"></a>transferred, you would accepted that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2833"><a name="pos2833"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   If that was his order, that is how I would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2834"><a name="pos2834"></a>accepted it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2835"><a name="pos2835"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   So one could have solved the problem by </p>
<p class="line" id="line2836"><a name="pos2836"></a>means of transfer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2837"><a name="pos2837"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I don't know.  I couldn't make that decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2838"><a name="pos2838"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Mr Nieuwoudt, if I am transferred and I have the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2839"><a name="pos2839"></a>names of four informers, and I go to the ANC and I give them those </p>
<p class="line" id="line2840"><a name="pos2840"></a>four names, what would happen them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2841"><a name="pos2841"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   In my view, they would have been eliminated </p>
<p class="line" id="line2842"><a name="pos2842"></a>and our intelligence network would be prejudiced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2843"><a name="pos2843"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   So the only solution was you had to either put </p>
<p class="line" id="line2844"><a name="pos2844"></a>them in a prison where they weren't able to convey the information </p>
<p class="line" id="line2845"><a name="pos2845"></a>and weren't able to defect to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2846"><a name="pos2846"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2847"><a name="pos2847"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Now, why was that not a solution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2848"><a name="pos2848"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Because according to knowledge that I had, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2849"><a name="pos2849"></a>some people had already leaked information by means of visitors </p>
<p class="line" id="line2850"><a name="pos2850"></a>which they had received in prison, so there are many ways in which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2851"><a name="pos2851"></a>the information could be passed on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2852"><a name="pos2852"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Nieuwoudt, while we are on that, you referred in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2853"><a name="pos2853"></a>your evidence to Section 29 of the Internal Security Act, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2854"><a name="pos2854"></a>right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2855"><a name="pos2855"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2856"><a name="pos2856"></a>ADV FORD:   Your powers went a little bit further than that at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2857"><a name="pos2857"></a>stage, didn't they?  There were certain Security Emergency </p>
<p class="line" id="line2858"><a name="pos2858"></a>Regulations in place, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2859"><a name="pos2859"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2860"><a name="pos2860"></a>ADV FORD:   And we all know about Section 3 of those Emergency </p>
<p class="line" id="line2861"><a name="pos2861"></a>Regulations, arrest and detention of persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2862"><a name="pos2862"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2863"><a name="pos2863"></a>ADV FORD:   We all know of the prohibition on visits?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2864"><a name="pos2864"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Not under the Emergency Regulations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2865"><a name="pos2865"></a>ADV FORD:   You are not aware of that?  Are you suggesting that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2866"><a name="pos2866"></a>people detained under the Emergency Regulations, could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2867"><a name="pos2867"></a>visitors at will?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2868"><a name="pos2868"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2869"><a name="pos2869"></a>ADV FORD:   And they could have access to their legal </p>
<p class="line" id="line2870"><a name="pos2870"></a>representatives at will?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2871"><a name="pos2871"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2872"><a name="pos2872"></a>ADV FORD:   I see.  We will come back to that Mr Nieuwoudt.  If I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2873"><a name="pos2873"></a>could then deal with the next sentence in this paragraph I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2874"><a name="pos2874"></a>dealing with at 328.  "The matter was further complicated by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2875"><a name="pos2875"></a>fact that these members possibly had knowledge of covert offensive </p>
<p class="line" id="line2876"><a name="pos2876"></a>and defensive operations and could exert a certain influence on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2877"><a name="pos2877"></a>other black members at the Security Branch?  That sound to me Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2878"><a name="pos2878"></a>Nieuwoudt, like you didn't really know whether they had, you simply </p>
<p class="line" id="line2879"><a name="pos2879"></a>speak of possibly had knowledge, you weren't really certain of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2880"><a name="pos2880"></a>whether these people had information in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2881"><a name="pos2881"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   All I knew at that stage about the covert </p>
<p class="line" id="line2882"><a name="pos2882"></a>operations in which he had been involved, was the Swaziland one </p>
<p class="line" id="line2883"><a name="pos2883"></a>and the Lesotho one, where he had been involved.  Where all four of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2884"><a name="pos2884"></a>them had been involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2885"><a name="pos2885"></a>ADV FORD:   What did you mean by to exert a specific influence on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2886"><a name="pos2886"></a>the black members, what did you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2887"><a name="pos2887"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is what I said at the outset, that if he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2888"><a name="pos2888"></a>defected or exposed information and structures, then they would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2889"><a name="pos2889"></a>able to compile a proper profile of the members in the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line2890"><a name="pos2890"></a>Branch.  And that could be severely prejudicial, that was my view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2891"><a name="pos2891"></a>ADV FORD:   You are not talking about them trying to exercise </p>
<p class="line" id="line2892"><a name="pos2892"></a>some influence amongst their colleagues by trying to turn their </p>
<p class="line" id="line2893"><a name="pos2893"></a>colleagues as well within the Security Branch, you are not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2894"><a name="pos2894"></a>suggesting that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2895"><a name="pos2895"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I was more concerned about the damage to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2896"><a name="pos2896"></a>the Intelligence network and threat to informers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2897"><a name="pos2897"></a>ADV FORD:   Now at what stage did this take place, your second </p>
<p class="line" id="line2898"><a name="pos2898"></a>visit to Brigadier Gilbert, how much longer?  A month later, two </p>
<p class="line" id="line2899"><a name="pos2899"></a>months later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2900"><a name="pos2900"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I don't have an independent recollection, but it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2901"><a name="pos2901"></a>could have been a month before that, before December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2902"><a name="pos2902"></a>ADV FORD:   So from July 1989 through to shall we say November </p>
<p class="line" id="line2903"><a name="pos2903"></a>or early November or end of October 1989, Mgoduka and the others </p>
<p class="line" id="line2904"><a name="pos2904"></a>were allowed to continue as normal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2905"><a name="pos2905"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2906"><a name="pos2906"></a>ADV FORD:   There was no attempt to limit their involvement with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2907"><a name="pos2907"></a>Security Force activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2908"><a name="pos2908"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2909"><a name="pos2909"></a>ADV FORD:   No attempt to keep them away from safe houses and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2910"><a name="pos2910"></a>other such premises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2911"><a name="pos2911"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2912"><a name="pos2912"></a>ADV FORD:   Presumably the development of your Information </p>
<p class="line" id="line2913"><a name="pos2913"></a>Network and the recruiting of informers, is an ongoing thing.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2914"><a name="pos2914"></a>People are being recruited all the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2915"><a name="pos2915"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2916"><a name="pos2916"></a>ADV FORD:   There was no attempt made to prevent them from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2917"><a name="pos2917"></a>acquiring knowledge relating to the identity of any new informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2918"><a name="pos2918"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2919"><a name="pos2919"></a>ADV FORD:   Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2920"><a name="pos2920"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2921"><a name="pos2921"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, didn't you think it important to try and limit the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2922"><a name="pos2922"></a>damage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2923"><a name="pos2923"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, they weren't under my command at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2924"><a name="pos2924"></a>stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2925"><a name="pos2925"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, under who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2926"><a name="pos2926"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   They were under the, or some of them were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2927"><a name="pos2927"></a>under the Investigation team and some of them under the command </p>
<p class="line" id="line2928"><a name="pos2928"></a>of the Black Affairs Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2929"><a name="pos2929"></a>ADV FORD:   Mgoduka was under Roelofse, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2930"><a name="pos2930"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2931"><a name="pos2931"></a>ADV FORD:   Who was under Colonel Roelofse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2932"><a name="pos2932"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Mapipa and Faku.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2933"><a name="pos2933"></a>ADV FORD:   And who was Mgoduka's senior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2934"><a name="pos2934"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Colonel Scheepers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2935"><a name="pos2935"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you go and speak to these senior officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2936"><a name="pos2936"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2937"><a name="pos2937"></a>ADV FORD:   To tell them of your suspicions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2938"><a name="pos2938"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2939"><a name="pos2939"></a>ADV FORD:   Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2940"><a name="pos2940"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I have already said, my Unit reported </p>
<p class="line" id="line2941"><a name="pos2941"></a>directly to Brigadier Gilbert.  If he thought it was necessary, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2942"><a name="pos2942"></a>could have done it, I didn't know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2943"><a name="pos2943"></a>ADV FORD:   Now, your next attempt if we understand your </p>
<p class="line" id="line2944"><a name="pos2944"></a>application and your evidence, was that you were going to - I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line2945"><a name="pos2945"></a>reading page 329, paragraph 24, the purpose was that I would on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2946"><a name="pos2946"></a>gradual basis by means of discussions with these four people, would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2947"><a name="pos2947"></a>communicate and try and illicit information from them about these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2948"><a name="pos2948"></a>activities in order to determine the graveness of the risk.  Now </p>
<p class="line" id="line2949"><a name="pos2949"></a>precisely what chance, as subtle as you may have been Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2950"><a name="pos2950"></a>Nieuwoudt, did you think there was of you getting these people to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2951"><a name="pos2951"></a>reveal their involvement with the ANC to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2952"><a name="pos2952"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was an attempt which I made to have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2953"><a name="pos2953"></a>discussions with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2954"><a name="pos2954"></a>ADV FORD:   I understand that, you have told us that.  I am asking </p>
<p class="line" id="line2955"><a name="pos2955"></a>you what possible prospect did you foresee of getting them to talk </p>
<p class="line" id="line2956"><a name="pos2956"></a>to you about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2957"><a name="pos2957"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I thought they possibly trusted me enough </p>
<p class="line" id="line2958"><a name="pos2958"></a>because at that stage we had never had any arguments or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2959"><a name="pos2959"></a>altercations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2960"><a name="pos2960"></a>ADV FORD:   You thought at this stage where there already had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2961"><a name="pos2961"></a>been letters written to the ANC, there had been these talks about </p>
<p class="line" id="line2962"><a name="pos2962"></a>feelers being put out, there had been talks about going over to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2963"><a name="pos2963"></a>ANC, you thought they were going to say to you Mr Nieuwoudt, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2964"><a name="pos2964"></a>actually think of going over to the ANC, what do you think about </p>
<p class="line" id="line2965"><a name="pos2965"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2966"><a name="pos2966"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I don't think they would have said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2967"><a name="pos2967"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, what did you expect from them Mr Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2968"><a name="pos2968"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is what I thought at that stage.  I thought </p>
<p class="line" id="line2969"><a name="pos2969"></a>they would perhaps let slip some bit of information which would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2970"><a name="pos2970"></a>give me some clue, make sense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2971"><a name="pos2971"></a>ADV FORD:   Now, you then go on to deal with the Lesotho, where </p>
<p class="line" id="line2972"><a name="pos2972"></a>one of your informants, it appears, advised that the ANC was fully </p>
<p class="line" id="line2973"><a name="pos2973"></a>aware of the location of our specific facilities and that the issue of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2974"><a name="pos2974"></a>infiltration had been exposed.  Now, if I understand your evidence, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2975"><a name="pos2975"></a>you escribed that to Mgoduka and or the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2976"><a name="pos2976"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2977"><a name="pos2977"></a>ADV FORD:   So it was quite clear to you then that a significant </p>
<p class="line" id="line2978"><a name="pos2978"></a>amount of information had already been conveyed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2979"><a name="pos2979"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2980"><a name="pos2980"></a>ADV FORD:   You had no way of knowing how much information </p>
<p class="line" id="line2981"><a name="pos2981"></a>had been conveyed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2982"><a name="pos2982"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, but as I have already said I did not believe </p>
<p class="line" id="line2983"><a name="pos2983"></a>that they had passed on all the information that was at their </p>
<p class="line" id="line2984"><a name="pos2984"></a>disposal, to the ANC, but the knowledge they had of this specific </p>
<p class="line" id="line2985"><a name="pos2985"></a>operation, they did pass on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2986"><a name="pos2986"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, what led you to that belief?  What possible </p>
<p class="line" id="line2987"><a name="pos2987"></a>reason did you have for believing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2988"><a name="pos2988"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I thought that all four of them were involved, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2989"><a name="pos2989"></a>and the next day a person was arrested in Swaziland and I didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2990"><a name="pos2990"></a>hear anything from them.  I later found out after they came back, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2991"><a name="pos2991"></a>that they had been in Quatro.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2992"><a name="pos2992"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Nieuwoudt, you are not answering my question.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2993"><a name="pos2993"></a>am asking you what led you to believe that they hadn't disclosed all </p>
<p class="line" id="line2994"><a name="pos2994"></a>the information available to them, to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2995"><a name="pos2995"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I have explained there is a lot of other </p>
<p class="line" id="line2996"><a name="pos2996"></a>information, it would have taken quite some time to debrief them </p>
<p class="line" id="line2997"><a name="pos2997"></a>and to extract the information from them, so they would have had to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2998"><a name="pos2998"></a>be physically present at the ANC to give them all the information </p>
<p class="line" id="line2999"><a name="pos2999"></a>and that is why I believed that they didn't pass on all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3000"><a name="pos3000"></a>information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3001"><a name="pos3001"></a>ADV FORD:   So you are saying that they had probably given over </p>
<p class="line" id="line3002"><a name="pos3002"></a>everything which they knew on an off the cuff basis, but a trained </p>
<p class="line" id="line3003"><a name="pos3003"></a>interrogated could have gotten more out of them, is that what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3004"><a name="pos3004"></a>are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3005"><a name="pos3005"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3006"><a name="pos3006"></a>ADV FORD:   Were the Security Police in the habit of allowing </p>
<p class="line" id="line3007"><a name="pos3007"></a>trained ANC interrogators into places of detention to interrogate </p>
<p class="line" id="line3008"><a name="pos3008"></a>detainees?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3009"><a name="pos3009"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3010"><a name="pos3010"></a>ADV FORD:   So what possible chance was there then of any </p>
<p class="line" id="line3011"><a name="pos3011"></a>interrogation taking place if they had been detained in terms of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3012"><a name="pos3012"></a>Security Regulations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3013"><a name="pos3013"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I said the could still send messages </p>
<p class="line" id="line3014"><a name="pos3014"></a>through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3015"><a name="pos3015"></a>ADV FORD:   No Mr Nieuwoudt, your reasoning behind why they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3016"><a name="pos3016"></a>should not have been transferred and why they should not have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line3017"><a name="pos3017"></a>detained, as I understood it, was that - or why they shouldn't have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3018"><a name="pos3018"></a>been transferred is that if they then walked over or went over to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3019"><a name="pos3019"></a>ANC, they could end up in the hands of a trained interrogator and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3020"><a name="pos3020"></a>further information could be gathered from them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3021"><a name="pos3021"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3022"><a name="pos3022"></a>ADV FORD:   Other than for that, you had no reason to suspect that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3023"><a name="pos3023"></a>they hadn't given the ANC all the information that they had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3024"><a name="pos3024"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I have understood it, they had to have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line3025"><a name="pos3025"></a>on the ANC's side and somebody would then have had to debrief </p>
<p class="line" id="line3026"><a name="pos3026"></a>them over a couple of days to extract the information from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3027"><a name="pos3027"></a>ADV FORD:   But you could have stopped that immediately.  At the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3028"><a name="pos3028"></a>drop of a hat by detaining them in terms of Section 3 of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3029"><a name="pos3029"></a>Emergency Regulations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3030"><a name="pos3030"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I couldn't, because then they would still pass </p>
<p class="line" id="line3031"><a name="pos3031"></a>on some of the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3032"><a name="pos3032"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Nieuwoudt, you are evading the question.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line3033"><a name="pos3033"></a>had no reason to suspect that they had not conveyed all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3034"><a name="pos3034"></a>information available to them, save for that which would be obtained </p>
<p class="line" id="line3035"><a name="pos3035"></a>by a trained interrogator, that is what we are talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3036"><a name="pos3036"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is what I believed at that stage.  That is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3037"><a name="pos3037"></a>how I saw it and that is what I believed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3038"><a name="pos3038"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, then what possible further harm could they have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3039"><a name="pos3039"></a>done to anybody if they had been detained in terms of the Emergency </p>
<p class="line" id="line3040"><a name="pos3040"></a>Regulations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3041"><a name="pos3041"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   They could give further information because </p>
<p class="line" id="line3042"><a name="pos3042"></a>what we are dealing with is the total concept with the Intelligence </p>
<p class="line" id="line3043"><a name="pos3043"></a>Network.  So there were other informers and Security members and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3044"><a name="pos3044"></a>policemen whose lives could have been in danger.  And their </p>
<p class="line" id="line3045"><a name="pos3045"></a>profiles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3046"><a name="pos3046"></a>ADV FORD:   But Mr Nieuwoudt, you already know that they have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3047"><a name="pos3047"></a>disclosed at least one safe house, you already know that they have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3048"><a name="pos3048"></a>disclosed at least one informer, why do you think they hadn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line3049"><a name="pos3049"></a>disclosed all the rest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3050"><a name="pos3050"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I have said I believed that they could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3051"><a name="pos3051"></a>given more information because they could have damaged the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3052"><a name="pos3052"></a>network pertaining to the other members of the Security Branch, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3053"><a name="pos3053"></a>perhaps they could have identified more members of the Branch and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3054"><a name="pos3054"></a>other informers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3055"><a name="pos3055"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   I think the question is they had given </p>
<p class="line" id="line3056"><a name="pos3056"></a>information.  On what basis did you assume or accept that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3057"><a name="pos3057"></a>hadn't already given all the information which they possessed?  Why </p>
<p class="line" id="line3058"><a name="pos3058"></a>do you think they were holding something back which they would </p>
<p class="line" id="line3059"><a name="pos3059"></a>have given at a later stage and perhaps would have been able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3060"><a name="pos3060"></a>smuggle from jail where they were not being debriefed?  If they had </p>
<p class="line" id="line3061"><a name="pos3061"></a>already passed on anything which they could without being debriefed </p>
<p class="line" id="line3062"><a name="pos3062"></a>by an expert, and in prison there would be no expert to debrief them, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3063"><a name="pos3063"></a>so there could be no further passing on of information.  If you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3064"><a name="pos3064"></a>perhaps understand it like that, I think that is what the Advocate is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3065"><a name="pos3065"></a>trying to put to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3066"><a name="pos3066"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is so, but as I understood it at that stage, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3067"><a name="pos3067"></a>there was no guarantee to ensure that the information could not be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3068"><a name="pos3068"></a>leaked and ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3069"><a name="pos3069"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   I understand that there was no guarantee that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3070"><a name="pos3070"></a>information could not be leaked, but you are saying that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3071"><a name="pos3071"></a>believed that they had already conveyed all the information which </p>
<p class="line" id="line3072"><a name="pos3072"></a>they had, so then the horse was already bolted and there was nothing </p>
<p class="line" id="line3073"><a name="pos3073"></a>more that they could do to cause damage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3074"><a name="pos3074"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I have said, I did not believe that all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3075"><a name="pos3075"></a>information had been conveyed, that is what I am saying.  I didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line3076"><a name="pos3076"></a>think they had already passed on all the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3077"><a name="pos3077"></a>ADV FORD:   I am sorry we are going in circles here Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3078"><a name="pos3078"></a>Nieuwoudt, because we get to your statement I believe.  You are </p>
<p class="line" id="line3079"><a name="pos3079"></a>talking about a decision to kill four people.  What I asked you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3080"><a name="pos3080"></a>before and which I will now ask you again is what led you to believe </p>
<p class="line" id="line3081"><a name="pos3081"></a>that they hadn't given all the information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3082"><a name="pos3082"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I have said, that is what I believed at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3083"><a name="pos3083"></a>stage.  Because the ANC did not immediately extract all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3084"><a name="pos3084"></a>information from them, they would do it on a gradual basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3085"><a name="pos3085"></a>	They do it in stages, not all at once.  Because they also had to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3086"><a name="pos3086"></a>test his credibility, they don't just accept that the person was telling </p>
<p class="line" id="line3087"><a name="pos3087"></a>the truth.  He might have been a double agent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3088"><a name="pos3088"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   What we are talking about here is the giving of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3089"><a name="pos3089"></a>information, not the extracting of the information.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3090"><a name="pos3090"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.  Yes, but at that stage I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3091"><a name="pos3091"></a>believed that they hadn't yet furnished all the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3092"><a name="pos3092"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the question is why on what basis did </p>
<p class="line" id="line3093"><a name="pos3093"></a>you have that belief that they hadn't yet given all the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3094"><a name="pos3094"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Because they would have had to be debriefed </p>
<p class="line" id="line3095"><a name="pos3095"></a>properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3096"><a name="pos3096"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think he is saying his sole reason for so </p>
<p class="line" id="line3097"><a name="pos3097"></a>believing is that they had not been debriefed.  I don't think we can </p>
<p class="line" id="line3098"><a name="pos3098"></a>take it further than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3099"><a name="pos3099"></a>ADV FORD:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Just getting back to an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3100"><a name="pos3100"></a>aspect which I referred to earlier Mr Nieuwoudt, I am going to read </p>
<p class="line" id="line3101"><a name="pos3101"></a>to you from subsection 7 of subsection 3, or shall we say regulation </p>
<p class="line" id="line3102"><a name="pos3102"></a>3, sub-regulation 7 of the Security Emergency Regulations of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3103"><a name="pos3103"></a>time.  No person other than the Minister or a person acting by virtue </p>
<p class="line" id="line3104"><a name="pos3104"></a>of his office in the service of the State or of the government of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3105"><a name="pos3105"></a>self governing territory, shall have access to a person detained in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3106"><a name="pos3106"></a>terms of this regulation except with the consent of and subject to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3107"><a name="pos3107"></a>such conditions that may be determined by the Minister or a person </p>
<p class="line" id="line3108"><a name="pos3108"></a>authorised thereto by him.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3109"><a name="pos3109"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3110"><a name="pos3110"></a>ADV FORD:   Was that how you understood the Emergency </p>
<p class="line" id="line3111"><a name="pos3111"></a>Regulations at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3112"><a name="pos3112"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Which one are you referring to, is it 85 or 86?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3113"><a name="pos3113"></a>ADV FORD:   I am referring to Security Emergency Regulations, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3114"><a name="pos3114"></a>number R86 of 1989.  Which given under my hand signed P.W. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3115"><a name="pos3115"></a>Botha, 8th day of June 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3116"><a name="pos3116"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As far as I know, if he has consent from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3117"><a name="pos3117"></a>Minister for somebody to visit him, and his legal counsel, they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3118"><a name="pos3118"></a>there daily involved with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3119"><a name="pos3119"></a>ADV FORD:   But we are talking about circumstances where you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3120"><a name="pos3120"></a>specifically don't want him to get permission to consult with his </p>
<p class="line" id="line3121"><a name="pos3121"></a>family or with his legal representatives and then you advise the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3122"><a name="pos3122"></a>Minister accordingly and he doesn't give the permission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3123"><a name="pos3123"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, but as I have said that access </p>
<p class="line" id="line3124"><a name="pos3124"></a>to legal representation, you cannot prevent that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3125"><a name="pos3125"></a>ADV FORD:   But isn't that precisely what that section says.  No </p>
<p class="line" id="line3126"><a name="pos3126"></a>person without the consent of the Minister shall have access to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3127"><a name="pos3127"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, but he approaches the Minister </p>
<p class="line" id="line3128"><a name="pos3128"></a>directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3129"><a name="pos3129"></a>ADV FORD:   Are you suggesting the Minister would not have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3130"><a name="pos3130"></a>conferred with those who had ensured the detainee's detention </p>
<p class="line" id="line3131"><a name="pos3131"></a>before granting such consent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3132"><a name="pos3132"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, what I am saying is that he will get the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3133"><a name="pos3133"></a>recommendation from the Commanding Officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3134"><a name="pos3134"></a>ADV FORD:   And how simple would it have been for you then to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3135"><a name="pos3135"></a>say no, sir, do not give the people consent, he is in possession of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3136"><a name="pos3136"></a>sensitive information which can lead to injury and death of other </p>
<p class="line" id="line3137"><a name="pos3137"></a>people.  He mustn't have contact with other people.  You could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3138"><a name="pos3138"></a>done that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3139"><a name="pos3139"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It could have been like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3140"><a name="pos3140"></a>ADV FORD:   Then there was no need to kill these persons, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3141"><a name="pos3141"></a>there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3142"><a name="pos3142"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I did not make that decision, I did not want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3143"><a name="pos3143"></a>kill them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3144"><a name="pos3144"></a>ADV FORD:   You then refer also at page 329 of your affidavit Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3145"><a name="pos3145"></a>Nieuwoudt, I am reading the last sentence, and the direct </p>
<p class="line" id="line3146"><a name="pos3146"></a>consequence of the leaking of this sensitive information was that a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3147"><a name="pos3147"></a>source was detained in the Quatro camp in Angola to be interrogated </p>
<p class="line" id="line3148"><a name="pos3148"></a>and then we refer to annexure 15 and 20.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3149"><a name="pos3149"></a>	Now, annexure 15 deals with the party triumphant from 1969 </p>
<p class="line" id="line3150"><a name="pos3150"></a>to 1975 through to mutiny in 1984.  Could you explain how this had </p>
<p class="line" id="line3151"><a name="pos3151"></a>any relevance to this incident in 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3152"><a name="pos3152"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   All I wanted to indicate there was that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3153"><a name="pos3153"></a>people were detained in the Quatro camp.  Some of them were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3154"><a name="pos3154"></a>detained in Quatro camp after the unrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3155"><a name="pos3155"></a>ADV FORD:   And then we have also, or the Commission with </p>
<p class="line" id="line3156"><a name="pos3156"></a>respect, is referred to the unsigned statement of one Maqonga, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3157"><a name="pos3157"></a>annexure 20 at page 490.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3158"><a name="pos3158"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3159"><a name="pos3159"></a>ADV FORD:   That deals with, if we are to place any reliance on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3160"><a name="pos3160"></a>this whatsoever, with what happened to him in 1985 and I think that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3161"><a name="pos3161"></a>is the latest date I can find in that affidavit or what purports to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3162"><a name="pos3162"></a>some sort of statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3163"><a name="pos3163"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3164"><a name="pos3164"></a>ADV FORD:   What earthly relevance has that got to an incident in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3165"><a name="pos3165"></a>1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3166"><a name="pos3166"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I have already said this was just in support </p>
<p class="line" id="line3167"><a name="pos3167"></a>of the fact there was a Quatro camp where people were detained and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3168"><a name="pos3168"></a>interrogated and this was precisely what happened to Maqonga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3169"><a name="pos3169"></a>ADV FORD:   And then over the page, Mr Nieuwoudt, you deal with </p>
<p class="line" id="line3170"><a name="pos3170"></a>this interrogation was done by the late Chris Hani and the purpose </p>
<p class="line" id="line3171"><a name="pos3171"></a>was to create a profile of myself and the role of the Intelligence and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3172"><a name="pos3172"></a>the role of the SACP/ANC alliance.  	Well, now it became personal </p>
<p class="line" id="line3173"><a name="pos3173"></a>didn't it, there was a profile being set up of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3174"><a name="pos3174"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3175"><a name="pos3175"></a>ADV FORD:   A profile which could have been used to attack you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3176"><a name="pos3176"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was possible yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3177"><a name="pos3177"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, in so far as the Intelligence Unit, that is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3178"><a name="pos3178"></a>Unit which you say came into being in June 1989, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3179"><a name="pos3179"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3180"><a name="pos3180"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, not too much could surely have passed in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3181"><a name="pos3181"></a>time in the few months from its creation to when this information </p>
<p class="line" id="line3182"><a name="pos3182"></a>was being made available to you, Mr Nieuwoudt, or is that an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3183"><a name="pos3183"></a>incorrect statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3184"><a name="pos3184"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3185"><a name="pos3185"></a>ADV FORD:   Why was this other then for the personal profile of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3186"><a name="pos3186"></a>yourself, why was this of any great relevance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3187"><a name="pos3187"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   All I am saying here is after that informer who </p>
<p class="line" id="line3188"><a name="pos3188"></a>was exposed, when he came back, he told me that, that is why I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3189"><a name="pos3189"></a>included that.  This was why I mentioned this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3190"><a name="pos3190"></a>ADV FORD:   Where did you get the information that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3191"><a name="pos3191"></a>interrogation was conducted by the late Chris Hani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3192"><a name="pos3192"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I heard it from my source.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3193"><a name="pos3193"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you speak to this man personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3194"><a name="pos3194"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3195"><a name="pos3195"></a>ADV FORD:   Where did that take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3196"><a name="pos3196"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Here in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3197"><a name="pos3197"></a>ADV FORD:   So this man was able to move from Lesotho to Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line3198"><a name="pos3198"></a>Elizabeth and back again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3199"><a name="pos3199"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3200"><a name="pos3200"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, how did he know what was happening in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3201"><a name="pos3201"></a>Lesotho then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3202"><a name="pos3202"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   In this case I am referring to Quatro, that is in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3203"><a name="pos3203"></a>Angola.  That is not in Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3204"><a name="pos3204"></a>ADV FORD:   I am sorry, I am referring to the beginning of that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3205"><a name="pos3205"></a>paragraph where you say information was received via an informer in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3206"><a name="pos3206"></a>Lesotho.  Could you explain the mechanics there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3207"><a name="pos3207"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is like that.  We had a whole intelligence </p>
<p class="line" id="line3208"><a name="pos3208"></a>network where he conveyed the information to me via courier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3209"><a name="pos3209"></a>ADV FORD:   I am sorry Mr Nieuwoudt, your informer was in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3210"><a name="pos3210"></a>Lesotho, is that what this paragraph is saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3211"><a name="pos3211"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Is that the previous paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3212"><a name="pos3212"></a>ADV FORD:   It is 25, no it is the same paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3213"><a name="pos3213"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was like that yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3214"><a name="pos3214"></a>ADV FORD:   What is so?  Was your informant in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3215"><a name="pos3215"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3216"><a name="pos3216"></a>ADV FORD:   And you spoke to him in Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3217"><a name="pos3217"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3218"><a name="pos3218"></a>ADV FORD:   So then he moved from Lesotho to Port Elizabeth to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3219"><a name="pos3219"></a>speak to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3220"><a name="pos3220"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, he used the intelligence network and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3221"><a name="pos3221"></a>was how he conveyed the information to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3222"><a name="pos3222"></a>ADV FORD:   But you spoke to him personally, Mr Nieuwoudt, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3223"><a name="pos3223"></a>just told us that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3224"><a name="pos3224"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I was under the impression you were referring </p>
<p class="line" id="line3225"><a name="pos3225"></a>to this case of Chris Hani.  I am on page 35 already.  I am sorry if I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3226"><a name="pos3226"></a>have misinterpreted you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3227"><a name="pos3227"></a>ADV FORD:   We are talking about the same thing Mr Nieuwoudt, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3228"><a name="pos3228"></a>is the same paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3229"><a name="pos3229"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3230"><a name="pos3230"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   I think you are at cross purposes.  He received </p>
<p class="line" id="line3231"><a name="pos3231"></a>information from a informer in Lesotho, but he is annexing an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3232"><a name="pos3232"></a>affidavit which was made much later which confirms what the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3233"><a name="pos3233"></a>informer said to him that there was a camp like Quatro and there </p>
<p class="line" id="line3234"><a name="pos3234"></a>were people detained in Quatro.  I think that is the only reason why </p>
<p class="line" id="line3235"><a name="pos3235"></a>he is annexing this, as I understood his evidence why he is annexing </p>
<p class="line" id="line3236"><a name="pos3236"></a>those annexures.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3237"><a name="pos3237"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3238"><a name="pos3238"></a>ADV FORD:   Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3239"><a name="pos3239"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3240"><a name="pos3240"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, then we get back to what my real question was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3241"><a name="pos3241"></a>and that is the informant from Lesotho, did you speak to him </p>
<p class="line" id="line3242"><a name="pos3242"></a>personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3243"><a name="pos3243"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3244"><a name="pos3244"></a>ADV FORD:   You got it conveyed to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3245"><a name="pos3245"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3246"><a name="pos3246"></a>ADV FORD:   How many people were involved in the conveyance of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3247"><a name="pos3247"></a>this information to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3248"><a name="pos3248"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I worked this according to a courier system, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3249"><a name="pos3249"></a>where his report to me was in writing, it was encoded and he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3250"><a name="pos3250"></a>doing target analysis in Lesotho and that information was conveyed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3251"><a name="pos3251"></a>ADV FORD:   So you had a written report from your informer in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3252"><a name="pos3252"></a>Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3253"><a name="pos3253"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3254"><a name="pos3254"></a>ADV FORD:   Do we have that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3255"><a name="pos3255"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3256"><a name="pos3256"></a>ADV FORD:   Brigadier Gilbert got that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3257"><a name="pos3257"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3258"><a name="pos3258"></a>ADV FORD:   Who got that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3259"><a name="pos3259"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It went to the Security Branch and in 1991, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3260"><a name="pos3260"></a>these files were sent to head quarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3261"><a name="pos3261"></a>ADV FORD:   So if you were so able to intercept mail and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3262"><a name="pos3262"></a>documents going out, did you have any reason to suspect that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3263"><a name="pos3263"></a>ANC weren't able to intercept documents coming this way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3264"><a name="pos3264"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was possible, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3265"><a name="pos3265"></a>ADV FORD:   So the ANC might well have intercepted written </p>
<p class="line" id="line3266"><a name="pos3266"></a>reports from this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3267"><a name="pos3267"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I don't think so.  Not in that instance.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line3268"><a name="pos3268"></a>only documents they could get hold of were those documents </p>
<p class="line" id="line3269"><a name="pos3269"></a>provided by the four deceased, but it could not have come from my </p>
<p class="line" id="line3270"><a name="pos3270"></a>own source.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3271"><a name="pos3271"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Could they not intercept in one or other way the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3272"><a name="pos3272"></a>letter from the courier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3273"><a name="pos3273"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   If that information was known to everybody in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3274"><a name="pos3274"></a>the network, it could have happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3275"><a name="pos3275"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Nieuwoudt, you are an experienced Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line3276"><a name="pos3276"></a>Policeman, you have referred to a lot of the literature, you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3277"><a name="pos3277"></a>referred to John McEwan, is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3278"><a name="pos3278"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3279"><a name="pos3279"></a>ADV FORD:   Do you know of work by Brigadier Fraser, are you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3280"><a name="pos3280"></a>aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3281"><a name="pos3281"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I can't think of that now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3282"><a name="pos3282"></a>ADV FORD:   Okay, you read extensively in so far as literature is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3283"><a name="pos3283"></a>concerned, relating to security, insurgency, counter-insurgency, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3284"><a name="pos3284"></a>intelligence, counter-intelligence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3285"><a name="pos3285"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3286"><a name="pos3286"></a>ADV FORD:   What is the value of a Security Police operation of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3287"><a name="pos3287"></a>double agent?  When you have somebody who is feeding information </p>
<p class="line" id="line3288"><a name="pos3288"></a>both ways, as it were?  Is that an important thing to have, is such a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3289"><a name="pos3289"></a>person important to the operation of a network?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3290"><a name="pos3290"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   If he is a double agent, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3291"><a name="pos3291"></a>ADV FORD:   What about somebody who believes, who has turned, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3292"><a name="pos3292"></a>as you say Mgoduka and the others have done, who has turned and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3293"><a name="pos3293"></a>he is feeding information to the other side, you know that he is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3294"><a name="pos3294"></a>feeding information.  He doesn't know that you know, you can feed </p>
<p class="line" id="line3295"><a name="pos3295"></a>him disinformation and he will in turn feed it to the people whom he </p>
<p class="line" id="line3296"><a name="pos3296"></a>is working for, would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3297"><a name="pos3297"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3298"><a name="pos3298"></a>ADV FORD:   And it is vitally important to have such a person, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3299"><a name="pos3299"></a>would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3300"><a name="pos3300"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, but I can explain that it can </p>
<p class="line" id="line3301"><a name="pos3301"></a>cause an additional problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3302"><a name="pos3302"></a>ADV FORD:   What is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3303"><a name="pos3303"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is that the ANC will realise that we have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3304"><a name="pos3304"></a>knowledge or that we know that he is a double agent and they will </p>
<p class="line" id="line3305"><a name="pos3305"></a>use him any more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3306"><a name="pos3306"></a>ADV FORD:   But you can make good use of him before that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3307"><a name="pos3307"></a>happens, surely Mr Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3308"><a name="pos3308"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, it could be, I am just posing an example.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3309"><a name="pos3309"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, then you don't kill such a person, you use him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3310"><a name="pos3310"></a>don't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3311"><a name="pos3311"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It is so, but I did not decide to have him killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3312"><a name="pos3312"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   And Mr Nieuwoudt, if the other side finds out </p>
<p class="line" id="line3313"><a name="pos3313"></a>that this person, that the opposite side knows that he is a double </p>
<p class="line" id="line3314"><a name="pos3314"></a>agent, it is not your problem, it is a problem for them, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3315"><a name="pos3315"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It is a problem for them and they had to make </p>
<p class="line" id="line3316"><a name="pos3316"></a>a plan with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3317"><a name="pos3317"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   In other words, it is not necessary for you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3318"><a name="pos3318"></a>provide him with disinformation because he has no purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3319"><a name="pos3319"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3320"><a name="pos3320"></a>ADV FORD:   And if he has become worthless Mr Nieuwoudt, then </p>
<p class="line" id="line3321"><a name="pos3321"></a>there is no point in killing him, is there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3322"><a name="pos3322"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I am repeating, I did not make that decision to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3323"><a name="pos3323"></a>kill them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3324"><a name="pos3324"></a>ADV FORD:   You then say in paragraph 26 of your affidavit, at </p>
<p class="line" id="line3325"><a name="pos3325"></a>330, Mr Nieuwoudt, I started to intensively monitor these four </p>
<p class="line" id="line3326"><a name="pos3326"></a>members and it indicated that Mgoduka and Charles Jack was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3327"><a name="pos3327"></a>recruited by Godji Skenyana.  What do you mean you intensively </p>
<p class="line" id="line3328"><a name="pos3328"></a>monitored them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3329"><a name="pos3329"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I used sources on them, I monitored their post, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3330"><a name="pos3330"></a>I infiltrated their friends.  All those things, all those intelligence </p>
<p class="line" id="line3331"><a name="pos3331"></a>operations I used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3332"><a name="pos3332"></a>ADV FORD:   Well you are already tapping their phones, you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line3333"><a name="pos3333"></a>already intercepting their post, what else did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3334"><a name="pos3334"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   No, with respect, I think this far the evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line3335"><a name="pos3335"></a>was only Mgoduka's post was monitored and his phone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3336"><a name="pos3336"></a>ADV FORD:   Is that so Mr Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3337"><a name="pos3337"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3338"><a name="pos3338"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you then start monitoring the post of all four of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3339"><a name="pos3339"></a>them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3340"><a name="pos3340"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.  All of them and their friends </p>
<p class="line" id="line3341"><a name="pos3341"></a>as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3342"><a name="pos3342"></a>ADV FORD:   This information which you say confirmed beyond all </p>
<p class="line" id="line3343"><a name="pos3343"></a>doubt that they had been recruited, where did that come from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3344"><a name="pos3344"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   From an informer who lived in Lesotho very </p>
<p class="line" id="line3345"><a name="pos3345"></a>near to Skenyana.  He was a trained person, he was an agent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3346"><a name="pos3346"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you speak to that man or that person personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3347"><a name="pos3347"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, he was handled on the same basis on my </p>
<p class="line" id="line3348"><a name="pos3348"></a>network.  And other people, my associates, went in where they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3349"><a name="pos3349"></a>debriefed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3350"><a name="pos3350"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you have any reason, or was there any way of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3351"><a name="pos3351"></a>being certain that this wasn't disinformation that you were being fed </p>
<p class="line" id="line3352"><a name="pos3352"></a>to cause problems in the Security Branch in Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3353"><a name="pos3353"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I did not have any reason to believe that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3354"><a name="pos3354"></a>ADV FORD:   What I am suggesting to you Mr Nieuwoudt, is that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3355"><a name="pos3355"></a>might well have been the ANC or whoever was on the other side, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3356"><a name="pos3356"></a>feeding you disinformation to cause problems in your Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line3357"><a name="pos3357"></a>Branch?  Did you investigate that possibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3358"><a name="pos3358"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I have already mentioned, I believed that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3359"><a name="pos3359"></a>they were involved, that they were recruited, that is what I believed. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3360"><a name="pos3360"></a> That is how I saw that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3361"><a name="pos3361"></a>ADV FORD:   You have told the Commission that already.  I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line3362"><a name="pos3362"></a>asking you what your basis was for having such a firm belief.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3363"><a name="pos3363"></a>Whether you thought of investigating the possibility of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3364"><a name="pos3364"></a>disinformation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3365"><a name="pos3365"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I have already told you, I don't think it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3366"><a name="pos3366"></a>could have been disinformation.  The evidence was that my </p>
<p class="line" id="line3367"><a name="pos3367"></a>informers were eliminated.  Some of them were detained in Quatro.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3368"><a name="pos3368"></a>That was why I believed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3369"><a name="pos3369"></a>ADV FORD:   But you made no attempt to confirm that in any other </p>
<p class="line" id="line3370"><a name="pos3370"></a>way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3371"><a name="pos3371"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I was sure that the information I obtained </p>
<p class="line" id="line3372"><a name="pos3372"></a>from that informer was positive.  His information was evaluated and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3373"><a name="pos3373"></a>therefore I had no reason to doubt his information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3374"><a name="pos3374"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Nieuwoudt, then at page 331, you state that two </p>
<p class="line" id="line3375"><a name="pos3375"></a>weeks prior to 16 December 1989, they are talking about Godji </p>
<p class="line" id="line3376"><a name="pos3376"></a>contacted Warrant Officer Mgoduka to identify a South African </p>
<p class="line" id="line3377"><a name="pos3377"></a>Police vehicle for the purpose to attach a limpet mine underneath </p>
<p class="line" id="line3378"><a name="pos3378"></a>this vehicle.  Do I understand that Mgoduka was to do no more than </p>
<p class="line" id="line3379"><a name="pos3379"></a>identify the police motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3380"><a name="pos3380"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was the information we obtained.  That </p>
<p class="line" id="line3381"><a name="pos3381"></a>these four people had to identify the vehicle.  Mgoduka was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3382"><a name="pos3382"></a>principle person in this regard.  What instructions he gave, I did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3383"><a name="pos3383"></a>know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3384"><a name="pos3384"></a>ADV FORD:   But there was no question of them personally putting </p>
<p class="line" id="line3385"><a name="pos3385"></a>a limpet mine under the motor vehicle, they were only going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3386"><a name="pos3386"></a>identify it.?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3387"><a name="pos3387"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3388"><a name="pos3388"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you every tell anybody that your information was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3389"><a name="pos3389"></a>that they were going to blow a motor vehicle up by use of a limpet </p>
<p class="line" id="line3390"><a name="pos3390"></a>mine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3391"><a name="pos3391"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I remember, I conveyed the report to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3392"><a name="pos3392"></a>Brigadier Gilbert, the report about what they were involved in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3393"><a name="pos3393"></a>ADV FORD:   My question is have you ever told anybody that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3394"><a name="pos3394"></a>personally were going to blow up a police motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3395"><a name="pos3395"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I have already said I told Gilbert that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3396"><a name="pos3396"></a>ADV FORD:   But that wasn't your information, your information </p>
<p class="line" id="line3397"><a name="pos3397"></a>was that they were going to identify the motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3398"><a name="pos3398"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, but I believe what the informer </p>
<p class="line" id="line3399"><a name="pos3399"></a>said that they would provide a limpet mine to them on the 16th of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3400"><a name="pos3400"></a>December to show their solidarity and also to test them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3401"><a name="pos3401"></a>ADV FORD:   Are you making this up as you go along Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3402"><a name="pos3402"></a>Nieuwoudt, because this isn't contained in your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3403"><a name="pos3403"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3404"><a name="pos3404"></a>ADV FORD:   All you are talking about here is Mgoduka to identify </p>
<p class="line" id="line3405"><a name="pos3405"></a>a South African Police vehicle with the purposes of putting a limpet </p>
<p class="line" id="line3406"><a name="pos3406"></a>mine under this vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3407"><a name="pos3407"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It is so, here I have stated that who would </p>
<p class="line" id="line3408"><a name="pos3408"></a>place the limpet mine, I don't know, but the purpose was to put a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3409"><a name="pos3409"></a>limpet mine under this vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3410"><a name="pos3410"></a>ADV FORD:   But that was precisely why, because it was unclear </p>
<p class="line" id="line3411"><a name="pos3411"></a>here why I asked you moments ago, if the only information was that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3412"><a name="pos3412"></a>they would identify a police motor vehicle, not place the bomb </p>
<p class="line" id="line3413"><a name="pos3413"></a>themselves and you agreed with that?  Are you changing that now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3414"><a name="pos3414"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, for those purposes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3415"><a name="pos3415"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, sorry, I don't understand this argument.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3416"><a name="pos3416"></a>You divide that sentence into two parts Mr Ford?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3417"><a name="pos3417"></a>ADV FORD:   That is so Mr Chairman, and I am leading with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3418"><a name="pos3418"></a>question that I asked him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3419"><a name="pos3419"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you divide that sentence into two </p>
<p class="line" id="line3420"><a name="pos3420"></a>independent portions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3421"><a name="pos3421"></a>ADV FORD:   No, Mr Chairman, I asked him to do that.  I asked </p>
<p class="line" id="line3422"><a name="pos3422"></a>him if his information was only that they would identify the motor </p>
<p class="line" id="line3423"><a name="pos3423"></a>vehicle and not personally be involved in the bombing and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line3424"><a name="pos3424"></a>confirmed, because it was unclear, that is why I asked him.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line3425"><a name="pos3425"></a>confirmed that and now he is saying Mr Chairman ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3426"><a name="pos3426"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   It doesn't matter to me what his answer is.  If the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3427"><a name="pos3427"></a>question was not on a proper footing, it doesn't matter to me what </p>
<p class="line" id="line3428"><a name="pos3428"></a>his answer is.  I am worried about the only, you say to us that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3429"><a name="pos3429"></a>asked him whether that was the only thing that had to be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3430"><a name="pos3430"></a>ADV FORD:   Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3431"><a name="pos3431"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   But you knew that the sentence didn't end up </p>
<p class="line" id="line3432"><a name="pos3432"></a>there, you knew that it went further to say that, to state the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3433"><a name="pos3433"></a>purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3434"><a name="pos3434"></a>ADV FORD:   That a limpet mine was going to be placed under the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3435"><a name="pos3435"></a>car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3436"><a name="pos3436"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3437"><a name="pos3437"></a>ADV FORD:   Yes, Mr Chairman.  But without identifying the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3438"><a name="pos3438"></a>person who was going to do that, which is specifically why I asked </p>
<p class="line" id="line3439"><a name="pos3439"></a>him the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3440"><a name="pos3440"></a>	Mr Chairman, may I just clear up the question then if there is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3441"><a name="pos3441"></a>uncertainty.  I don't want to mislead the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3442"><a name="pos3442"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, maybe you should do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3443"><a name="pos3443"></a>ADV FORD:   Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.  What is your evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line3444"><a name="pos3444"></a>Mr Nieuwoudt, was the information from your informant that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3445"><a name="pos3445"></a>would only identify the motor vehicle or were they also going to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3446"><a name="pos3446"></a>involved in the placing of the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3447"><a name="pos3447"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   As I have said, they had to identify a vehicle </p>
<p class="line" id="line3448"><a name="pos3448"></a>for the purposes of putting a limpet mine there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3449"><a name="pos3449"></a>ADV FORD:   They would do the bombing themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3450"><a name="pos3450"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3451"><a name="pos3451"></a>ADV FORD:   I see. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3452"><a name="pos3452"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Did you consider the possibility that that could </p>
<p class="line" id="line3453"><a name="pos3453"></a>have been disinformation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3454"><a name="pos3454"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, not at that stage as far as I can remember. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3455"><a name="pos3455"></a> I did not consider that possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3456"><a name="pos3456"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Especially in the light of the fact that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3457"><a name="pos3457"></a>were busy to obtain on a fraudulent way, funds which belonged to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3458"><a name="pos3458"></a>the liberation movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3459"><a name="pos3459"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I don't have any knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3460"><a name="pos3460"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   It could have been that the liberation </p>
<p class="line" id="line3461"><a name="pos3461"></a>movement decided if that was what they were doing, we would place </p>
<p class="line" id="line3462"><a name="pos3462"></a>that disinformation in your system?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3463"><a name="pos3463"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, it could have been like that, but that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3464"><a name="pos3464"></a>informer was an evaluated informer and I could trust him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3465"><a name="pos3465"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But you say you did not consider that option, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3466"><a name="pos3466"></a>that possibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3467"><a name="pos3467"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3468"><a name="pos3468"></a>ADV FORD:   Thank you.  Mr Nieuwoudt, if I could then go to page </p>
<p class="line" id="line3469"><a name="pos3469"></a>332, this is paragraph 29 of your application.  Do I understand the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3470"><a name="pos3470"></a>contents of that paragraph correctly to mean what you stated earlier, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3471"><a name="pos3471"></a>that the ANC would only use small amounts of information given to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3472"><a name="pos3472"></a>them, they wouldn't use all the information, because that would </p>
<p class="line" id="line3473"><a name="pos3473"></a>reveal their source?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3474"><a name="pos3474"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3475"><a name="pos3475"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, that must have immediately made it clear to you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3476"><a name="pos3476"></a>that the ANC must have already have substantial other information, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3477"><a name="pos3477"></a>or have certain other information if they are only using a portion of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3478"><a name="pos3478"></a>it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3479"><a name="pos3479"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   With respect Mr Chairman, that doesn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line3480"><a name="pos3480"></a>necessarily follow.  It doesn't quantify what information, it is just an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3481"><a name="pos3481"></a>opinion that he expressed.  I will concede the paragraph is not very </p>
<p class="line" id="line3482"><a name="pos3482"></a>clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3483"><a name="pos3483"></a>ADV FORD:   Who drafted this Mr Nieuwoudt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3484"><a name="pos3484"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   My Attorney.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3485"><a name="pos3485"></a>ADV FORD:   Presumably you read it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3486"><a name="pos3486"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3487"><a name="pos3487"></a>ADV FORD:   And you were satisfied with the contents thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3488"><a name="pos3488"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Your Honour, it is so, but it is ambiguous.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3489"><a name="pos3489"></a>This was my opinion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3490"><a name="pos3490"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, let's go to something which isn't ambiguous, at </p>
<p class="line" id="line3491"><a name="pos3491"></a>333, 31.  I immediately told Brigadier Gilbert that this state of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3492"><a name="pos3492"></a>affairs necessitated drastic measures because the Intelligence </p>
<p class="line" id="line3493"><a name="pos3493"></a>Network was of no use for the Security Branch.  You made it quite </p>
<p class="line" id="line3494"><a name="pos3494"></a>clear to Brigadier Gilbert that you thought that drastic measures </p>
<p class="line" id="line3495"><a name="pos3495"></a>were necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3496"><a name="pos3496"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3497"><a name="pos3497"></a>ADV FORD:   Could that mean anything else to him but that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3498"><a name="pos3498"></a>were suggesting that these men should be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3499"><a name="pos3499"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I did not tell him that they should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3500"><a name="pos3500"></a>eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3501"><a name="pos3501"></a>ADV FORD:   Yes, I know, you have already said that.  I am saying </p>
<p class="line" id="line3502"><a name="pos3502"></a>can this sentence mean anything other than that you suggested that, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3503"><a name="pos3503"></a>that it was implicit in what you were saying to them, that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3504"><a name="pos3504"></a>should be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3505"><a name="pos3505"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3506"><a name="pos3506"></a>ADV FORD:   So you for yourself decided that the only way out, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3507"><a name="pos3507"></a>was to kill them, at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3508"><a name="pos3508"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3509"><a name="pos3509"></a>ADV FORD:   Then we go on to 32, Mr Nieuwoudt.  Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line3510"><a name="pos3510"></a>Gilbert instructed me to launch an operation to eliminate these </p>
<p class="line" id="line3511"><a name="pos3511"></a>people.  Then I suggested to him that this should be managed on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3512"><a name="pos3512"></a>such a way that the blame could be placed on the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3513"><a name="pos3513"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Before my learned friend carries on, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3514"><a name="pos3514"></a>specifically was, that is the one sentence that was specifically </p>
<p class="line" id="line3515"><a name="pos3515"></a>amended, he said that there was some error in it.  I think in fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line3516"><a name="pos3516"></a>even Mr De Jager queried it as to how it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3517"><a name="pos3517"></a>ADV FORD:   That is precisely so Mr Chairman, that is why I want </p>
<p class="line" id="line3518"><a name="pos3518"></a>to deal with it with the man who says he has read through the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3519"><a name="pos3519"></a>application and he was happy with it, how such an unambiguous </p>
<p class="line" id="line3520"><a name="pos3520"></a>sentence could have been contained in it.  Could you answer that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3521"><a name="pos3521"></a>Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3522"><a name="pos3522"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   During consultation I realised that this was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3523"><a name="pos3523"></a>the case.  These words were switched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3524"><a name="pos3524"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Nieuwoudt, you were sentenced to 20 years </p>
<p class="line" id="line3525"><a name="pos3525"></a>imprisonment for this incident, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3526"><a name="pos3526"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3527"><a name="pos3527"></a>ADV FORD:   This is your only chance other than the possibility of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3528"><a name="pos3528"></a>an appeal which may or may not succeed, of not serving that 20 </p>
<p class="line" id="line3529"><a name="pos3529"></a>years, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3530"><a name="pos3530"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, but I did not give the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3531"><a name="pos3531"></a>instruction to eliminate them.  And this was why I brought this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3532"><a name="pos3532"></a>under his attention when we consulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3533"><a name="pos3533"></a>ADV FORD:   Are you suggesting that you did not consult in detail </p>
<p class="line" id="line3534"><a name="pos3534"></a>with your Attorneys before this was prepared?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3535"><a name="pos3535"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   We did, yes.  Everything was tape recorded </p>
<p class="line" id="line3536"><a name="pos3536"></a>and typed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3537"><a name="pos3537"></a>ADV FORD:   And you read through it before you signed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3538"><a name="pos3538"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3539"><a name="pos3539"></a>ADV FORD:   And you were happy with it as it then stood?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3540"><a name="pos3540"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   After that, when we discussed this in depth, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3541"><a name="pos3541"></a>did read through that and I signed it.  There were many other </p>
<p class="line" id="line3542"><a name="pos3542"></a>applications I handed in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3543"><a name="pos3543"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Nieuwoudt, it is a matter which has been touched </p>
<p class="line" id="line3544"><a name="pos3544"></a>on from time to time and there seems to be differing views in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3545"><a name="pos3545"></a>regard, but you are a explosive expert yourself, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3546"><a name="pos3546"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3547"><a name="pos3547"></a>ADV FORD:   And you have undergone certain courses with regard </p>
<p class="line" id="line3548"><a name="pos3548"></a>to explosives and dealing with explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3549"><a name="pos3549"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3550"><a name="pos3550"></a>ADV FORD:   You are capable of setting a bomb?  Preparing a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3551"><a name="pos3551"></a>bomb, fusing it?  Setting it off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3552"><a name="pos3552"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3553"><a name="pos3553"></a>ADV FORD:   The intention at all times was that this was going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3554"><a name="pos3554"></a>be the manner of elimination of these four men?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3555"><a name="pos3555"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3556"><a name="pos3556"></a>ADV FORD:   Why couldn't you do it yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3557"><a name="pos3557"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Because I was not so professional.  We needed </p>
<p class="line" id="line3558"><a name="pos3558"></a>more professional operatives.  I am not a technical expert.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3559"><a name="pos3559"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, there was little professionalism about plan B, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3560"><a name="pos3560"></a>was there, shooting the men in the car as they drove past as an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3561"><a name="pos3561"></a>alternative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3562"><a name="pos3562"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was only plan B, if A did not succeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3563"><a name="pos3563"></a>ADV FORD:   Your trip to Pretoria was authorised from head office </p>
<p class="line" id="line3564"><a name="pos3564"></a>if I understand your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3565"><a name="pos3565"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3566"><a name="pos3566"></a>ADV FORD:   Head office in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3567"><a name="pos3567"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.  Could I just explain here.  If I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3568"><a name="pos3568"></a>receive authorization, it is authorised for the requisition of a vehicle </p>
<p class="line" id="line3569"><a name="pos3569"></a>- for that I have to have authority from head office.  It was done in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3570"><a name="pos3570"></a>writing or by telephone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3571"><a name="pos3571"></a>ADV FORD:   If the Commission will bear with me.  The reason I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3572"><a name="pos3572"></a>am asking Mr Nieuwoudt, is that this requisition which is being </p>
<p class="line" id="line3573"><a name="pos3573"></a>handed in as an exhibit, is signed by - I don't know if it is signed by, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3574"><a name="pos3574"></a>but the authority appears to have been given by General Van der </p>
<p class="line" id="line3575"><a name="pos3575"></a>Merwe, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3576"><a name="pos3576"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3577"><a name="pos3577"></a>ADV FORD:   And what was his position at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3578"><a name="pos3578"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I think he was the Commissioner of Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3579"><a name="pos3579"></a>ADV FORD:   Do you have any reason to believe that he would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3580"><a name="pos3580"></a>granted such authority without being fully aware of the nature of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3581"><a name="pos3581"></a>operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3582"><a name="pos3582"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I don't know.  I can't comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3583"><a name="pos3583"></a>ADV FORD:   Were you ever in other circumstances required to put </p>
<p class="line" id="line3584"><a name="pos3584"></a>in requests for air tickets and the like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3585"><a name="pos3585"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3586"><a name="pos3586"></a>ADV FORD:   And did you have to disclose fully the nature of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3587"><a name="pos3587"></a>operation and what was involved in order to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3588"><a name="pos3588"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I just received approval from the Commanding </p>
<p class="line" id="line3589"><a name="pos3589"></a>Officer and he obtained the authorization.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3590"><a name="pos3590"></a>ADV FORD:  Now you say in paragraph 34 of your affidavit, at 334, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3591"><a name="pos3591"></a>on the afternoon of 12 December 1989, I was called to Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line3592"><a name="pos3592"></a>Gilbert's office and he told me that approval was given for this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3593"><a name="pos3593"></a>covert operation.  Presumably your evidence is that you have no idea </p>
<p class="line" id="line3594"><a name="pos3594"></a>who that authority came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3595"><a name="pos3595"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3596"><a name="pos3596"></a>ADV FORD:   At the same time he gave me a air ticket and said I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3597"><a name="pos3597"></a>had to fly to Pretoria where I had to contact Van Rensburg early the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3598"><a name="pos3598"></a>next morning for the logistical support to be discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3599"><a name="pos3599"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3600"><a name="pos3600"></a>ADV FORD:   Now, you knew Mr Van Rensburg well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3601"><a name="pos3601"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3602"><a name="pos3602"></a>ADV FORD:   You were actively involved with him in the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line3603"><a name="pos3603"></a>Branch in Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3604"><a name="pos3604"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3605"><a name="pos3605"></a>ADV FORD:   He was present in Port Elizabeth at the time of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3606"><a name="pos3606"></a>Goniwe murders, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3607"><a name="pos3607"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3608"><a name="pos3608"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Lotz, who testified yesterday, do you know him </p>
<p class="line" id="line3609"><a name="pos3609"></a>well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3610"><a name="pos3610"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I know him, he worked with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3611"><a name="pos3611"></a>ADV FORD:   Do you know of any relationship between Mr Lotz </p>
<p class="line" id="line3612"><a name="pos3612"></a>and Mr Van Rensburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3613"><a name="pos3613"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3614"><a name="pos3614"></a>ADV FORD:   What is that relationship?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3615"><a name="pos3615"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is his father-in-law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3616"><a name="pos3616"></a>ADV FORD:   Then you say at this stage Gilbert told me that Eric </p>
<p class="line" id="line3617"><a name="pos3617"></a>Strydom contacted him regarding allegations of a fraud regarding </p>
<p class="line" id="line3618"><a name="pos3618"></a>Mgoduka and Sehati.  We did not discuss this any further because </p>
<p class="line" id="line3619"><a name="pos3619"></a>the operation had been launched already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3620"><a name="pos3620"></a>	I understand that you mean that as far as you were concerned, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3621"><a name="pos3621"></a>it played no role whatsoever in the decision to kill these men?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3622"><a name="pos3622"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3623"><a name="pos3623"></a>ADV FORD:   Now, you have heard in so far as the questions which </p>
<p class="line" id="line3624"><a name="pos3624"></a>were put to you by my learned friend, Mr Hugo, that Mr De Kock's </p>
<p class="line" id="line3625"><a name="pos3625"></a>evidence is going to be that in fact in the first instance that was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3626"><a name="pos3626"></a>only thing that was mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3627"><a name="pos3627"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3628"><a name="pos3628"></a>ADV FORD:   Can you think of any reason why Mr De Kock would </p>
<p class="line" id="line3629"><a name="pos3629"></a>be lying about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3630"><a name="pos3630"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I don't think that he is lying, perhaps he has </p>
<p class="line" id="line3631"><a name="pos3631"></a>just forgotten about that if I have to speculate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3632"><a name="pos3632"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Nieuwoudt, I want to read to you briefly a section </p>
<p class="line" id="line3633"><a name="pos3633"></a>from the application for amnesty for Mr Ras and Mr Ras hasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line3634"><a name="pos3634"></a>testified yet, but we must assume that he is going to testify in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3635"><a name="pos3635"></a>accordance with what is contained in these documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3636"><a name="pos3636"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3637"><a name="pos3637"></a>ADV FORD:   I am reading from page 262 in the middle.  While we </p>
<p class="line" id="line3638"><a name="pos3638"></a>were having a braai here in Port Elizabeth with Carl Edwards and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3639"><a name="pos3639"></a>others, he also discussed this matter.  Carl Edwards mentioned that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3640"><a name="pos3640"></a>the operation was done with money by the ANC.  They intercepted </p>
<p class="line" id="line3641"><a name="pos3641"></a>the money and channelled that to the State.  That was the instruction </p>
<p class="line" id="line3642"><a name="pos3642"></a>by P.W. Botha and if they defected to the ANC, this would lead to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3643"><a name="pos3643"></a>embarrassment for the Security Police and the government because </p>
<p class="line" id="line3644"><a name="pos3644"></a>of the large amount of monies entering the country in support of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3645"><a name="pos3645"></a>ANC and other organisations, that was the only counter-measure to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3646"><a name="pos3646"></a>prevent these donors.  And it resulted in only new cheques being </p>
<p class="line" id="line3647"><a name="pos3647"></a>written and when these cheques - an d it could be assumed that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3648"><a name="pos3648"></a>used the money for their own gain.  And that would cause that no </p>
<p class="line" id="line3649"><a name="pos3649"></a>further donations would be made to the organisations.   I did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3650"><a name="pos3650"></a>have any knowledge of any monies of this kind which was meant for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3651"><a name="pos3651"></a>the treasurer.  Were you aware of such procedure, such an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3652"><a name="pos3652"></a>undertaking or that this was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3653"><a name="pos3653"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I don't have any knowledge of that.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3654"><a name="pos3654"></a>heard of that the first time during my hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3655"><a name="pos3655"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, when Brigadier Gilbert told you about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3656"><a name="pos3656"></a>suggestions of fraud against Mgoduka and Sehati, did you ask any </p>
<p class="line" id="line3657"><a name="pos3657"></a>further questions about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3658"><a name="pos3658"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3659"><a name="pos3659"></a>ADV FORD:   Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3660"><a name="pos3660"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It was not necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3661"><a name="pos3661"></a>ADV FORD:  But surely you were going up to brief Mr Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line3662"><a name="pos3662"></a>Rensburg and Mr De Kock if need be, as it turned out, you needed </p>
<p class="line" id="line3663"><a name="pos3663"></a>to be fully aware of all the relevant considerations in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3664"><a name="pos3664"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Brigadier Gilbert did not discuss this matter of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3665"><a name="pos3665"></a>fraud, this was not why they were eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3666"><a name="pos3666"></a>ADV FORD:   Would you say the primary reason then Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3667"><a name="pos3667"></a>Nieuwoudt, for the decision to eliminate the four men was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3668"><a name="pos3668"></a>possibility of them revealing information to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3669"><a name="pos3669"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, and also the planting of the bomb on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3670"><a name="pos3670"></a>16th of December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3671"><a name="pos3671"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, that you could have stopped merely be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3672"><a name="pos3672"></a>detaining them, they didn't have to kill them for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3673"><a name="pos3673"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   And what about the members of the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line3674"><a name="pos3674"></a>Branch, the Information Network, how could we combat then the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3675"><a name="pos3675"></a>ANC/SACP alliance and prevent the overthrow of the government of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3676"><a name="pos3676"></a>the day.  That was the total spectrum we had to take into </p>
<p class="line" id="line3677"><a name="pos3677"></a>consideration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3678"><a name="pos3678"></a>ADV FORD:   You were aware of the operation in which, what are </p>
<p class="line" id="line3679"><a name="pos3679"></a>frequently referred to as the Goniwe 4, were killed, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3680"><a name="pos3680"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, all that Gilbert told me was that some of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3681"><a name="pos3681"></a>these people were involved in the murder of Ford Galatha, Goniwe, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3682"><a name="pos3682"></a>Sparrow Mkhonto and the other one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3683"><a name="pos3683"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, then there could have been no doubt in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line3684"><a name="pos3684"></a>mind that that operation was also a Security Police operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3685"><a name="pos3685"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.  It was a sensitive operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3686"><a name="pos3686"></a>ADV FORD:   And when you went to speak to Mr Van Rensburg, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3687"><a name="pos3687"></a>was one of the  factors which you mentioned to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3688"><a name="pos3688"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3689"><a name="pos3689"></a>ADV FORD:   And he knew immediately what you were talking </p>
<p class="line" id="line3690"><a name="pos3690"></a>about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3691"><a name="pos3691"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I assume so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3692"><a name="pos3692"></a>ADV FORD:   You did not have to explain to him what you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3693"><a name="pos3693"></a>talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3694"><a name="pos3694"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I don't know whether he knew about everybody </p>
<p class="line" id="line3695"><a name="pos3695"></a>who was involved in the Goniwe murder.  And I just mentioned to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3696"><a name="pos3696"></a>him what Gilbert had conveyed to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3697"><a name="pos3697"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, we know that you two were involved besides </p>
<p class="line" id="line3698"><a name="pos3698"></a>this incident Mr Nieuwoudt, you two were involved in instances </p>
<p class="line" id="line3699"><a name="pos3699"></a>where for instance, last week I understood you testified that two </p>
<p class="line" id="line3700"><a name="pos3700"></a>young activists were killed by yourself and Mr Van Rensburg, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3701"><a name="pos3701"></a>right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3702"><a name="pos3702"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3703"><a name="pos3703"></a>ADV FORD:   And presumably I didn't hear the evidence, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3704"><a name="pos3704"></a>presume that you got authority for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3705"><a name="pos3705"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3706"><a name="pos3706"></a>ADV FORD:   And you would have been aware that the decision to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3707"><a name="pos3707"></a>kill the Goniwe four, authority would have been required?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3708"><a name="pos3708"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I believe so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3709"><a name="pos3709"></a>ADV FORD:   And the authority, if we were to understand your </p>
<p class="line" id="line3710"><a name="pos3710"></a>evidence here, would have been gotten firstly from the senior man or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3711"><a name="pos3711"></a>one of the senior men in Port Elizabeth and subsequently from head </p>
<p class="line" id="line3712"><a name="pos3712"></a>office in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3713"><a name="pos3713"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3714"><a name="pos3714"></a>ADV FORD:   Were you aware that Mr Van Rensburg was involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line3715"><a name="pos3715"></a>in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3716"><a name="pos3716"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3717"><a name="pos3717"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you have any reason to suspect that he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3718"><a name="pos3718"></a>involved in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3719"><a name="pos3719"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   In which case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3720"><a name="pos3720"></a>ADV FORD:   The case of Matthews Goniwe and his three </p>
<p class="line" id="line3721"><a name="pos3721"></a>colleagues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3722"><a name="pos3722"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I don't know.  I don't have any knowledge of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3723"><a name="pos3723"></a>that case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3724"><a name="pos3724"></a>ADV FORD:   But what we know without question is that Mr Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line3725"><a name="pos3725"></a>Rensburg didn't have to ask you any questions about what you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3726"><a name="pos3726"></a>talking about when you mentioned the Goniwe 4?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3727"><a name="pos3727"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   All that I conveyed to Van Rensburg was what </p>
<p class="line" id="line3728"><a name="pos3728"></a>Gilbert had told me, namely that three of these people were involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line3729"><a name="pos3729"></a>in the Goniwe incident, and I mentioned their names.  All four of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3730"><a name="pos3730"></a>those people involved in this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3731"><a name="pos3731"></a>ADV FORD:   Yes, but the question I am asking you Mr Nieuwoudt, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3732"><a name="pos3732"></a>is simply this, if Mr Van Rensburg wasn't already either involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line3733"><a name="pos3733"></a>himself or already aware that the Security Forces or the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line3734"><a name="pos3734"></a>Police had been directly involved in that killing, he would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3735"><a name="pos3735"></a>asked you but what about the Goniwe, we had nothing to do with </p>
<p class="line" id="line3736"><a name="pos3736"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3737"><a name="pos3737"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I don't know, he did not ask me that.  I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line3738"><a name="pos3738"></a>know whether he was involved.  I don't know which role he played, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3739"><a name="pos3739"></a>was not involved in that.  So I cannot draw that inference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3740"><a name="pos3740"></a>ADV FORD:   Do you know if his son-in-law, Mr Lotz, was directly </p>
<p class="line" id="line3741"><a name="pos3741"></a>involved in that murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3742"><a name="pos3742"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3743"><a name="pos3743"></a>ADV FORD:   You still don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3744"><a name="pos3744"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Now I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3745"><a name="pos3745"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, what do you know now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3746"><a name="pos3746"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That they applied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3747"><a name="pos3747"></a>ADV FORD:   Who is they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3748"><a name="pos3748"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   General Van Rensburg and Lotz.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3749"><a name="pos3749"></a>ADV FORD:   And if as you say Brigadier Gilbert conveyed to you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3750"><a name="pos3750"></a>that three of the persons involved had also been involved in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3751"><a name="pos3751"></a>Goniwe murders, if they did go over to the ANC, if they did convey </p>
<p class="line" id="line3752"><a name="pos3752"></a>the information to the ANC, they would have blown the whole story </p>
<p class="line" id="line3753"><a name="pos3753"></a>in so far as the Goniwe murders were concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3754"><a name="pos3754"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3755"><a name="pos3755"></a>ADV FORD:   And that, it appears, would have implicated Mr Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line3756"><a name="pos3756"></a>Rensburg and his son-in-law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3757"><a name="pos3757"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is what I know now, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3758"><a name="pos3758"></a>ADV FORD:   When you spoke firstly to Mr Van Rensburg, were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3759"><a name="pos3759"></a>you under the impression that he was fully aware of the whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line3760"><a name="pos3760"></a>operation, what was intended or did you have to brief him </p>
<p class="line" id="line3761"><a name="pos3761"></a>specifically as to what was required, what the problems were and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3762"><a name="pos3762"></a>what the intention was in so far as the elimination of these persons </p>
<p class="line" id="line3763"><a name="pos3763"></a>were concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3764"><a name="pos3764"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I don't think that I gave him the operational </p>
<p class="line" id="line3765"><a name="pos3765"></a>details.  What I did tell him was what the members' involvement </p>
<p class="line" id="line3766"><a name="pos3766"></a>would be and what they would be responsible for and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3767"><a name="pos3767"></a>information at our disposal at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3768"><a name="pos3768"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you tell him about the fraud?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3769"><a name="pos3769"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Maybe I mentioned it to him, and maybe </p>
<p class="line" id="line3770"><a name="pos3770"></a>Gilbert also mentioned it to him.  I don't know, but I did mention </p>
<p class="line" id="line3771"><a name="pos3771"></a>that two of them were involved in fraud.  I may have mentioned that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3772"><a name="pos3772"></a>ADV FORD:   Just getting for a moment to the involvement of all </p>
<p class="line" id="line3773"><a name="pos3773"></a>four these persons.  Up to now, if I read your amnesty application </p>
<p class="line" id="line3774"><a name="pos3774"></a>and the evidence you have given Mr  Nieuwoudt, you have been very </p>
<p class="line" id="line3775"><a name="pos3775"></a>specific about your information regarding Mr Mgoduka and Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3776"><a name="pos3776"></a>Sehati.  That is also known as Mr Jack, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3777"><a name="pos3777"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3778"><a name="pos3778"></a>ADV FORD:   Up to now, the only information you have given in so </p>
<p class="line" id="line3779"><a name="pos3779"></a>far as the other two, Mr Faku and Mr Mapipa is concerned, is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3780"><a name="pos3780"></a>initial conversation in the tea room, or am I wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3781"><a name="pos3781"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, they were also present during the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3782"><a name="pos3782"></a>operation where my source was eliminated and the other one was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3783"><a name="pos3783"></a>detained in Quatro.  The four of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3784"><a name="pos3784"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, you didn't need for of them to tell the ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line3785"><a name="pos3785"></a>about that, one of them could have done it just as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3786"><a name="pos3786"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is correct, but you asked me what the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3787"><a name="pos3787"></a>activities were and they also took some of my informers to the safe </p>
<p class="line" id="line3788"><a name="pos3788"></a>houses.  And they were also recruited for the ANC and Mgoduka </p>
<p class="line" id="line3789"><a name="pos3789"></a>was the principle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3790"><a name="pos3790"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you have specific information that they too had </p>
<p class="line" id="line3791"><a name="pos3791"></a>been recruited?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3792"><a name="pos3792"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is the information which I got from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3793"><a name="pos3793"></a>source.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3794"><a name="pos3794"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Mapipa had only been involved since 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3795"><a name="pos3795"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3796"><a name="pos3796"></a>ADV FORD:   But if I understand your evidence in so far as the safe </p>
<p class="line" id="line3797"><a name="pos3797"></a>houses are concerned, and the like, his knowledge would have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line3798"><a name="pos3798"></a>as good as the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3799"><a name="pos3799"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3800"><a name="pos3800"></a>ADV FORD:   Now, when  Colonel De Kock arrived, Mr Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line3801"><a name="pos3801"></a>Rensburg was still present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3802"><a name="pos3802"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3803"><a name="pos3803"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you go through the whole explanation from start </p>
<p class="line" id="line3804"><a name="pos3804"></a>to finish again or did you just deal with certain aspects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3805"><a name="pos3805"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I only explained to De Kock in what these </p>
<p class="line" id="line3806"><a name="pos3806"></a>people were involved and their roles in the operation and that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3807"><a name="pos3807"></a>were involved in the Goniwe matter.  As I said I can't remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line3808"><a name="pos3808"></a>exactly whether I at that stage when De Kock was there, whether I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3809"><a name="pos3809"></a>mentioned the fraud matter, that they were involved in the fraud or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3810"><a name="pos3810"></a>whether I mentioned that before De Kock arrived.  I can't remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line3811"><a name="pos3811"></a>that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3812"><a name="pos3812"></a>ADV FORD:   You see, as it was put to you by the Commissioner </p>
<p class="line" id="line3813"><a name="pos3813"></a>Potgieter earlier, the suggestion certainly seems to be that there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3814"><a name="pos3814"></a>a potential for Mgoduka, Faku and the others, to be prosecuted on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3815"><a name="pos3815"></a>charges of fraud and the reaction to that was to threaten to convey </p>
<p class="line" id="line3816"><a name="pos3816"></a>information to the ANC.  Did you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3817"><a name="pos3817"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Not all four of them, only two of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3818"><a name="pos3818"></a>ADV FORD:   Just two, Mgoduka and Sehati?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3819"><a name="pos3819"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3820"><a name="pos3820"></a>ADV FORD:   But if they had conveyed the information in regard to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3821"><a name="pos3821"></a>the Goniwe killings and in regard to the fraud itself, the taking of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3822"><a name="pos3822"></a>money intended for the ANC, nothing else was required.  Both </p>
<p class="line" id="line3823"><a name="pos3823"></a>operations would have been blown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3824"><a name="pos3824"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3825"><a name="pos3825"></a>ADV FORD:   And it was then vitally important that they be silenced </p>
<p class="line" id="line3826"><a name="pos3826"></a>for those aspects, would you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3827"><a name="pos3827"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It wasn't a primary factor to eliminate them </p>
<p class="line" id="line3828"><a name="pos3828"></a>regarding the fraud.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3829"><a name="pos3829"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, that is what  you say Mr Nieuwoudt.  I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line3830"><a name="pos3830"></a>suggesting to you that your evidence regarding the giving of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3831"><a name="pos3831"></a>information concerning safe houses, the identifying of informants </p>
<p class="line" id="line3832"><a name="pos3832"></a>and the like, is something which came afterwards.  The primary </p>
<p class="line" id="line3833"><a name="pos3833"></a>consideration was that the information relating to the Goniwe </p>
<p class="line" id="line3834"><a name="pos3834"></a>killings, should not be made public and the information regarding the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3835"><a name="pos3835"></a>taking of money from the ANC should not be made public?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3836"><a name="pos3836"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   The fraud was not a factor with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3837"><a name="pos3837"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Mr Nieuwoudt, we accept that the fraud was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3838"><a name="pos3838"></a>a factor, but if they were charged, they could have exposed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3839"><a name="pos3839"></a>whole network?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3840"><a name="pos3840"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3841"><a name="pos3841"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   And what the Advocate is putting to you is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3842"><a name="pos3842"></a>they were threatening to do just that.  If I understand it correctly, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3843"><a name="pos3843"></a>they virtually blackmailed you and said to you just you dare to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3844"><a name="pos3844"></a>prosecute me and I will expose everything, they were using that to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3845"><a name="pos3845"></a>stop you from prosecuting them for fraud.  If I may use an example, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3846"><a name="pos3846"></a>it is exactly what Nofamela did later on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3847"><a name="pos3847"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3848"><a name="pos3848"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   When he wasn't saved from the gallows, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line3849"><a name="pos3849"></a>revealed everything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3850"><a name="pos3850"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3851"><a name="pos3851"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Is that not what you feared?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3852"><a name="pos3852"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I did not see it like that at that stage, but it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3853"><a name="pos3853"></a>so that Gilbert could have considered that when he made his </p>
<p class="line" id="line3854"><a name="pos3854"></a>decision, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3855"><a name="pos3855"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Nieuwoudt, after the bombing you if one has </p>
<p class="line" id="line3856"><a name="pos3856"></a>regard to your evidence in the so-called Goniwe inquest, and other </p>
<p class="line" id="line3857"><a name="pos3857"></a>statements which you have made, and what you have told the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3858"><a name="pos3858"></a>Commission today, were present.  You were present on the scene </p>
<p class="line" id="line3859"><a name="pos3859"></a>together with Ras and Snyman.  And you planted the detonator as it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3860"><a name="pos3860"></a>were.  The detonator which you had previously prepared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3861"><a name="pos3861"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3862"><a name="pos3862"></a>ADV FORD:   What was the purpose of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3863"><a name="pos3863"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   To throw the other operatives off the scent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3864"><a name="pos3864"></a>ADV FORD:   I don't know if you will agree with this Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3865"><a name="pos3865"></a>Nieuwoudt, but on a perusal of your cross-examination in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3866"><a name="pos3866"></a>Goniwe inquest, would you agree that that detonator which you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3867"><a name="pos3867"></a>planted, could never have set off the explosives which were in fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line3868"><a name="pos3868"></a>set off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3869"><a name="pos3869"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   It may.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3870"><a name="pos3870"></a>ADV FORD:   So you believe it could still have been used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3871"><a name="pos3871"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3872"><a name="pos3872"></a>ADV FORD:   Now, being an explosives expert, you would expect I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3873"><a name="pos3873"></a>am sure that where a terrorist bomb had gone off, especially where </p>
<p class="line" id="line3874"><a name="pos3874"></a>members of the Security Forces are concerned, that at the very least, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3875"><a name="pos3875"></a>the matter would be fully investigated, a report obtained from an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3876"><a name="pos3876"></a>explosives expert, full attempt made to identify the explosives used, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3877"><a name="pos3877"></a>and the like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3878"><a name="pos3878"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3879"><a name="pos3879"></a>ADV FORD:   Now, you weren't personally involved in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3880"><a name="pos3880"></a>investigation of the bombing, were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3881"><a name="pos3881"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3882"><a name="pos3882"></a>ADV FORD:   The Investigating Officer as has already been said was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3883"><a name="pos3883"></a>one Captain Van Wyk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3884"><a name="pos3884"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3885"><a name="pos3885"></a>ADV FORD:   Under the authority or control of Colonel Roelofse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3886"><a name="pos3886"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3887"><a name="pos3887"></a>ADV FORD:   Did the investigation of bombings fall well within </p>
<p class="line" id="line3888"><a name="pos3888"></a>their powers or within their experience in this regard, do you think?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3889"><a name="pos3889"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.  Could I just explain that the bomb </p>
<p class="line" id="line3890"><a name="pos3890"></a>operatives would put in his statement his explanation and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3891"><a name="pos3891"></a>investigation could then proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3892"><a name="pos3892"></a>ADV FORD:   The investigation of this matter, do you know was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3893"><a name="pos3893"></a>video taken of the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3894"><a name="pos3894"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3895"><a name="pos3895"></a>ADV FORD:   Do you know when the video first came to light in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3896"><a name="pos3896"></a>course of the Goniwe inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3897"><a name="pos3897"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, it was whilst I was testifying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3898"><a name="pos3898"></a>ADV FORD:   Was there any mention of the video in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3899"><a name="pos3899"></a>investigating diary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3900"><a name="pos3900"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3901"><a name="pos3901"></a>ADV FORD:   You think so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3902"><a name="pos3902"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I think so because he was on the scene.  Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line3903"><a name="pos3903"></a>Wyk was himself on the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3904"><a name="pos3904"></a>ADV FORD:   A sketch plan came to light during the course of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3905"><a name="pos3905"></a>inquest, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3906"><a name="pos3906"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3907"><a name="pos3907"></a>ADV FORD:   Was there mention of that in the diary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3908"><a name="pos3908"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I think so because I think photographs were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3909"><a name="pos3909"></a>taken and on the video you can see where the fingerprint expert had </p>
<p class="line" id="line3910"><a name="pos3910"></a>taken certain measurements on the scene, so there must have been a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3911"><a name="pos3911"></a>plan and I think the Investigation Officer requested it as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3912"><a name="pos3912"></a>	But I think the person who dealt with that was Constable </p>
<p class="line" id="line3913"><a name="pos3913"></a>Retief, and he was then transferred.  I think that is where the matter </p>
<p class="line" id="line3914"><a name="pos3914"></a>ended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3915"><a name="pos3915"></a>ADV FORD:   Was there a report from an explosives expert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3916"><a name="pos3916"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3917"><a name="pos3917"></a>ADV FORD:   Who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3918"><a name="pos3918"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I handed in a report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3919"><a name="pos3919"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, that couldn't have been of much use, could it, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3920"><a name="pos3920"></a>seeing that you were involved in the placing of the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3921"><a name="pos3921"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3922"><a name="pos3922"></a>ADV FORD:   In that report, did you make any attempt to identify </p>
<p class="line" id="line3923"><a name="pos3923"></a>the explosives used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3924"><a name="pos3924"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3925"><a name="pos3925"></a>ADV FORD:   Did you make, was there any suggestion that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3926"><a name="pos3926"></a>conducted any investigations in so far as the identity of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3927"><a name="pos3927"></a>explosives were concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3928"><a name="pos3928"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3929"><a name="pos3929"></a>ADV FORD:   Were any specimens taken in an attempt to analyze </p>
<p class="line" id="line3930"><a name="pos3930"></a>these from the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3931"><a name="pos3931"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3932"><a name="pos3932"></a>ADV FORD:   In those circumstances, how was it ever going to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3933"><a name="pos3933"></a>possible to analyze the origins of the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3934"><a name="pos3934"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   We were all on the scene, all the operatives.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3935"><a name="pos3935"></a>We couldn't take any samples, because it was contaminated and in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3936"><a name="pos3936"></a>any event, you can't determine the origins of the explosive device.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3937"><a name="pos3937"></a>The samples would only tell you what it was made of normally, so </p>
<p class="line" id="line3938"><a name="pos3938"></a>there isn't any concrete ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3939"><a name="pos3939"></a>ADV FORD:   The point is I am making, Mr Nieuwoudt, there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3940"><a name="pos3940"></a>no real attempt made to do any of that, was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3941"><a name="pos3941"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3942"><a name="pos3942"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Bizos in his cross-examination of Colonel </p>
<p class="line" id="line3943"><a name="pos3943"></a>Roelofse in the Goniwe inquest, referred to it as a parody of an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3944"><a name="pos3944"></a>investigation.  Do you think he was wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3945"><a name="pos3945"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I don't think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3946"><a name="pos3946"></a>ADV FORD:   Have you read through the investigation diary of that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3947"><a name="pos3947"></a>incident, Mr Nieuwoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3948"><a name="pos3948"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3949"><a name="pos3949"></a>ADV FORD:   Do you know how many times the notation is made </p>
<p class="line" id="line3950"><a name="pos3950"></a>investigation proceeding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3951"><a name="pos3951"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   There were many of those, many of those </p>
<p class="line" id="line3952"><a name="pos3952"></a>notes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3953"><a name="pos3953"></a>ADV FORD:   In your experience as an officer, what is the purpose </p>
<p class="line" id="line3954"><a name="pos3954"></a>of an investigating diary?  To explain precisely what investigation is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3955"><a name="pos3955"></a>being conducted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3956"><a name="pos3956"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3957"><a name="pos3957"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, what kind of diary is this now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3958"><a name="pos3958"></a>ADV FORD:   The investigating diary which related specifically to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3959"><a name="pos3959"></a>the bombing, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3960"><a name="pos3960"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   In other words you did everything in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line3961"><a name="pos3961"></a>power, to actually cover this up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3962"><a name="pos3962"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3963"><a name="pos3963"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I think we can accept that Mr Ford.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3964"><a name="pos3964"></a>ADV FORD:   I certainly accept that this witness would have done </p>
<p class="line" id="line3965"><a name="pos3965"></a>that, I am trying to identify because if other persons were also </p>
<p class="line" id="line3966"><a name="pos3966"></a>involved in the cover up Mr Chairman, then it is appropriate and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3967"><a name="pos3967"></a>proper that they should also be brought to justice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3968"><a name="pos3968"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Proper that what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3969"><a name="pos3969"></a>ADV FORD:   That they also be brought to justice.  That is why I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3970"><a name="pos3970"></a>am asking these questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3971"><a name="pos3971"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   But you must remain within the parameters of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3972"><a name="pos3972"></a>this particular application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3973"><a name="pos3973"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Chairman, as I understand it, one of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3974"><a name="pos3974"></a>requirements of an applicant in one of these applications, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3975"><a name="pos3975"></a>there should be a full disclosure of facts.  If there are facts which </p>
<p class="line" id="line3976"><a name="pos3976"></a>are available to any of the applicants, which indicate that any other </p>
<p class="line" id="line3977"><a name="pos3977"></a>person committed a criminal act in relation to this incident, then </p>
<p class="line" id="line3978"><a name="pos3978"></a>those facts too should be brought to light.  If I am wrong, then I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3979"><a name="pos3979"></a>will desist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3980"><a name="pos3980"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   No, you are wrong.  The Act does not say a full </p>
<p class="line" id="line3981"><a name="pos3981"></a>disclosure of all the facts, it says a full disclosure of all the relevant </p>
<p class="line" id="line3982"><a name="pos3982"></a>facts.  The word relevant is there, it is used there with a very good </p>
<p class="line" id="line3983"><a name="pos3983"></a>purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3984"><a name="pos3984"></a>ADV FORD:   Yes, Mr Chairman.  Am I to understand then that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3985"><a name="pos3985"></a>facts relevant to the cover up which took place afterwards, are not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3986"><a name="pos3986"></a>relevant?  Because if that is so, then I will stop, then I am wasting </p>
<p class="line" id="line3987"><a name="pos3987"></a>... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3988"><a name="pos3988"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the cover up must be relevant first.  What </p>
<p class="line" id="line3989"><a name="pos3989"></a>do you want to bring first?  We shouldn't argue about what came </p>
<p class="line" id="line3990"><a name="pos3990"></a>first, the chicken or the egg or what should come first.  The cover </p>
<p class="line" id="line3991"><a name="pos3991"></a>up in the sense that you want to canvass it, must be relevant before </p>
<p class="line" id="line3992"><a name="pos3992"></a>the non-disclosure thereof can be said to be material and that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3993"><a name="pos3993"></a>should have been disclosed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3994"><a name="pos3994"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Chairman, I am trying to ascertain whether there </p>
<p class="line" id="line3995"><a name="pos3995"></a>were any other members of the Security Police in Port Elizabeth, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3996"><a name="pos3996"></a>especially those in higher office, who were well aware of what had </p>
<p class="line" id="line3997"><a name="pos3997"></a>happened, the operation which took place, and were involved in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3998"><a name="pos3998"></a>cover up which took place afterwards.  I am trying to do no more </p>
<p class="line" id="line3999"><a name="pos3999"></a>than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4000"><a name="pos4000"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well, yes, but don't go beyond the limits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4001"><a name="pos4001"></a>ADV FORD:   I will certainly desist if you tell me I am so doing Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line4002"><a name="pos4002"></a>Chairman, I will stop it immediately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4003"><a name="pos4003"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I am just about to think that you are just about at </p>
<p class="line" id="line4004"><a name="pos4004"></a>the limit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4005"><a name="pos4005"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, may I ask one or two more questions Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line4006"><a name="pos4006"></a>Chairman?  Mr Nieuwoudt, having regard to the positions in which </p>
<p class="line" id="line4007"><a name="pos4007"></a>both Colonel Roelofse and Captain Van Wyk held in the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line4008"><a name="pos4008"></a>Branch, your evidence as I understand it is that they had no </p>
<p class="line" id="line4009"><a name="pos4009"></a>knowledge of the operation either before or after?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4010"><a name="pos4010"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4011"><a name="pos4011"></a>ADV FORD:   And as far as you are concerned, nothing relating to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4012"><a name="pos4012"></a>the investigation thereafter in any way changes your view in that </p>
<p class="line" id="line4013"><a name="pos4013"></a>regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4014"><a name="pos4014"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.  I may mention that I misled </p>
<p class="line" id="line4015"><a name="pos4015"></a>the people at the scene by placing that detonator there and even my </p>
<p class="line" id="line4016"><a name="pos4016"></a>experts were misled.  They made the assumption that it was an ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line4017"><a name="pos4017"></a>operation.  So I misled them, but nobody else knew about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4018"><a name="pos4018"></a>ADV FORD:   Let me only put this to you then Mr Nieuwoudt, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4019"><a name="pos4019"></a>documentation available, documentation which was referred to in </p>
<p class="line" id="line4020"><a name="pos4020"></a>your trial, the reports referred to a limpet mine, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4021"><a name="pos4021"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Not in my statement.  That is the statement </p>
<p class="line" id="line4022"><a name="pos4022"></a>which the Magistrate made.  Somebody used that terminology and </p>
<p class="line" id="line4023"><a name="pos4023"></a>also explained it like that to the Doctor.  That is why Advocate </p>
<p class="line" id="line4024"><a name="pos4024"></a>Mostert told me that I had misled them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4025"><a name="pos4025"></a>	Well, I did mislead them initially on the scene and because I </p>
<p class="line" id="line4026"><a name="pos4026"></a>had left a limpet mine detonator there, they made the assumption.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line4027"><a name="pos4027"></a>The Magistrate and the Doctor and the person who had issued the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4028"><a name="pos4028"></a>press statement.  The policeman who released the press statement, </p>
<p class="line" id="line4029"><a name="pos4029"></a>all made mention of a limpet mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4030"><a name="pos4030"></a>ADV FORD:   The report which was forwarded under your signature </p>
<p class="line" id="line4031"><a name="pos4031"></a>to Pretoria, if my recollection is right, also made mention of a limpet </p>
<p class="line" id="line4032"><a name="pos4032"></a>mine, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4033"><a name="pos4033"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was an administrative report relating to a </p>
<p class="line" id="line4034"><a name="pos4034"></a>damaged vehicle and I simply signed the post.  I didn't even read the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4035"><a name="pos4035"></a>contents.  It was simply to comply with the requirements of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4036"><a name="pos4036"></a>quartermaster regarding a damaged vehicle and somebody else </p>
<p class="line" id="line4037"><a name="pos4037"></a>drafted the report, I was the Unit Commander and I simply signed it </p>
<p class="line" id="line4038"><a name="pos4038"></a>without reading it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4039"><a name="pos4039"></a>ADV FORD:   Would you agree with me Mr Nieuwoudt, that by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4040"><a name="pos4040"></a>end of the evidence in this regard, it was quite clear that the bomb in </p>
<p class="line" id="line4041"><a name="pos4041"></a>question could not have been a limpet mine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4042"><a name="pos4042"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4043"><a name="pos4043"></a>ADV FORD:   And had a proper investigation been conducted, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line4044"><a name="pos4044"></a>could have been ascertained by an explosives expert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4045"><a name="pos4045"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4046"><a name="pos4046"></a>ADV FORD:   Well, let me take it, you weren't a professional, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line4047"><a name="pos4047"></a>have already told us that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4048"><a name="pos4048"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct, but you could not from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4049"><a name="pos4049"></a>scene there, you wouldn't be able to determine what kind of </p>
<p class="line" id="line4050"><a name="pos4050"></a>explosive device had been used.  Nobody would be able to determine </p>
<p class="line" id="line4051"><a name="pos4051"></a>that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4052"><a name="pos4052"></a>ADV FORD:   The proper people to conduct the investigation and to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4053"><a name="pos4053"></a>furnish such a report, would have been those who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line4054"><a name="pos4054"></a>professionals, would you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4055"><a name="pos4055"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Even the forensic laboratory will not be able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4056"><a name="pos4056"></a>tell you how big the charge had been, what type of charge had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line4057"><a name="pos4057"></a>used.  They would only be able to tell you what kind of elements had </p>
<p class="line" id="line4058"><a name="pos4058"></a>been used in the manufacture of the explosives.  That would be all </p>
<p class="line" id="line4059"><a name="pos4059"></a>that they could tell you.  They wouldn't be able to tell you how big </p>
<p class="line" id="line4060"><a name="pos4060"></a>it had been, what kind it had been etc.  Only the type of explosive </p>
<p class="line" id="line4061"><a name="pos4061"></a>used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4062"><a name="pos4062"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Nieuwoudt, out of the literature which you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line4063"><a name="pos4063"></a>read and which you've told this Commission you have read, would </p>
<p class="line" id="line4064"><a name="pos4064"></a>you agree with me that it is everybody agrees, in as far as the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4065"><a name="pos4065"></a>literature is concerned, that in so far as counter-insurgency, </p>
<p class="line" id="line4066"><a name="pos4066"></a>counter-intelligence is concerned, the elimination of people is an </p>
<p class="line" id="line4067"><a name="pos4067"></a>absolute final resort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4068"><a name="pos4068"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4069"><a name="pos4069"></a>ADV FORD:   And that if there are any other ways of - was there </p>
<p class="line" id="line4070"><a name="pos4070"></a>any way of avoiding killing people, it should be done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4071"><a name="pos4071"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4072"><a name="pos4072"></a>ADV FORD:   What I am putting to you Mr Nieuwoudt, that even if </p>
<p class="line" id="line4073"><a name="pos4073"></a>all your other evidence with regard to the involvement of Mgoduka, </p>
<p class="line" id="line4074"><a name="pos4074"></a>Sehati, Mapipa and Faku is correct, that there were other ways.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4075"><a name="pos4075"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I repeat what I said, I left it in Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line4076"><a name="pos4076"></a>Gilbert's hands, he gave me the order.  He made the decision.   It </p>
<p class="line" id="line4077"><a name="pos4077"></a>wasn't necessary for me as far as I was concerned, it wasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line4078"><a name="pos4078"></a>necessary to eliminate them, but that was my order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4079"><a name="pos4079"></a>ADV FORD:   Mr Chairman, if I may just have a moment.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line4080"><a name="pos4080"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Before you resume.  I think we should admit this </p>
<p class="line" id="line4081"><a name="pos4081"></a>as Exhibit B.  I don't think we did, did we, the requisition for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4082"><a name="pos4082"></a>tickets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4083"><a name="pos4083"></a>MR BRINK:   The voucher for the plane ticket, yes it is before you. </p>
<p class="line" id="line4084"><a name="pos4084"></a> Exhibit B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4085"><a name="pos4085"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   The voucher for the ticket is then Exhibit B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4086"><a name="pos4086"></a>ADV FORD:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Finally Mr Nieuwoudt, </p>
<p class="line" id="line4087"><a name="pos4087"></a>would it be fair to put to you that had you not conveyed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4088"><a name="pos4088"></a>information which you did, to Brigadier Gilbert, if you hadn't urged </p>
<p class="line" id="line4089"><a name="pos4089"></a>upon him the urgency and the importance of the situation, and how </p>
<p class="line" id="line4090"><a name="pos4090"></a>complicated it was, and urged upon him that drastic steps were </p>
<p class="line" id="line4091"><a name="pos4091"></a>required, the men would not have been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4092"><a name="pos4092"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I had my information which I believed was </p>
<p class="line" id="line4093"><a name="pos4093"></a>correct, that I conveyed to him.  I gave him a full report, he listened </p>
<p class="line" id="line4094"><a name="pos4094"></a>to the tapes himself and he made that decision that those persons </p>
<p class="line" id="line4095"><a name="pos4095"></a>should be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4096"><a name="pos4096"></a>ADV FORD:   Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4097"><a name="pos4097"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV FORD.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4098"><a name="pos4098"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   That order was to commit an offence.  Do you </p>
<p class="line" id="line4099"><a name="pos4099"></a>agree with Mr Van Rensburg's evidence that a member had a choice </p>
<p class="line" id="line4100"><a name="pos4100"></a>in the sense that if you didn't want to obey a so-called order to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4101"><a name="pos4101"></a>commit an offence, then you could refuse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4102"><a name="pos4102"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, not in the culture which I found myself, </p>
<p class="line" id="line4103"><a name="pos4103"></a>one did not question one's superiors.  I was indoctrinated and told </p>
<p class="line" id="line4104"><a name="pos4104"></a>that we had to fight the ANC as the enemy, so the order which I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line4105"><a name="pos4105"></a>given, I trusted implicitly and obeyed implicitly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4106"><a name="pos4106"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Was Mr Van Rensburg wrong when he said </p>
<p class="line" id="line4107"><a name="pos4107"></a>that a member in those circumstances had a choice.  That was his </p>
<p class="line" id="line4108"><a name="pos4108"></a>very clear evidence yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4109"><a name="pos4109"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I can only speculate.  I don't know what </p>
<p class="line" id="line4110"><a name="pos4110"></a>General Van Rensburg meant, but the way I interpreted it was that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line4111"><a name="pos4111"></a>never questioned an order given by a superior.  I followed it blindly </p>
<p class="line" id="line4112"><a name="pos4112"></a>and that is why I am in these circumstances, because I was loyal to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4113"><a name="pos4113"></a>my Security Branch and towards my Commanding Officer and to my </p>
<p class="line" id="line4114"><a name="pos4114"></a>country.  That is why I did this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4115"><a name="pos4115"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4116"><a name="pos4116"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Brink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4117"><a name="pos4117"></a>MR BRINK:   Just one question Mr Chairman.  Mr Nieuwoudt I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line4118"><a name="pos4118"></a>referring to the so-called funeral and wedding letters, you know </p>
<p class="line" id="line4119"><a name="pos4119"></a>what I am talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4120"><a name="pos4120"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4121"><a name="pos4121"></a>MR BRINK:   In what language or languages were they written, can </p>
<p class="line" id="line4122"><a name="pos4122"></a>you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4123"><a name="pos4123"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That was written in English and also in Xhosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4124"><a name="pos4124"></a>MR BRINK:   Did you have apart from the four people who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line4125"><a name="pos4125"></a>killed, did you have other Xhosa speaking people on your staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4126"><a name="pos4126"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4127"><a name="pos4127"></a>MR BRINK:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4128"><a name="pos4128"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Mr Nieuwoudt, you might be able to help me </p>
<p class="line" id="line4129"><a name="pos4129"></a>with one aspect,  Snyman and Vermeulen and Ras, were they </p>
<p class="line" id="line4130"><a name="pos4130"></a>Warrant Officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4131"><a name="pos4131"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4132"><a name="pos4132"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   All three of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4133"><a name="pos4133"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.  If I remember correctly at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4134"><a name="pos4134"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Did you not trust them completely or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4135"><a name="pos4135"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I trusted them completely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4136"><a name="pos4136"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   You didn't tell them about the Eastern Block </p>
<p class="line" id="line4137"><a name="pos4137"></a>detonator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4138"><a name="pos4138"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.  I deposited it there without being noticed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4139"><a name="pos4139"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Did you tell anybody else about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4140"><a name="pos4140"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4141"><a name="pos4141"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   You didn't tell Gilbert or anyone else?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line4142"><a name="pos4142"></a>Perhaps the two experts, Du Toit and Kok?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4143"><a name="pos4143"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4144"><a name="pos4144"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4145"><a name="pos4145"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Because Gilbert had told me that it should </p>
<p class="line" id="line4146"><a name="pos4146"></a>look, made to look like an ANC operation and I knew that on </p>
<p class="line" id="line4147"><a name="pos4147"></a>several such scenes we had picked up some of these detonators and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line4148"><a name="pos4148"></a>knew that if it had been done by the technical division, then there </p>
<p class="line" id="line4149"><a name="pos4149"></a>would be no proof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4150"><a name="pos4150"></a>	And that is why I left that detonator there to point a finger at </p>
<p class="line" id="line4151"><a name="pos4151"></a>the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4152"><a name="pos4152"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But didn't you think of asking Du Toit and </p>
<p class="line" id="line4153"><a name="pos4153"></a>Kok, why didn't you ask them look if I plant this thing on the scene, </p>
<p class="line" id="line4154"><a name="pos4154"></a>would it lead to any problems?  Another expert perhaps, could be </p>
<p class="line" id="line4155"><a name="pos4155"></a>able to work out that this was a planted detonator. </p>
<p class="line" id="line4156"><a name="pos4156"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4157"><a name="pos4157"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   That that detonator couldn't or wasn't able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4158"><a name="pos4158"></a>detonate this charge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4159"><a name="pos4159"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, but it could.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4160"><a name="pos4160"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Yes, that is your opinion.  But you didn't think </p>
<p class="line" id="line4161"><a name="pos4161"></a>of asking anybody about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4162"><a name="pos4162"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4163"><a name="pos4163"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   And the other aspect, you took a detour with </p>
<p class="line" id="line4164"><a name="pos4164"></a>Snyman, Ras and Vermeulen.  You drove to the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4165"><a name="pos4165"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is when we loaded the vehicle with </p>
<p class="line" id="line4166"><a name="pos4166"></a>explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4167"><a name="pos4167"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Yes, on page 336 of the record and you say on </p>
<p class="line" id="line4168"><a name="pos4168"></a>the last line of paragraph 40 you say I took these people with a </p>
<p class="line" id="line4169"><a name="pos4169"></a>detour to the scene so that they couldn't later be able to identify the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4170"><a name="pos4170"></a>premises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4171"><a name="pos4171"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4172"><a name="pos4172"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Why did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4173"><a name="pos4173"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I acted pro-actively to ensure that there would </p>
<p class="line" id="line4174"><a name="pos4174"></a>be the necessary compartmentalisation and that we operated on a </p>
<p class="line" id="line4175"><a name="pos4175"></a>need to know basis in case of future cases testimony.  In case any </p>
<p class="line" id="line4176"><a name="pos4176"></a>one of those people had to testify in future cases, they wouldn't be </p>
<p class="line" id="line4177"><a name="pos4177"></a>able to identify the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4178"><a name="pos4178"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But they knew what was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4179"><a name="pos4179"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4180"><a name="pos4180"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   They would then carry out plan B, or at least </p>
<p class="line" id="line4181"><a name="pos4181"></a>two of them would?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4182"><a name="pos4182"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4183"><a name="pos4183"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Is that also a decision which you took on your </p>
<p class="line" id="line4184"><a name="pos4184"></a>own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4185"><a name="pos4185"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that was one of my security measures </p>
<p class="line" id="line4186"><a name="pos4186"></a>which I put in place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4187"><a name="pos4187"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   So in fact you put plan C into operation as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4188"><a name="pos4188"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Just in case the people who was supposed to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4189"><a name="pos4189"></a>carry out plan B, decided to change their minds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4190"><a name="pos4190"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4191"><a name="pos4191"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   And decided that they would rather tell the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4192"><a name="pos4192"></a>truth, then at least they wouldn't be able to identify this place?  Is </p>
<p class="line" id="line4193"><a name="pos4193"></a>that how you tried to guarantee the success of the venture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4194"><a name="pos4194"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Those are precautions which I took.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4195"><a name="pos4195"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Was that because they were subordinates?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4196"><a name="pos4196"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4197"><a name="pos4197"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   You couldn't always be hundred percent </p>
<p class="line" id="line4198"><a name="pos4198"></a>certain that there would be no problems in future once the questions </p>
<p class="line" id="line4199"><a name="pos4199"></a>start to be asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4200"><a name="pos4200"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4201"><a name="pos4201"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4202"><a name="pos4202"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4203"><a name="pos4203"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   When Gilbert suggested that these people should </p>
<p class="line" id="line4204"><a name="pos4204"></a>be transferred, you didn't think that would solve the problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4205"><a name="pos4205"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I didn't think that it would solve the problem.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line4206"><a name="pos4206"></a>I immediately thought that they would abscond.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4207"><a name="pos4207"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   What did you think would solve the problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4208"><a name="pos4208"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   If I think back now I don't know what I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line4209"><a name="pos4209"></a>say, but then I left it in his hands, I didn't think about it.  I didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line4210"><a name="pos4210"></a>think what could solve the problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4211"><a name="pos4211"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You see, you and Gilbert were it seems to me, in </p>
<p class="line" id="line4212"><a name="pos4212"></a>good terms and I get the impression that he was actually open to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4213"><a name="pos4213"></a>suggestions from you.  He was quite prepared to discuss this issue </p>
<p class="line" id="line4214"><a name="pos4214"></a>with you and I would like to know why you wouldn't have, if you </p>
<p class="line" id="line4215"><a name="pos4215"></a>were not happy with the transfer, in the course of this discussions </p>
<p class="line" id="line4216"><a name="pos4216"></a>with him, why you didn't put your mind to use and come up with </p>
<p class="line" id="line4217"><a name="pos4217"></a>some other suggestions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4218"><a name="pos4218"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   If I think back to the events, he didn't ask me </p>
<p class="line" id="line4219"><a name="pos4219"></a>for suggestions or comment or anything like that.  I simply told him </p>
<p class="line" id="line4220"><a name="pos4220"></a>what I feared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4221"><a name="pos4221"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but he didn't have to ask you for an </p>
<p class="line" id="line4222"><a name="pos4222"></a>alternative suggestions, I mean he is putting across his suggestion.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line4223"><a name="pos4223"></a>His own suggestion and if you are not happy with it, surely he didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line4224"><a name="pos4224"></a>have to ask you for your own input.  The whole purpose of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line4225"><a name="pos4225"></a>being there with him, was precisely to discuss the problem and to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4226"><a name="pos4226"></a>come up with a solution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4227"><a name="pos4227"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I merely gave him the information which I </p>
<p class="line" id="line4228"><a name="pos4228"></a>had and I sketched the consequences which could arise.  And then I </p>
<p class="line" id="line4229"><a name="pos4229"></a>left the decision to him, with all respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4230"><a name="pos4230"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is the impression not correct as conveyed by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4231"><a name="pos4231"></a>uncorrected version of your affidavit, that you came up with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4232"><a name="pos4232"></a>suggestion that they should be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4233"><a name="pos4233"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I had never at any stage considered that </p>
<p class="line" id="line4234"><a name="pos4234"></a>they should be eliminated.  I had no action against them as far as </p>
<p class="line" id="line4235"><a name="pos4235"></a>that was concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4236"><a name="pos4236"></a>CHAIRPERSON:    So while Gilbert suggested one solution namely </p>
<p class="line" id="line4237"><a name="pos4237"></a>that they be transferred, as far as you are concerned, you just didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line4238"><a name="pos4238"></a>have any other solution, any alternative solution.  Your mind just </p>
<p class="line" id="line4239"><a name="pos4239"></a>didn't come up with anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4240"><a name="pos4240"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.  The only thing I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line4241"><a name="pos4241"></a>concerned about was that should they be transferred, it could just </p>
<p class="line" id="line4242"><a name="pos4242"></a>exaggerate the problem and that they could abscond and that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line4243"><a name="pos4243"></a>would still be in a position to expose our whole Security Network.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line4244"><a name="pos4244"></a>My security lines would have been cut off  because they were my </p>
<p class="line" id="line4245"><a name="pos4245"></a>eyes and ears.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4246"><a name="pos4246"></a>	And that is why they were of crucial importance for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4247"><a name="pos4247"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Perhaps I should also ask you this.  Why didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line4248"><a name="pos4248"></a>you take these people, detained them, assaulted them and tortured </p>
<p class="line" id="line4249"><a name="pos4249"></a>them as you used to do in the past, extracting information and </p>
<p class="line" id="line4250"><a name="pos4250"></a>admissions from them?  I mean you used to do that, the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line4251"><a name="pos4251"></a>Police used to do that in the past?  We know now, you used to deny </p>
<p class="line" id="line4252"><a name="pos4252"></a>it, but now you don't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4253"><a name="pos4253"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4254"><a name="pos4254"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Why didn't you get them in, detain them, assault </p>
<p class="line" id="line4255"><a name="pos4255"></a>them and torture them, put big tubes in their faces, suffocate them </p>
<p class="line" id="line4256"><a name="pos4256"></a>like it used to happen until they brought all this information as </p>
<p class="line" id="line4257"><a name="pos4257"></a>opposed to killing them.  Why didn't you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4258"><a name="pos4258"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   That is so.  But I repeat we were there to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4259"><a name="pos4259"></a>prevent that the information be leaked.  And I left the decision in </p>
<p class="line" id="line4260"><a name="pos4260"></a>Gilbert's hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4261"><a name="pos4261"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   But I can assure you if you had tortured them the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4262"><a name="pos4262"></a>way that we know people used to be tortured, I am not so sure that </p>
<p class="line" id="line4263"><a name="pos4263"></a>they would ever have dared to leak, take out any other information. </p>
<p class="line" id="line4264"><a name="pos4264"></a> They would have been in serious trouble?  That could have solved </p>
<p class="line" id="line4265"><a name="pos4265"></a>the problem maybe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4266"><a name="pos4266"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Maybe, it is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4267"><a name="pos4267"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Why didn't you think of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4268"><a name="pos4268"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   I did not at that stage, with all respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4269"><a name="pos4269"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I hear you, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4270"><a name="pos4270"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Just a follow up question.  You never at any </p>
<p class="line" id="line4271"><a name="pos4271"></a>stage formed the opinion that the only solution in the circumstances </p>
<p class="line" id="line4272"><a name="pos4272"></a>was to eliminate the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4273"><a name="pos4273"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   No, I didn't.  I never formed that opinion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4274"><a name="pos4274"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   You didn't see that as the only way out, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line4275"><a name="pos4275"></a>only way to deal with the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4276"><a name="pos4276"></a>MR NIEUWOUDT:   Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4277"><a name="pos4277"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4278"><a name="pos4278"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Booyens, re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4279"><a name="pos4279"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   I have got no re-examination Mr Chairman.</p>
