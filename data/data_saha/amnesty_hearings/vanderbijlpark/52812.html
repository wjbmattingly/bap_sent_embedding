<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson the next witness I intend calling is Jack Mbele, application no 6119/97.  I'm not gonna be too long with this witness, we ran a bit late ...(inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	... (inaudible) witness to be in the witness box if he's not going to be finished with during the session.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well unfortunately I don't think it's possible at this stage to give any undertaking in regard to how long the cross-examination is going to be.  So as to give you guarantee we will be finished with this witness by the - you know, by the time we adjourn tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson what - from our side ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Did you want to ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson all I wanted to say was from our side we will try our utmost to finish with Mr Mbele by tomorrow, and it is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will not hold you onto your    undertaking.  Yes Mr Strydom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson if there's a possibility that the witness cannot finish I would submit with respect, that would be unfair to bring this witness back whilst under cross-examination, only in January.  I would suggest, and that's only a suggestion, obviously the final decision is in your hands Mr Chairman, but that I lead the witness in chief and maybe then to end the proceedings at that stage.  That's just a suggestion I want to make.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) as it is practically possible.  You've got to understand Mr Strydom, there's still a number of applicants that we've got to go through, so we will have to utilise every possible time that we have at our disposal.  You know, you have the willingness on the part of counsel of the other side that every endeavour will be made to finish.  Let's proceed, and shall we see how far we go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, I'm calling Jack Mbele then to testify, if he can just be sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">JACK MBELE:</span> (duly sworn in, states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Mbele in front of you on page 119 of the bundle you'll find your amnesty application.  Op page 121 you'll see a signature, is that your signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes that is my signature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And do you confirm that you signed that application on the 26th of January 1989 at Koppies Police Station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Just for the record it's 1998.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Ja, thank you.  And do you confirm the contents of the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> According to the application you were born in Sharpeville, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you move to the kwaMadala Hostel at a certain stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> In October of 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During 1992 were you a member of the Inkatha Freedom Party or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you become a member of the Inkatha Freedom Party after you moved into the hostel, or before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> After I moved in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On page 122 and 123 of the documents before you certain answers are provided to certain questions contained in the amnesty application.  Do you confirm the correctness of the answers given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes I confirm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On page 124 you will find a request for further particulars, particulars asked by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and you'll find the answers on page 126 to page 128.  Do you confirm the correctness of the answers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes I confirm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Have the answers been canvassed with you again and do you still stand by the correctness thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Whilst we at page 128 you make mention of a person with the name of Makuka, who is this Makuka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> It's a friend of mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did he also stay in the kwaMadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was he also part of the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You stated in answer to the question no 6, your reply on page 128</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>"I remember seeing a person with the name of Makuka shoot a lady with a 9mm pistol.  I saw that she was hit and fell to the ground."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>Do you know approximately where in Boipatong did this incident take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I think it was in the settlement area in Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In your affidavit on page 129 and 130 you state that you partook in the attack, did you also go to Slovo Park or the informal settlement section of Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> We formed ourselves in a small group, I think 9 in number and we went into Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now before I can ask you about details about what happened at Slovo Park, I just want you to confirm you signature on page 130 of your affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That's my signature Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Has this affidavit been canvassed with you again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes it was canvassed again.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>MR STRYDOM:   You pointed out one mistake, I just want to refer you to that.  On top of page 130 it is stated:  "Ongeveer 'n week voor die 17de Junie 1992 was ek by 'n vergadering waar Mkhize gese het dat 'n aanval op Boipatong 'n moontlikheid was."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>Did Mr Mkhize mention Boipatong at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So the reference there to Boipatong, would that be correct or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> It's incorrect the name Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On that same page just a little bit lower down it reads</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>"Eers op die 17de Junie 1992 toe ek by die stadion kom het ek gehoor 'n aanval op Boipatong gaan nou plaasvind."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Before you moved to kwaMadala Hostel, were you shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who shot you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I don't want to commit myself, I don't know, but it was the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want to ask you more about the attack on Boipatong itself.  When you entered Boipatong, were you in a specific group or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You know who was leading this group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now you testified a little bit earlier on that you broke up into a smaller group, I think you mentioned 9 people, do you still remember the names of the people who formed that group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I remember Makuka, Simon, Gose, and other men from the hostel.  I just knew them by seeing them, I didn't know their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What weapon did you have with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> 9mm.</p>

<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was it a licensed firearm or not?</p>

<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you use that firearm in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know if you killed any person by using that firearm in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I would not say that there is a person that I killed, but I shot at people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you go into any houses in Boipatong?</p>

<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can you just slow down a little bit Mr Strydom, I'm just struggling to keep up with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS SIGODI:</span> Sorry Mr Strydom I didn't get it, the last answer, did he say did he break any windows?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> His answer was no, I'll just repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>	Did you break windows of - personally you, did you personally break windows of any houses at Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>

<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> More or less where in Boipatong were you when you fired those shots on people you didn't know if you hit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I was in the informal settlement and in the firms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If you say in the firms, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I'm referring to in the vicinity of the firms next to the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Apart from the shots you fired, did you hear other people firing shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see that other people fired shots?</p>

<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The leader of your group, Damarra Chonco, did you see that he fired shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I saw him shooting, but it was in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> With what kind of weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> 1847.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know an person by the Andries Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> An affidavit was handed to us, which purports to be an affidavit of Andries Nosenga, and I want to read a certain portion to you, and I want a comment.  I refer to Exhibit ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Mr Strydom, we haven't given it a number yet as far as I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It will probably only handed in formally at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.  I will just read paragraph 4 of this document to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>"When we got out of the hostel onto the road, we were picked up by a police Casspir driven by a white man whose name I don't know.  In the hippo there was Shaga of the security branch;  a white policeman known to me as Rooikop who had red hair;  Peens and our driver.  There were 14 or 15 IFP members inside the hippo.  Others were walking alongside.  Those that I remember who were in the hippo were, Katene, who had ordered us to get into the hippo;  Reuben, Themba, Lucky, Makuka, and Dondo."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>Now the question I want to ask you is this reference of the name Dondo, are you also known as Dondo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On the night of the 17th of June 1992 did you get into any hippo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know a person with the name of Shaga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Where do you know him from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> He's a policeman, I knew as we were being arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Have you been arrested by Shaga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Has he arrested other people you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know a white policeman known as Rooikop?</p>

<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I knew him from Flora Garden.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is Flora Garden the name of the Murder and Robbery Squad Unit in Vanderbijlpark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Howcome that you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Chairperson there was a little technical problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The question is, from where or how did it come about that you know Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> We were once arrested on our arrival at Flora Gardens.  The people who knew him told me his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Apart from the fact that he was the policeman who arrested people, did you have any dealings with him in the sense that you worked with him, if I can put it that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> According to you, on the night of the 17th of June 1992, was the police part of this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> The police were not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see any white people with or without balaclavas present at any stage during the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I never saw white people at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you thing of any reason why you would protect police or white people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No reason Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> This person I've mentioned earlier on, Andries Nosenga, do you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Maybe I know him facially, but I do not know him when you refer to him by that name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If I give you the further information, would you be able to state if you know him?  According to this document he's 23 years old, and is in prison presently serving a sentence of 16 years for murder at Maximum B Prison in Leeuwhof.  He was convicted in February 1995.  Do you have any knowledge of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Maybe you're referring to Matanzema, yes I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now this person Matanzema, did you see him on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After the attack, when you got back to the hostel, did you first go to the stadium or directly to your room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I went straight to my room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On the following day did you see that certain goods that came from Boipatong was burned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes, that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you assist in that process?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know who ordered the burning of the goods?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I do not know who ordered the burning of the goods.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What was the reason why you decided to go with the group to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I did not live happily.  If I wanted to go to Vereeniging or Vanderbijlpark, people were to be taken out of the taxis and be burned.  When we were walking in Sharpeville, we would be chased after.  Our lives were not nice at all.  The people of Boipatong were always blocking us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> According to you, who gave the instruction to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I would say the people who lived there, and the reason being that the people harassed us and we were dying, and nothing was happening.  The police did not even take care.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Ja, but the question is, who gave the instruction to attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Mr Strydom, he thinks you're saying who gave the instruction to attack him and his fellow inmates, that's why he's given that answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who gave the instruction to attack Boipatong - the question is who gave the instruction to the residents of kwaMadala to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I would say it's Damarra.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I've got no further questions at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STRYDOM</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, will you be - who's going to start that side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm going to start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would it be convenient if we take about 15 minutes break?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That will be convenient yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will take a 15 minute break and come back at 16h10.</p>

<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I remind you that you are still under oath to speak the truth.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">JACK MBELE:</span> (s.u.o)</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  	Mr Mbele you said that you could think of no reason why you would want to protect the police or why you would want to protect the whites involved in the attack on Boipatong.  Do you know of two policemen by the name of, one was called Monare and the other policeman was Xaba, X-A-B-A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I do not know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well I can tell you that they gave evidence in which they implicated the police and they have both since been killed.  My instructions are that they gave evidence during the Goldstone Commission hearing into the events at Boipatong, do you have any knowledge of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You gave evidence that you were shot by the comrades.  Is it correct that you went to hospital after this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you were in hospital, did you have a bullet removed from your left thigh?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I was referring to the right leg, not the left leg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you ever have a bullet removed from your left thigh?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I think it was around 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How many times have you been in hospital to have bullets removed from your legs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Three times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When was the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> It was in 1991 when I was fighting with the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the second time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> It was the same year, 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the third time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That was when I got injured after the Boipatong incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was that shortly after the Boipatong incident that you were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, during your criminal trial you were asked at page 3393 - you were accused 64 were you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The Court asked you, at line 19</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>"Ek het vanoggend verstaan u is tweekeer geskiet?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>Your answer was yes.  You were then asked:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>"Die eerste keer, in watter been is u geskiet?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>Your answer, the left.  You were asked then:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>"Die tweede keer?"  ---  You said:  "Die regterbeen."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>You were then asked by the Court, when were you in hospital for the second time, and your answer was in 1993, "... ek is nie seker van die datum nie."</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>	Now let me just get to the point, when you were in hospital the first time when you were shot in the left leg, that was on the 17th of August 1992.  On that day a bullet was removed from your left thigh.  So what I want to put to you is that the attacks that you are talking about took place after the attack on Boipatong, and not before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I agree with you when you say - yes, the left leg was shot after the Boipatong incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the right thigh was shot even later, according to your evidence at the criminal trial in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I was shot twice on the right leg in 1991 and yet the other time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you just repeat the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I say I was shot twice on the right leg, I was first shot before the incident of Boipatong, and I was shot another time after the incident, which was in 1993, that Mr Berger has referred to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that on your right leg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At your criminal trial, how many times did you say you had been shot, twice or three times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I do not remember how many times did I say I was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You mentioned that you were arrested once by Sergeant Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> He did not arrest me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He was there when you were arrested, what were you arrested for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> We were - it was being alleged that we were the hit-squad from kwaMadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it correct that you were involved in criminal activities in the Sharpeville area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you friendly with a person by the name of Dennis Mofokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you and he were involved in criminal activities in Sharpeville.  As a result of that you fled to kwaMadala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I knew Dennis after I went to kwaMadala, and from then onwards he became my friend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you and Dennis accused of being involved in hit-squads operating from kwaMadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Dennis was not involved, I was the only one being accused of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say that you never entered any houses and you never killed any people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> According to the evidence of Mr Bujose, you entered a house on the corner of Shlube and Bafokeng Street.  Would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> According to Mr Maloi who was a state witness, you and others were seen coming out of a house with a duvet, a television set and a wall-clock.  Would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In your criminal trial you said that you'd been shot in the upper leg, and you had been taken to hospital two weeks before - I beg your pardon, and two weeks before the 17th of June you were discharged.  Is it correct that that incident that you were referring to was the incident which occurred after the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now the house on the corner of Shlube and Bafokeng Streets is house no 734 Bafokeng.  In that house two people were killed, Mr Andries Manyeke, age 50, and Ms Lena Manyeke, age 47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Mr Berger can you just give us the paragraph numbers just to help us, that you're referring to in your memo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm referring to the Annexure, and it's pages 14 and 15 of the Annexure, the last three pages of the document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So it starts at the bottom of page 14, no 734?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that house is on the corner of Bafokeng and Shlube Streets.  Mr Manyeke was stabbed above his waist;  he had back wounds;  he was chopped in the back of the head, and he was also shot above his right eye.  Ms Lena Manyeke was stabbed all over her body, her chest, her head, and there were too many stab wounds to count.  Wasn't the state witness Bujose correct when he said that you entered that house, and doesn't it follow that you were part of a group of people who attacked and killed Andries and Lena Manyeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I was not part of that group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, the other thing that is interesting is, is that according to Mr Bujose you emerged from a house, another house, carrying certain property.  And very close to 734 is 722 Bafokeng Street, and in that house Matilda Shloebe was killed, Elizabeth Shloebe was injured, and Paw-Paw Shloebe was killed.  But what's really interesting is what was stolen from that house.  A TV set was stolen, and amongst other things, a duvet was also stolen.  Two of the items which Mr Bujose - I beg your pardon, Mr Maloi said he saw you carrying out of that house, you and a group of other.  Is this just co-incidental Mr Mbele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> He made a big mistake that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you saying you were not in the area of Bafokeng Street at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> You see, I do not know Boipatong very well when it comes to streets, but I did not get into the houses, he is making a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you together with Sonny Michael Mkwanazi, in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I only remember Makuka, Simon and Gose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Mr Berger, would you just repeat the names, I didn't catch all of them when you asked the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Lax it's one person, his name is Sonny Michael Mkwanazi, he's applicant no 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you saying that you might have been with him, you can't remember, or you were not with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I am saying I did not encounter him where I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Timothy Stals Mazibuko, applicant no 5, were you with ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it correct that the three of you, applicant no 5 and applicant no 7 and yourself, are the three youngest members of the group of applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you're saying the three of you are not friends - were not friends at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> We were friends at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Surely if you were friends, you would have gone to Boipatong - gone on the attack together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I did not know how the next person felt.  You know, we are different when it comes to emotions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no, no, the - what counsel is putting to you is that because you were friends, you must have gone to Boipatong together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I do not agree with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What room were you staying in at kwaMadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> 2023.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what room was Timothy Mazibuko in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> 2002.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Mr Mkwanazi, Sonny Mkwanazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> 2002 as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was your room close to their room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes, nextdoors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when the signal came that you must go to the stadium that night, the night of the 17th, surely you went there together, you, Sonny and Timothy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see them at the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes, I saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Surely you went to stand with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> There was no reason for me to stand with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you standing with other friends?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I was just in a group of people, I would not say who was next to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were a very young man at the time, I take it that you were quite nervous about participating in the attack, or am I wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I was not nervous.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you never felt the need to go and associate yourself with people who you were friendly with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Not necessarily that, there was no need.  But there was no reason for me to go and stand next to them, we were all inside the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when you left the hostel and you moved to Boipatong, did you move together with Timothy and Sonny?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I would not say whether they also left.  I did not see them, I saw the other men who stayed in the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So are you telling the Committee that after you saw Sonny and Timothy at the stadium, you never saw them again from the time you left the stadium until the time you came back to kwaMadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> There is only one person I saw, that person is Stals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That's Timothy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That's him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where did you see him again after the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> When we were approaching Boipatong I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And after you had entered Boipatong, did you see him again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So it's your evidence that you entered Boipatong;  you went to Slovo Park; you went back to kwaMadala - all the time you were with people who you didn't know very well, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I'm saying I knew three people and I was the fourth one, and other men from the hostel, I knew them but their names just went out of my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The three people who you knew, Makuka, Simon and Gose, were they your friends?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes they were my friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What is Makuka's full names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I only know his surname, his surname is Selayi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And where is he today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> He died last year on the 30th of December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Simon, what is his surname and where is he today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> His surname is Molebatsi, he also died last year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Gose, what is his surname and where is he today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> His surname if Mapondo, he also died in 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were referred to the unsigned affidavit of Andries Nosenga, paragraph 4.  The reference in that paragraph is made to Reuben.  Do you know anyone by the name of Reuben?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would that be Tebogo Reuben Magubane, applicant no 3?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Themba, did you know any Themba who was part of the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How many Themba's did you know who were in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm sorry Mr Berger - did you see this Themba ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I do not understand you quite well Sir.  He was present in Boipatong, but he has since died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Which Themba are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I'm referring to Themba Mabote.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were there other people by the name of Themba in the attacking group of Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I only knew that Themba.  I do not know whether there were other Themba's in that group, I only knew this Themba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you know any person by the name of Lucky who was involved in the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sir the individual - you say the people in your group, there are only three that you knew by names, three I think you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Those are the boys from the township.  The other men who were in our company I do not know by names, but there was another one called Damarra Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now the four boys from the townships that you've mentioned, including Damarra, they're all dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There were other persons in the group that you only knew by sight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct My Lord.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are those individuals still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Madala was destroyed and we went into the township to look for alternative accommodation.  I do not know whether they're still alive or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mbele I'll ask you again, are you sure you don't know anybody by the name of Luck, who was present in Boipatong on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> When we went to Boipatong I did not see Lucky, but on the 18th I heard him talking, and it looked like he was present according to what he was saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who is this person called Lucky, what is his surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> It's Sonny Michael Mkwanazi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Your friend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is Sonny Michael Mkwanazi also known as Lucky?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct My Lord.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He's known as Lucky Stikinyao, isn't that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Makuka, you've already told us, he was with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Dondo is you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes, that's me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you sure that you were not in a group of people moving towards Boipatong, which included Tebogo Magubane, Themba Mabote, Sonny Mkwanaze, Makuka, and yourself Dondo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I would not say I was not in their group, but I want to explain this to you Mr Berger ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, I'm listening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> The people that you have mentioned their names, when we left the hostel from, when we left for Boipatong we were in a large group, and we went into the township still being in this large group.  When the shooting began between ourselves and the Defence Units, we managed to chase after them.  That is when we started forming our squads, but we were not more than 15 in number, we were about 11.  This is the group that included Makuka, Vusi, Simone, myself and the other gentlemen that I've referred to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now who is Vusi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I was saying Gose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, according to the state witness Majose, Sonny Michael Mkwanazi or Lucky, was also seen at this house on the corner of Shlube and Bafokeng Streets.  Are you saying that it's just co-incidence that the two of you are friends;  that two of you are referred to in the affidavit of Andries Mosenga;  that two of you are identified by the state witness Bujose as having been in that house at the corner of Shlube and Bafokeng Street, all of this is just co-incidence, it never happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> They've made a big mistake, such a thing never happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman may I enquire, Exhibit J reflects the houses along the various streets in Boipatong.  I've been informed that the houses coloured in an orange koki pen were damaged.  Those marked with a pink koki were people who were killed, and in green where people were injured.  Some houses have all three colour markings.  My Exhibit J indicates the house at Bafokeng and Shlube, the corner thereof, as just having an orange coloration or code.  My learned friend has referred to that house.  If we're referring to the same thing, as where two people were in fact killed.  Can I just ask for clarification please Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> My learned friend is correct, the map is not accurate, it should also have a pink spot, and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand the position, it turned out last time that the colouring on this map is not accurate, and I think attempts were going to be made to ensure that we'll have a bigger map which will truly reflect the position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The house that's been referred to, this is the house that is marked with, is it a cross?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That is the house, yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>	Mr Mbele the day after the attack on Boipatong, did you discuss what you had done, with your friends Sonny and Timothy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> Yes, there were many of us and each one was relating his contribution or what he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what did Sonny say he had done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> He told me that he broke windows at houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> According to the state witness Mr Maloi, he says - or said, that the day after the attack Sonny Mkwanazi, who was accused no 65, said that he had raped somebody in Boipatong.  Did he tell you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I did not hear such a thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did anybody tell you that they had raped or sexually assaulted any of the women of Boipatong, or did you hear from others that they had heard that people had been raped in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> If I remember well, I heard that in Pretoria during the court proceedings.  It was Gose, when he said he saw Lucky raping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where - did he say where he saw Lucky or Mr Mkwanazi raping, which part of Boipatong were they in when he saw Lucky raping?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who else did you hear of who had raped women or sexually assaulted women in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I never heard anyone thereafter about the sexual assault of women, or even the rape of women.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How did you enter Boipatong, which street did you go along?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> I do not know Boipatong well, there is a tarred road in one of the streets, that is the only street that has tar.  We used the last street towards the right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At that time you were in Damarra Chonco's group, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> We were still together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did you divide up into groups and where was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> When we saw the Self Defence Units that is at the tar road inside the township.  There is a gravel street that crosses that tarred road, that is where the group split in two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This splitting into two, was it spontaneous or was it pre-arranged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBELE:</span> According to what I realised on that day, it was a spontaneous thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson I intend traversing fairly quickly what this witness did in Boipatong, but I don't know if that's going to take longer than I anticipate and I see that it's already past 5 o'clock.  I don't know if you want to adjourn at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would this be a convenient point to interrupt a cross-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes it would.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, you referred to the evidence of Mr Maloi and the trial relating to what Sonny said he had done.  What is the page - do you have a page reference for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson the reference I have is at page 309 of bundle 2 of the papers before you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is the extract from the judgment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That is correct.  At page 3757 of the judgment, dealing with accused no 65, who is Mr Mkwanazi, the learned judge deals with the evidence of Mr Maloi and speaks about the rape there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.  At this point we will adjourn for the day.  We will reconvene tomorrow morning at 09h00.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
