But the fact is there is no law firstly, stating that you are not bound by it.  The only law that there is, is a section in the Act which says you cannot be reviewed.\n\tNow with respect, the argument is, those two scenarios which I've postulated in the beginning, they still stand, it's either this way or that way and there is no decision as to it yet.  Yes, we may say at a stage, or a lawyer may say;  I read the conduct of the Commission as being X or going in favour of this point of view or that point of view, but still Chairman, there is no decision on that.  There is no law on that and that is what you are requested to do.\n\tI would submit that the reason why this application is brought, or the motivation for it must be clear, but I don't want to make that quantum leap from the making of that judgment to a bias by this Committee, and therefore I would suggest that there is an intermediate position, and that position is; are you bound or not and then that must be decided by yourself, with respect.

And if this application had been proceeded with and if this application had been dismissed, that would have been one thing, but the allegations still stand despite the fact that the prayers have been withdrawn.  And they are most serious allegations which have been made.  I don't suppose it will help if I go through the application to point out which allegations I'm referring to, so I won't.\n\tMy learned friend submitted to you that those allegations are simply of academic value now, that's not so, they're not of academic value.  They were allegations made on the basis of opinions of a journalist and the applicants called for an investigation, and our submissions would have been that the proper place for that investigation should be here before this Committee, not some other investigation which was being called for by the applicants.  In the same way as the circumstances surrounding the making of Mr Nosenga's application, were investigated here in this forum, so the other allegations of fraud and laundering through the TRC, all those allegations must now be investigated here in front of this Committee.\n\tThe applicants refer to Section 5(l) and (m) of the TRC Act, which says that this Committee has the same powers as the TRC, and we would have argued that that must be read in the context of amnesty hearings.  And yes, it's correct, this Committee has the power to investigate matters, but it must be done within the context of this very hearing, and that's what we would have submitted, and then those allegations against us could have been canvassed and dealt with here.  Those allegations are part of, at the moment part of the record of this amnesty hearing.  The allegations of laundering, of fraud, of forgery, which have been made against us, are part of the record of this very amnesty hearing, and how are they going to be dealt with if not by an investigation here before this Committee into those allegations?  That is why I submit that it's not of academic interest only and it's not - I'll move on.\n\tMy learned friend talks about bias and he says that his opinion as a lawyer is immaterial.  His opinion as a lawyer, with respect, is most relevant and his duty is to inform his clients what his opinion as a lawyer is.  And if he informed his clients that this Committee, as the correct legal position clearly is, is not bound by the findings of the TRC Report, then his clients who have employed him to give his legal opinion would then have their feelings allayed.  I agree with completely with the submission made by my learned friend, Mr Mapoma, as to the status of the TRC Report and as to the powers of this Committee, this Committee has no power to issue a declarator.\n\tIf the findings of the TRC report were binding on this Committee, then the evidence of, for example, Mr Baloyi, would be irrelevant.  The very fact that his evidence is being entertained as being relevant to an issue to be decided by this Committee, should indicate to Mr Lowies, and through him to his clients, that this Committee is not bound and does not consider itself bound by the findings of the TRC Report, because if it were so, then Mr Baloyi's evidence would not be heard.  I submit that there is nothing this Committee can do other than what it has been doing all along, to hear the evidence, and that it is for my learned friend to allay the feelings, the fears, if they exist, of his clients.

            "Yes, okay, very well.  I do not propose to give any detailed reasons for the ruling which now follows, suffice to say the following\nR U L I N G\n\tThis is an application brought by the applicants, save for Mr Nosenga, for an order inter alia that the circumstances under which Mr Nosenga's application was made be investigated.  Secondly, for a declarator as to the status of the findings of the TRC, which are contained in the TRC Report of October last year.  Thirdly, requesting the records of the meetings which led to the findings in issue.  \n\tThe applicants no longer persist in the order that the circumstances relating to Mr Nosenga's application be investigated and also in regard, with the order requesting the records relating to the findings of the TRC, however, they do persist with the declaratory order.\n\tThe background to the application is briefly as follows:  \n\tThe TRC in its Report has made a finding to the effect that the police colluded with the hostel dwellers and took part in the attack on Boipatong.  The presence of the police during the attack is a hotly contested issue before us.  The applicants, all the applicants I should say, except for Mr Nosenga, have denied that the police were present during the massacre.  We were told that because of these findings by the TRC, the applicants entertain a fear that the Committee may well have prejudged the issue, as the Committee is part of the TRC.  Unless the Committee indicates whether it is bound or not bound by the TRC findings, we are told the applicants may well entertain a reasonable suspicion that the Committee would be biased against them.\n\tIn order to allay their fears, it is therefore necessary that this Committee issue a declaratory order as to the status of the findings of the TRC, in particular whether the findings of the TRC are binding on this Committee. \n\tNone of the applicants have deposed to an affidavit setting out what fear they have, or the basis of that fear.  None of the applicants have deposed to an affidavit in which they indicate that they fear, or I should say they are likely to entertain a reasonable suspicion that this Committee is biased or would be biased against them unless this Committee issues the order sought by them.\n\tMr Lowies, who argued the matter on behalf of the applicants, conceded that the issue of the findings is not before us and indeed none of the parties to these proceedings has asked us to have regard to those findings.  Nevertheless, Mr Lowies has argued that the matter may or may not be raised.  \n\tIt seems to me that the threshold question is whether this Committee has the power to make the order sought by the applicants.  This Committee is a creature of statute, it has no other powers other than those which are set out in the Act which constitutes this Committee.\n\tMr Lowies could not point out to any provision of the Act, which either expressly or by necessary implication gives this Committee the power to make the order contended for by the applicants.  He made a broad submission, which if I understood it correctly, was to the effect that under the Act this Committee has the power to regulate its procedure.  That is the provision which he relied upon for the submission that we have the power to make the order sought by the applicants.  However, he conceded that the nature of the order that he is seeking is not a matter of procedure.  In a somewhat feint tone he suggested that it is something akin to a procedure.  This submission is manifestly devoid of any substance when it only states that proposition in order to dismiss it as devoid of substance.\n\tThere is nothing in the Act which manifestly gives this Committee the power to make the order sought by the applicants.  For that reason alone, the application ought to be dismissed.  \n\tIn any event, having regard to the provisions of the Act, it is difficult to fathom how the applicants or any reasonable person for that matter, could entertain a reasonable suspicion that this Committee will act as a rubber-stamp for the findings of the Commission.  There is no foundation for the fear that we are told the applicants have.  \n\tAgain somewhat in a feint tone, Mr Lowies conceded that it is highly unlikely that this Committee can find that it is bound by the findings of the Commission.  \n\tI agree with Mr Mapoma when he submits that any such, if the applicants indeed entertain any such suspicion, such a suspicion has no foundation and it is therefore unreasonable.  For these reasons the application is DISMISSED.",
