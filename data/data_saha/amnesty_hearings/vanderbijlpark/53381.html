<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is the position that the TRC is not ready to argue the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, Chairperson, that is the position.  The TRC is not in a position to argue the application at this stage.  I am still communicating with the National Legal Officer of the TRC, Adv Paddy Prior in Cape Town.  There is an information that I expect him to furnish me which information, part of it Chairperson, has been requested by the applicants.  It is upon me receiving that information, that we will be in a position to go on, thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there any objection if this application stands down?  No objection, yes, very well.  Is there any objection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No objection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes very well, the application will then stand down until the TRC is ready to argue the matter.   Yes Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson, before we call our first witness, we have a document which we would like to hand in as Exhibit BB.  It is, you will recall Chairperson from Exhibit T we sent out numerous letters to amongst others, Iscor, we have received a reply from Iscor, and we would like to hand that bundle in as Bundle BB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you received a copy of this document?  Have you?  All right, okay, this will be Exhibit BB, all right.  Yes Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Sorry Judge, I am getting instructions from all over the show at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But where is the seat where the witnesses are going to sit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That was what we were also thinking about, we thought perhaps it should be on our side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Adv Thomas has just arrived as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could perhaps either, I suppose you want to have an eye contact with the witness, Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Perhaps if the witness could sit on the corner, on the edge and face you, we will be able to have eye contact, and we will all move up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, because otherwise what you can do, you could move onto the edge so that the witness comes more towards the other side, but I will from this position, we will have enough view, sufficient view of the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Ms Cambanis says that she will sit behind for the time being, and then we will shuffle chairs as we go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well, okay.  Perhaps what we should do during the break, could we organise an extra chair so that they can sit whilst waiting for their turn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS THOMAS:</span> Chairperson, I was wondering if this is an opportune time for me to place myself on record and to introduce myself to the entire Committee.  I am acting here on behalf of the ANC, them being an interested party in these proceedings, and needless to mention Mr Chairperson, that I arrived late because not familiar with this place, I got horribly lost, but ultimately one manages to find the place.  My name is Lindi Thomas from the Pretoria Bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ma'am, are you representing the ANC in these proceedings or only in the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS THOMAS:</span> In the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  The request of the TRC, that application has stood down until hopefully at half past eleven, when the matter will then be argued, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS THOMAS:</span> I do understand that Chair, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> If you can just switch off that microphone please, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Sorry about that Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is everyone reasonably comfortable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, it looks like it.  Chairperson, we gave our learned friends today a short list of witnesses who we intended starting with.  The first few names on the list, unfortunately the witnesses haven't arrived, so we are going to start of with Mr Wilson Baloyi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He was a name that we gave yesterday, so I beg leave to call Mr Wilson Baloyi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Would you please get him connected please.  Mr Baloyi, what language do you speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Ii do speak English and Zulu, but I am Shangaan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What language would you like to give your evidence in?</p>

<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Cleopatra?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> She must be 12 or 13, I do not know the ages off by heart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, just a minute.  What did you say is the name of, is her name, is it, I thought you said Cleopela?  What is her name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Cleopatra.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, okay, I see.  All right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Mandu is Cleopatra's mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.  Mandu must be over 37 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Baloyi, I want to take you back to the 17th of June 1992.  Is there anything that happened that you witnessed before the massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Firstly at about five o'clock, I was telephoned by Father Patrick.  He said it seemed as if the people from kwaMadala hostel are going to attack Boipatong or Bophelong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He wants to know whether he can proceed with his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Baloyi, did you say Bophelong or Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is what he told me, he said it seemed they were going to attack on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Baloyi, I wasn't sure whether you said he said they were going to attack Boipatong or he said they were going to attack Bophelong.  What did he say to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He said he was not certain whether they were going to attack Boipatong or Bophelong, but they were going to attack a place, some place between those two townships.  Thereafter I informed my wife that it appeared as if Inkatha was going to attack and that afternoon, later on that evening when I was watching TV, at about twenty past ten in the evening, I heard a noise in the streets.  At first I thought it was comrades just walking passed the street.  I told my wife and children that they should stay up, they should not go to bed because an attack was apparently imminent.  Therefore my wife told my children not to wander around.  At that same time, a Police van arrived, it stopped right in front of my garden.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where were you at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was just seated, fully dressed, watching TV.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If you were watching TV, how could you see the Police van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> My window is big and I could hear the engine running and my window has a lace curtain, so you are able to see what is happening outside, but that person who is outside, cannot see inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Baloyi, can I just ask you to speak a bit slower, because the Interpreter has to keep up with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What did you see through your window?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I saw a Police vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just a minute, what is the word you used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It is a Police vehicle with a back door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, what is the name that you just used, what do you call that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We know it is a "koyoco".</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> A casspir is a smaller vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So this vehicle that you saw, looked bigger than a casspir to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, it was much bigger than a casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It moved off, thereafter there was a noise in the street and I looked through the window, but I didn't see anything, I just heard a noise.  After a while as I was still looking, I saw a large number of people approaching.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Could you describe these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were a large crowd, some were carrying TV's, others were carrying different items.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What were they doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were walking along the street and as they came near my house, they went into the Nqwani household and some went into the Buwa household.  I was watching.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can you just slow down a little bit, I am finding it hard to keep up with you and I am missing bits and pieces.   What was - you said - what was the first house you said they went into, I didn't catch the name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Nqwani, Victor Nqwani's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What street would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Bafokeng Street.  They also went into Buwa's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would that also be on Bafokeng Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, also on Bafokeng Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Baloyi, please slow down.  I was watching, because these two houses are opposite mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All right, what were they doing in those houses, did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They first broke the gates, they broke the windows, I was watching at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You didn't run away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I will come to that later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Right.  Please continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> These windows were big, at Buwa's house they did not use the door to gain access into the house, but they just went in through the windows, because those windows were big.  They broke the door at Victor's house.  We were watching, some of them were walking passed the street.  After they had finished at Victor's house,  they went out, the people at Buwa's house also went out.  Somebody called one of my children, Silo.  He said Dududu, Morene Lucky, these people used to stay with Inkatha members or they used to dance with the IFP members at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who was that person who was calling out to the young people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> This was Mtwana.  These are all his children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you talk about ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, I don't know if I misunderstood you, who is this person who was calling out your children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Mtwana Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the names that he was calling out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He was calling him by Dududu, which was a nickname, Silo's nickname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What did Silo used to do with Mtwana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They used to do traditional dance together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where did they used to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> All over, but they used to practice at kwaMadala hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How did you know that it was Prince Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was watching them, they were outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you actually see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I told my child not to go outside, I told him to go and hide with his mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No Mr Baloyi, my question is did you actually see Mtwana Zulu outside your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I know him very well, I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How did you know him very well, from where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He is married to one woman who stayed four houses away from mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did he used to live in Bafokeng Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Please repeat that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did Mtwana Zulu used to live in Bafokeng Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The house in Bafokeng Street belongs to his in-laws.  He used to come there regularly.  He had a house at Majola Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What happened - slowly please - after you heard Mtwana Zulu calling out the names of the youngsters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He did not come to my house, the people who were at Buwa's house, went out.  The people who left Nqwani's house, then came to my house.  They broke down the gate and the broke all the windows.  My door was broken, by that time I was standing.  They entered the house, I was just looking at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Baloyi, could you describe what they looked like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The people who entered the house had red headbands on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Anything else that you noticed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> One took a hi-fi, one took a box of records, one approached me, he had an axe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I stood in front of my bedroom door, he approached my directly and he wanted to hack me.  I went into the room.  As he tried to come into the room, I slammed the door on him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He fell onto the sofa, he got up and came to me, approached me.  I tried to get him to the room, I was holding onto the door.  He tried to hack me again, I still slammed the door on him, and he fell again.   When he fell, a suitcase that he had been carrying, burst open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We are not getting interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> I was requesting the witness to repeat what he had said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, just before you repeat what you said, Mr Baloyi, are you saying that this person had an axe and at the same time he was carrying a suitcase?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> When they entered, there were three of them, they had brought it along, and they put it on a table.  They were just trying to kill me.  I saw the one person taking a hi-fi, the other took a box of records, they had just put the suitcase there.  When I slammed the door on him, he fell onto a chair, he got up, approached me again wanting to hack me, I still slammed the door on him, and he fell again and then he fell on the suitcase, which then burst open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Mr Baloyi, are you able to hear the Interpreter speaking to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I can hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I noticed that your earphone is not properly on in the ear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I can hear from the right ear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Slowly please Mr Baloyi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> When the suitcase opened, it was full of women's shoes as well as drinking glasses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did the attackers continue to go for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was just one person who was attempting to hack me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was happening in the rest of the house if you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They did not enter into the other rooms.  They just remained where I was in the sitting room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He tried to hack the door, but I closed it.  He continued hacking the door, trying to get it open.  The door still has those marks up to today.  I showed it to my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did they manage to get through the door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, they were unable to enter the room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did they eventually leave your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Somebody was calling, he said "the time is up, we should leave now, leave what you are doing."  He spoke in Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you hear any other languages spoken that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> At that very same time, when they were calling the others, somebody said in Afrikaans "maak gou", which means hurry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That voice that you heard shouting "maak gou", are you able to say if it was spoken by a black person or by a white person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The people who attacked me, spoke in Zulu and that voice was clearly a white person's voice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They all left and went into the forest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I went out, because the door was already broken, I stood in my yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Baloyi, what was stolen from your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They stole records and children's clothing which was on the chair.   The hi-fi, they broke it outside but they did not take it with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Besides the door and the hi-fi, what else was destroyed in your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The glasses that were on display on the sideboard as well as the glasses that had been in that suitcase that they brought along.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was anyone, any member of your family, anyone staying with you, injured during the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> All persons in my family, had hidden in the toilet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So nobody was injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Mandu was just injured when she stepped on the glasses that had been part of the glasses that had been broken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All right, Mr Baloyi, let's go back to, you have now come out of your house, the attackers have left your house, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I saw as they were walking off into the veld, as they were going back to kwaMadala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where were you standing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I was standing outside, things were happening very fast.    I went back to the house checking if no one was injured amongst my children and I realised that no one had been injured because they had hidden in the toilet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I went on to the garage's rooftop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, what did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was able to see everything that was happening out there in the veld.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Could you also see to Amatolo Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I saw it clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Your house is near the corner of Bafokeng and Thembu Streets, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the street, the street to the north of yours is Amatolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And beyond Amatolo is the firms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What did you see if anything, happening on Amatolo Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> At Amatolo I saw the very same Police vehicle that had been standing in front of my house, parked under the tree there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How many Police vehicles did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I saw a casspir and two "koyoco's".</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what were these vehicles doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Let me just finish off - as the IFP people were walking along the veld, they were being led by two of these vehicles.  Two were on the side of the firms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Baloyi, I am sorry, we are not getting the interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, what has he said so far, we haven't heard a thing since the side of the fence?  The side of the veld or side of the fence, veld?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Firms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Oh, firms, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, we want to record what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please speak slowly and allow the Interpreter to interpret what you say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Otherwise some of your evidence will get lost.   Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you please start again, your Counsel asked you what did you see, just start from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I was standing on top of the garage, I saw that vehicle, a "koyoco" parked under a tree in Amatolo Street.  It drove off from that street and went directly to the gate, to the gate in front of the Metal Box factory where the other two vehicles were also parked.  The Police got off those vehicles and they fired shots in the air.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who fired shots, did the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> A Policeman fired, it looked like fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was a huge light and you could see it suddenly, the scene became bright and you could see what was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This was the shot fired by the Policeman into the air, which lit up the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They then left and these two vehicles helped them, they had eliminated the place and they were walking along Umzimvubu towards the main road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Baloyi, the Police vehicles that you describe were moving along Amatolo Street, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Those are separate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now the ones that were moving along Amatolo Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was just one, others were parked under a tree, that is at the Metal Box gate.   It was a casspir and a "koyoco" vehicle, and when the one from Amatolo reached there, it was then three vehicles in total.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where were the attackers at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were in the veld, they were just moving along in the veld.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you spoke about Police vehicles in Umzimvubu Street, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not know where these came from, but there were two of them.  These were the vehicles that had escorted them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me get this, there was what you call a "koyoco" which earlier on during that evening, had parked next to your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then there was a casspir and a "koyoco" which were parked at or near the gate of the Metal Box?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then there were two "koyoco's"?  Are those the ones that were travelling along Umzimvubu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which were providing light to the attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where were the attackers in relation to the vehicles on Umzimvubu Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As they were in the veld, they were walking along and it was dark in the veld, but on the other side, there was light as well as in the township, therefore they were following the casspirs, those vehicles, because they provided light for them.  They went towards the footbridge, there is a furrow there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did the "koyoco", the two "koyoco's" that were travelling along Umzimvubu, did they remain travelling along Umzimvubu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They went along the tar road, it was closed but they used that same road towards the robots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Baloyi,  you mentioned Trek and it wasn't interpreted, are you talking about the garage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, but were they still in Umzimvubu when they reached ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The street is Umzimvubu from the township until you come to the robots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What your legal representative wanted to know from you was, where were their (indistinct) cars, on Umzimvubu Road in relation to the "koyoco's", were they in front of the "koyoco's", on the side or at the back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The "koyoco's" were not travelling very fast, they were driving slowly.  After crossing the furrow, the "koyoco's" then left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Baloyi, you spoke about the street that runs out of the township passed the Trek garage to the robot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The street from the township does not go passed the garage, it actually meets or intersects with this other street, at the robots.  I am saying this tarred road from the township is Umzimvubu and it only ends at the robots, but that road is now closed, a school has since been built there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are these robots near the Trek garage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't that street Noble Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Noble Boulevard is the other one that proceeds towards Cape Gate and that Noble Boulevard meets with Bakoena Street near Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Baloyi, I am going to ask you to explain to the Committee why you came to the conclusion that the Police vehicles were escorting the attackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was obvious to me that the Police were accompanying these people because they were not arresting them.  They had just killed people and they were not arresting them, instead they were walking along with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then did you witness them, or what did you witness after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I was watching, they moved on, along the footpath, and they walked and moved shall I say, behind the nursery firms.   Others moved in front of the nursery firms and they were being followed by these "koyoco's" as they were proceeding towards the compound.  People had come out and they were watching.  Even though people do not want to come and testify, but they were watching.  We had been staying awake and guard till late, we would go to sleep at round about one o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Besides the vehicles that you saw, the Police vehicles, were you able to identify any of the occupants of those vehicles?  Did you see the occupants of any of those vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, no.  I did not see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then they left and returned to kwaMadala, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is there anything else about the attack that you feel you have left out, that you haven't spoken about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There are several things that I have forgotten.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you mean you can't remember now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do remember, but I am saying with your permission yes, I can continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As these vehicles were proceeding, entering the compound, a "koyoco" came back and when it came back, we were now trying to get into cars, people who had been injured from the Buwa household and this "koyoco" drove passed us as we were busy and it stopped at Hlubi.  One white Police and one black Police came out and they took a corpse and put it in the "koyoco" and we were trying to get some of these injured people into the cars and they on the other hand, were putting into the "koyoco", a corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did the ambulances arrive after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> An ambulance came and we took members of the Buwa family into this ambulance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Can you remember roughly what time that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I think it was about twenty passed ten and after that, one did not have time to look at the watch because we were concentrating on what was happening.  The ambulance came after some time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So the twenty passed ten is a time that you put for the start of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is when they came to my household, because I was watching television.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say that is when the attackers reached you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is when they started attacking Victor as well as Buwa's households.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Before the attack and earlier in the day, or in the evening, did you see anything strange in the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I did see something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Two "koyoco's" came  moving along the road on the side of the firms, there were two ambulances that were following the "koyoco's" and these vehicles took the direction of Cape Gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This was before the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know what happened to those vehicles and ambulances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not hear anything, but I later on heard that there were sirens wailing around Slovo, but we don't know what was happening there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Mr Baloyi, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you Chair.   Mr Baloyi, how old are you now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was born in 1920, the 7th of February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So you are 79 years old, is that right?  Have you ever stayed in Senqu Street in Boipatong or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Senqu?  I don't know that name.  What street is it intersecting with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Maybe I can ask you just like that, it may be easier, how long have you been staying at 732 Bafokeng Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you just spell the name of the street that you have just mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Senqu.  It intersects with Bapedi Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That street intersects with Bakoena, further down, at Slovo.  I reside on the other side, this side before Slovo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, how long have you been staying at 732 Bafokeng Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I came into the township in 1955.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And have you been staying in the same house ever since?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I used to stay at Majola Street at number 216.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know another person by the name of Wilson Baloyi that stays in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Which street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In Senqu Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I know all the Baloyi's in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You see, I want to put to you that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Senqu Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No.  There isn't such a name, such a street in Boipatong, I know the whole of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't there a street called Senqu Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Senqu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Senqu Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, there is Senqu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what you are being asked is, do you know of any Wilson Baloyi who stays in Boipatong, particularly in Senqu Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The one that I know, stays in Bapedi Street and other one used to stay at Barolong Street, in Barolong Street, but he has since left.  I am the only Wilson Baloyi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, listen carefully to the question.  We gather from you that there are other persons with the surname of Baloyi in the township, is that right?  Is that right or not, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Counsel is asking you is do you know a person with the name of Wilson Baloyi who stays in Boipatong, in particular in Senqu Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I don't.  The only one Wilson Baloyi, I know, stays in Bafokeng Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Have you ever worked at Cape Gate Construction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You see the reason why I am asking you this, I've got a statement here which we got out of the Police docket, I just want to establish if it is a statement made by you.  The person here is mentioned as Wilson Baloyi, 57 year old person residing at 231 Senqu Street, Boipatong, employed as a labourer at the Cape Gate Construction, so that is definitely not you, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I never worked at a construction.    The one person that I know to be working at Cape Gate, a Baloyi that I know who works there, stays in Majola Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After the attack on Boipatong, have you made a statement to any person in regard to the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you remember if you only made one statement or more than one statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There are many of them that I have made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you remember to whom did you make the first statement after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I went to some Attorneys in Vanderbijlpark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> How long was that after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It had not been long after the attack, even though I cannot be certain of the months that have lapsed after the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you still know the name of that firm of Attorneys where you made the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They called me to come and make statements, I did not go there on my own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, but once you got there, you made a statement, I just want to know if you know the name of that firm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No.  No, I don't know it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know why the Attorneys called you to come and make a statement there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It is not Attorneys, it is in court, we just call them Attorneys, we don't know where they came from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, you will have to explain.  Did you go to,  did you mention Vereeniging or Vanderbijl, let's just get clarity on that, where you went to to see these people that you call Attorneys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Vanderbijl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Vanderbijl?  Did you go to the court in Vanderbijl, the Magistrate's court building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, we didn't go to the Magistrate's office, but yes, we went to the court and we went to an office where everything that was being said, was written down, just like as you are writing now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know if it were people from the Attorney General's office, State officials?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't know, I don't know, I had never been involved in any offences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When you made that statement to these people, did you tell them everything in the same fashion you told the Committee now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were asking me questions, the same way as you people are doing here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you feel free to give all the answers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I had to speak freely, because I am the one who was attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is the first statement.  Did you give a statement after that, do you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying there were many people who had come to make statements.    Many Police would come and take statements.  I was hoping that this would be taken further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And all the statements you gave, you told the Police or whoever took the statements, your full version of what happened at Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And you signed these statements, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I cannot recall whether I signed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Some of these people you gave statements to, you said was also the Police, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, all my statements were given to the Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You say that all your statements were given to the Police, didn't you also give a statement to the ANC Peace Desk in Boipatong itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> At the time the people of the ANC would come to take statements and get our version of the occurrence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So, you did not only give statements to Police, but also to other institutions like the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were asking questions, I am not suggesting that they took statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Baloyi, are you Tsonga speaking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you remember that you made a statement on the 27th of July 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Excuse me Mr Strydom, before he answers that question, Mr Baloyi, if you say you are (indistinct), are you specifically saying you are Tsonga because even Venda's say they are (indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am Tsonga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you remember giving a statement to the Police on the 27th of July 1992 at Boipatong itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying the Police came, it was very difficult to monitor the dates, because there was conflict, there was fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you suggesting during July 1992, there was fighting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying at the time, the entire Boipatong was sick after the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, we understand that there is no one who had the opportunity at the time, to record the dates and the time when statements were taken, but what you are being asked is whether do you recall making a statement to the Police in July of 1992, the answer to that question is either yes, I recall or I don't recall.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did give the Police a statement, but I cannot commit myself to July.  I am not certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That statement that you gave the Police, did they come to your house to take the statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Some came to my house and I was refusing to give them a statement because I was furious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You did not want to cooperate with the Police when they asked you to give statements, is that what you are saying, at a certain stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not trust them because I saw them on the night of the massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So initially you were not prepared to give them a statement?  Did you later on give the Police a statement or not, which you had signed?  It is a statement which they had taken and you signed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I later on gave them a statement, the very same Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why were you prepared to give a statement at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They pleaded with me saying they wanted to know what happened, that is why I gave them the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Will it be a convenient stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes indeed, we will take the tea adjournment and return at half past eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, are you ready?</p>

<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On Tuesday last week, I indicated that the application would be argued at nine o'clock today, is there any reason why they are not ready now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Mr Chairman, speaking for myself, at this moment where I am sitting, I am not in a position to explain.  The problem that I have is that all this information was transferred to our Cape Town office and I expressed to them the urgency of this matter and I explained everything to them, and also that this matter would be argued today, but unfortunately I am as disappointed Chairperson, I regret.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who appears for the ANC here?   Are you available Ma'am, tomorrow morning at nine o'clock?</p>

<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Matengane, and he acted as an Interpreter to translate from Tsonga to English, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you remember if he just acted as an Interpreter or is he the person who took the statement from you and simultaneously interpreted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He interpreted and he also wrote down what he was writing.  They are the same Police Officers that I had first refused to give a statement to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you spoke to Mr Matengane, was there another Police Officer present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He was in the company of a white Police Officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right, and was Mr Matengane interpreting what you were saying to this white Police Officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And did you feel free to tell the Policemen there everything you knew about the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> At that time, I did not feel free because I was in pain because all the windows had been broken and the air would come into the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you say it was too cold to give a proper statement, or a full statement, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did give a statement on what I knew.  I did not explain everything to him but I just explained about what happened at my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, but I want to know why did you not explain everything to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He did not enquire about everything else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But didn't he ask you to tell him what you know about the attack on the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, he just enquired about what had happened at my house that the damage had incurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did he ask you to tell him what you saw on that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I did tell him that I saw the IFP and white Police Officers as well as casspirs and "koyoco's".</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And after the statement was written down, did you sign that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am not sure.  I could have signed it, but I am not certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was the statement read over to you after it was taken down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They did, I did hear what they were saying, but I was not in a position to listen very carefully.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say because you were in pain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What I mean is that at the time when they asked questions, they were just asking questions, but at the time I was feeling pain because I had no money to replace everything that had been damaged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The pain that you felt, was it a physical pain or a pain because you felt bad about what had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Firstly if you are in emotional distress, the entire body is also affected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, that is not the question that - you are being asked whether was this a physical pain that you are talking about, or some other pain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was emotional pain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were you happy with the Interpreter, that he could do his job properly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He interpreted well because he spoke fluent Shangaan, but my heart was still sore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Are you happy that everything you said, was written down and taken up in the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The statement was not read to me, I do not know what they wrote down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But Mr Baloyi, earlier on you said that the statement was read to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, what I am saying now is what I know to have written what I said when they took the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, but let's ask again.  After the statement was taken, maybe before you signed, was this statement read to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, they did read it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And you were happy with what was written down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I was satisfied that they had written what I had told them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So everything you had told them, was written down, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know whether they did write everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Baloyi, you were giving the information then they wrote it down and then they read the statement to you, so you could hear if everything you said, was written down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What I am saying is they read what they had written down what I had said before, to them, and I agreed that I was happy that it was what I had said to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Maybe I must put it this way, nothing important which you had mentioned, was left out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not really take notice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you tell the person that took the statement about the participation of Mr Vanana Zulu during the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I mentioned before, yes I did tell him as it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And when the statement was read back to you, was that portion contained in the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They did read, but I cannot say at this point whether that portion was read back to me, or whether I heard it or whether they had omitted it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you regard it as an important part of your statement, the fact that you recognised Prince Vanana Zulu in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying when they approached my home, two houses were first damaged, that is Victor Nqwani and Buwa's house.  He was standing outside on the lawn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And all this detail, you gave to the person who took the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I did tell them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you tell them that prior to the people that arrived, the attackers that arrived in the vicinity of your house,  "koyoco" stopped at that house or close to your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was parked in front of the garden, I was watering my garden.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At what time did you water the garden, was it already dark or was it still day time or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I said we were waiting because we had been aware that they were on their way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, but that doesn't answer the question, when you watered the garden, was it already dark or was it still day time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was around six, seven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Being winter time, then it must have been dark, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, just for the record, he said six, seven, eight, it wasn't interpreted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, so being winter time, it was at night when you watered the garden, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am not sure whether you regard seven as night or not, I am not in a position to respond to your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Baloyi, maybe you can give me the answer because I have been trying to establish if it was dark or if it was still light.  When you watered the garden, was it dark or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was watering the garden, the grass.  When I started it was not dark, but eventually it got dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At that stage, according to you, you knew that there was a possibility of an attack on Boipatong or Bophelong that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I said before, the Priest who had been sitting down there, telephoned me and informed me that his Parishioners had told him that the IFP would attack either Bophelong or Boipatong.  That is what I said before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I missed that, who told him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, the question that was asked of you was did you tell the Police that you saw a "koyoco" pulling up in front of or next to your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I said before, I told them everything that had happened, even including the "koyoco" vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That "koyoco" vehicle, where did it come to a standstill in relation to your position where you were watering your garden?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Do  you see where I am sitting, my garden would be out there.  There is a brick fence and there is grass outside the fence.  That is where the casspir parked.  Even the white people who arrived the next morning, could see where the vehicle had been parked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When this "koyoco" came, were you still outside watering your garden?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, by that time I was already in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you give an indication how long before you saw the first attackers, did you see that "koyoco" in front of your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They followed the vehicle, it came and first parked and as the people approached near to the house, it drove passed towards Amatola.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Mr Baloyi, the question was can you remember how long it took between the time the vehicle parked and the time the attackers came.  How much time passed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was not long before they arrived.  It was just a few minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But you testified earlier that you watered the garden between six, seven and eight, so after you had finished watering the garden, you went into the house and shortly thereafter, did you see this "koyoco" or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> After watering the garden, I went into the house and the "koyoco" came thereafter, that is when the attackers were approaching from behind.  As they came nearer the house, the "koyoco" drove off towards Amatola and parked under a tree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When the "koyoco" stopped in front of your house, next to your house, you were inside your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I was in the sitting room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you sitting down or were you standing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was standing watch because something was going to happen, I was standing next to the window, watching.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see the people coming behind the "koyoco"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, very clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So you were not watching TV?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I was.  My windows are big, they are that big.  The TV was about that distance away and there was  a hi-fi next to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You were standing and you were watching TV, is that what you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying as I was watching TV, I could also see through the window because the TV is close to the window.  But when I heard the noise, I stopped watching TV.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you first saw the "koyoco", were you standing at the window or were you sitting down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now let's take it step by step, you are sitting down, watching TV, what is the first thing now that happens after that in relation to what you have heard and what you saw afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The first thing that I saw was the "koyoco", secondly people approached and they damaged these two houses that I was talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Just stop there.  In your seated position, could you see the "koyoco"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Very clearly.  My window is huge and it is low.  You are even able to see a person walking outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now the window that you are referring to, is that the window on the front side of your house, facing the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The two windows that I am speaking of, face the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were you sitting in the dining room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was in the sitting room, not the dining room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Sorry, I wanted to say sitting room.  Yes, you were sitting in the sitting room and that's got a big window you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It is not just one big window, there are many.  I was just watching through this one window.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, and these windows did they have only lace curtains or other curtains as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It does have other, it has a lace curtain and another curtain but I always open the curtains so that you can just see through the lace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> From your seated position, you could see the "koyoco" through the lace curtains in the street, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, very clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When you saw this vehicle, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I told my children that the Police have arrived, so you should be ready, keep watch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Ready for what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I had already heard that an attack was imminent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, but now you see a Police vehicle, how did you know that the Police will be part of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The Police were involved in this, they started during the day and fired teargas.  They closed all the holes that we had made on the road.  They came with tractors and closed up all those roads and they chased the comrades away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see that, that they chased the comrades away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I saw it because we had also taken part in digging up these holes.  We were trying to prevent the "koyoco's" from travelling on that road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why did you want to prevent "koyoco's" travelling in those roads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We did not want the Police in the township because they harassed people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were you happy with the policing which was done by the Self Defence Units?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, we were very happy about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Am I correct in saying that at that stage, at that time, you were very negative towards the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, we did not want them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What did you personally witness during the course of that day, the Police do in the township?  You already said that they filled up holes which were dug in the roads, what else did you personally see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not see anything else, I just saw them filing up the holes and I later saw them lighting up the area so that the Zulu's would be able to walk free.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When did you see the area being lit up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> When they were at the Metal Box, near the gate.  The casspirs all parked around there, they shot something in the air, something like fire and the area lit up.  That is what I saw the Police doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Baloyi, what I am trying to establish, the things that happened during the course of the day, before the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The occurrence during the day was the filling up of those holes by the tractor, the tractor was being escorted by the "koyoco".</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So this evidence you gave about teargas, you heard from someone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Some of these teargas canisters fell on my premises, I still have them to date, witness to this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was that during the course of that day, prior to the attack that those canisters fell into your yard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was on the very same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see who threw these canisters into your yard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were shooting, not black people, it was whites, the white Police people and the comrades fled into our yards and they were being pursued by the Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When was that during the course of that day, can you give a time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was in the afternoon, the tractor started filling up the holes around three or four and later on, these other vehicles came firing this teargas canisters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who did they fire these canisters to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were firing at the comrades, getting them out of the way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And these comrades, where were they standing in relation to your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> My house is the second from the point, I don't know how to measure.  Our houses are small, they don't have big yards and they would stand there and we would guard from our homesteads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were they standing in front of your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Not in front of my house, but a little distance from my house.  I am referring to the fourth row of chairs, that is the distance where the furrow had been dug out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, can you just give me the distance from that side to where, I think he is referring to the fourth row of chairs from where you are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> You see from the person who is wearing a white jersey, that lady there, and my next door neighbour's house would be on this other side and here you would be having the fence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Between 15 and 20 metres approximately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, did you say between 15 and 20 metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> 15 and 20 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Thank you Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you.  So these comrades were standing about 15 to 20 metres from your house when you saw the Police came and fired teargas canisters at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought you say 15 to 20 metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes 15 to 20.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, I thought you said 50?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, no, 15 to 20, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying that is correct because when they fled, they jumped fences into my yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And this happened at approximately if I remember correctly, half past four in the afternoon, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The tractor came to fill up the holes in the company of a "koyoco" and another one came thereafter, this is the one that was firing at the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was it still during day time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, around six o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And then that tractor left which filled the holes and the "koyoco" left with the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It vanished into other streets, I don't know where it went to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If the comrades wanted to regroup, they had ample time to regroup up to a stage before the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They would come together and mill around fires and they would flee on seeing a "koyoco", they would flee into people's yards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And later they will regroup, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.  They were not stationed in one place, they were moving around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Tell me, this firing of canisters to the comrades, was that a thing that happened from time to time, was it a thing that used to happen to disperse them or did it only happen on that one day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was common place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And the filling of holes that were dug in the road, were they filled from time to time by the Police or other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It had never been filled up by other people before, it was filled up by the Police on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> These comrades, did they use to build barricades or barriers in the road so that vehicles could not travel there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is exactly as you put it, we had also dug out trenches, not only the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Those barriers were removed from time to time by the Police, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Baloyi, what I want to know is how did you gather after you saw these things the Police did on that day, that they will be part of an attack later on during that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not get your question quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You testified that when you saw the "koyoco" outside your house, you realised that the attack is now about to start and then I asked you but how did you know that the Police would be involved in the attack and you said that earlier on, during the day, teargas was fired and holes in the roads were repaired, and therefore you could say that the Police would be part of the attack?  But in the light of what you have testified that it was not unusual that the Police would fire teargas, and it was not unusual for them to break down the barricades, on what basis can you say that the Police were involved, or that you expected that the Police were going to be involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I will put it this way maybe you will understand, I am saying we used to guard the area, like receiving a phone in my house.  A phone, a telephone call to the effect that Boipatong was going to be attacked and it dawned on me that this suspicion is indeed true, because of the deeds of the Police, the closing up of the trenches so that these "koyoco's" can move about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just listen to the question.  You see you have told us that in the past, barricades would be erected at the township, including digging the holes and that the Police would come and remove those barricades and from time to time, the Police would disperse the comrades, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now when you saw the "koyoco" later that evening, the one that stopped next to your house, you warned your family that the attack was about to start.  What Mr Strydom wants to find out is how did seeing the Police with the "koyoco" outside, indicate to you that Boipatong was about to be attacked?  Do you understand what I am saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I understand.  Earlier on I said on receiving the phone call, I was informed about the imminent attack and for all the while we did not know that we were going to be attacked by Inkatha, but on that day I heard.  Now on seeing these actions, that is what came to my mind that indeed, these people had come and the closing up of the trenches by the Police and the removal of the barricades, all of these things were such that things were different in their actions that day because they would shoot or fire at people with teargas canisters on sight.  As they were continuing closing up the trenches, we were looking, we were not asleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Is it  your evidence that when you got the telephone call from the Priest, he said that possibly Boipatong or Bophelong would be attacked by residents of kwaMadala hostel?  Is that what you said or did you specify who was going to attack the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He was saying that there is one among the two townships that was going to be attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did he say who was going to attack the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He said Inkatha was going to attack us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Now if he said that it was Inkatha that was going to attack, why did you think that the Police were going to attack you when you saw them, why did you link the Police with the Inkatha  when you saw the "koyoco" in front of your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Because earlier on when they started firing these teargas, they were indiscriminate and some of this teargas would go into people's houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We understand that the Police shot teargas, but what you are being asked is that the warning given to you was that it is the IFP that was going to attack either Boipatong or the other township.  What you saw standing next to your house was a Police vehicle, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was not an Inkatha motor vehicle, was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, it was not an Inkatha vehicle, but they used to work in collusion with the IFP, they would frequent the hostel from time to time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the Police were working with the Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When the Police came earlier that day, shooting the teargas at the comrades, you did not think that was the beginning of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You just said that the Police used to frequent the hostel, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What I am saying is that I would see the "koyoco's" going to the hostel, they would come through the township, head straight for the hostel.  The Vaal Command would come to the township and they would also go to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But what is sinister about that, I mean that is the main road going to Iscor, that can be part of a normal patrol so is there anything sinister in your mind, about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The other vehicles would not go straight to Iscor.  They would just go and park in front of the hostel at the parking lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see them there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was not for the first time that I saw them do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Could you see from your house at 732 Bafokeng Street, what is going on in front of the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not mean that I saw them parked at the hostel, but from my house I can see as far as the robots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.  Mr Baloyi, it seems to me what you want to suggest is that the IFP and or kwaMadala hostel was in cahoots with the Police, is that what you are saying, for a long time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.  Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Because when we were attacked, they were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So only at the stage when the township was attacked, did you form that opinion that the Police and the IFP were working together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It confirmed that they were working together because they travelled together after the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I will return to the house, you say that you saw the "koyoco" outside and you thought that was the beginning of the attack.  Did you tell your wife that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.  I told her that the people who were going to attack us, have arrived.  The engine was not even running.  Normally when they travel along the road, they will make a lot of noise, the engine would make a lot of noise, but on this particular day, it was just silent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you tell your family to run away or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I told them to go into the toilet because it was big and it had a steel door.  I also told Dududu to go into the toilet as well, and that they should lock the door and wait there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you move to the window to have a better look?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> My dining room looks like this space here, whether you are seated or standing, you can see outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So did you remain seated, is that what you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I did not continue sitting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What did you do, Mr Baloyi, that is what I want to find out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I stood by the window and looked at the street, I also went into the bedroom and looked through the window.  I was just keeping watch all over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So this "koyoco" was clearly visible, did it have its lights on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, the lights were on dim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Before that stage when you saw the vehicle, did you hear any shots being fired in the township or anything of the kind or was the first sign for you that there was an attack, when you saw the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The shots were fired at Nqwani's home, the house that they went to as I was watching through the window.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But before you saw the vehicle, did you hear any shots being fired or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No.  I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When you looked through the window and you saw this vehicle, apart from the vehicle that had its lights on dim, what else can you say about the occupants, about anything else in relation to this vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, it is not possible to see the occupants.  You can't see properly, you cannot identify a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So it was dark, is that what you are saying?  Was it dark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, there was sufficient light.  You could see everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What source provided the light outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I hope you know what the township looks like, there are tall electric poles and they provide light, you can see just about everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Those Apollo lights, are those the lights that are there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Isn't it so that the closest Apollo light to you, is the light in Batswana Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Oh, you know because from Batswana Street, it casts a very bright light to my area or to my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If I put it to you that the Apollo light is more or less in front of house 790 Batswana Street, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I know the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is why I am asking you, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If this light was so bright, why didn't you see the people in the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The windows of that vehicle are not very big, you cannot see a person or an occupant properly.  You just see them a bit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What was the colour of this vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am not a Police Officer to know the different colours.  The Police are the people who know the colours very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But these "koyoco's" and other Police vehicles used to patrol the streets of Boipatong during that time, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, they would not patrol, they would just be parked in front of our houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So it was absolutely nothing strange to see one of those vehicles in the township, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was not strange, but because of the attack, I would say it was surprising.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If these "koyoco's" used to come and park in front of your houses, why are you not able to tell us what the colour of this "koyoco" was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I will put it this way, white people are very clever.  After they had attacked, the "koyoco's" or after an attack, all these "koyoco's" would be resprayed in a different colour.    Therefore  you cannot really speak about the colour, because they would respray all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before they were sprayed, what colour were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The casspirs are yellow, the pick up vans, Police pick up vans are also yellow.  The casspir has a blue stripe as well as a blue light on top.  The "koyoco's" have a back door.  The colours are sometimes grey and some have the same colour as Police camouflage uniforms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, the "koyoco" has more than one colour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, the "koyoco" that would normally come, the Vaal Command would have a yellow colour.  The Police "koyoco's", they are grey but they seem to have other spots, just like the Police camouflage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It seems to me you know quite a lot about these vehicles and the colour that used to travel in that township, so can I gather from that that they used to frequent the township during that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> You cannot compare what happens now, to the time that has passed.  I am only speaking on what happened then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I am also referring to that period.  Is it so that those vehicles used to travel there on a very regular basis in the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, they would normally park there near the Metal Box.  That is where they were on the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Isn't it so that the holes that were dug and the barriers that were put up, can't really stop those huge vehicles travelling in those streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We were not just stopping or preventing vehicles, but the "koyoco's", the vehicles that used to travel along the township and be involved in the killing of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But what I put to you is that those barriers and holes can't stop those vehicles travelling in the township, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, we only stopped the Police vans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was your question not that these barricades and holes could not stop these motor vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, that is the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, would you please repeat the question to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> From the 17th, the barricades were no longer effective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The question is before the 17th, these barricades and holes could not stop these Police or military vehicles travelling in the Boipatong township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They did prevent them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, what is being put to you is that these barricades that were erected in the township, did not stop Police vehicles from coming into the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, they used to come into the township and they would manoeuvre around these barricades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.  To get back to the colour of the vehicle, the "koyoco", in front of your house, you testified that you thought now that the attack was about to start, was it important for you to look properly to see whose vehicle was standing outside, the Police or the Vaal Commando or the military or whoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I could see it clearly, that it was a Police vehicle.  I am not a child, but I saw it clearly that it was a Police vehicle, I know those vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why do you say it was a Police vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They used to pass by the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is that the only reason why you thought at that time that it was a Police vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It is not that I thought it was a Police vehicle, I saw that it was a Police vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But you can't give the colour of that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not concentrate on the colour, but I was concentrating on the people coming to attack me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Just to get clarity, do you know a hippo vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The hippo has an open roof and a Police casspir has a blue light on top, it is yellow in colour and has a blue stripe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And the only difference between a casspir and a "koyoco" is the position of the door, is that correct or not?  Let me just rephrase, what I want to understand is the difference between a casspir and a "koyoco".</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I cannot speak much about those two, it is my child who is a Policeman who can clearly differentiate between the two, whether the doors are different or not, it is something that I would not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> According to you is a casspir and a "koyoco" one and the same thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, they are not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> How do you distinguish between the two then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The "koyoco" is big.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It is bigger than a casspir, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is how I see it.  I don't know whether it is bigger in age or what, but that is how I see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have said that the "koyoco" is big, did you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, it is big.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you mean when you say it is big?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is what I have said.  It is something that is big.  I do not know how I can explain it to you or measure it, but it is bigger than the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Is it taller, is it wider, is it greater in size?   We are trying to understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It is big, it is tall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The "koyoco's", do they have blue lights or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I haven't seen it.   What I did see was the white people who were shooting on top.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When did you see white people shooting on top?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> At the gate at Metal Box, on the very same day, the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If you say on top, were they standing on the roof, because its got a roof, this "koyoco"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were standing on the ground, they had gotten off the vehicles and they were shooting, pointing on top.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know the word "nyala"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The "nyala" is the smaller one, but I am not sure, I do not want to commit myself, it is only the Police and the military personnel who know precisely what colour the vehicles are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have given evidence here, telling us about a Police motor vehicle that stopped next to your house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That was a "koyoco".</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Counsel is trying to find out is whether you can distinguish between the various motor vehicles.  If you can, you will tell us yes, if you cannot, you will say so.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.  The vehicle that was parked in front of my house was a "koyoco", not a "nyala".</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During the course of that night of the attack, did you see a "nyala" at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I saw it when the vehicles were already parked at the gate, that is at the Metal Box gate, I did not see it inside the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And you must correct me if I am wrong, is that "nyala" smaller than a casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They are two different Police vehicles.  There is a bigger and a smaller one.  In fact there are three, there is a Police van, then the small and a bigger Police vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But you said that you saw a "nyala" later in front of Metal Box.  All I want to know is is that vehicle, the "nyala" vehicle you are referring to, is that a smaller vehicle than a casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, but I do not want to commit myself to this.  All I am saying is that the vehicles that I spotted there, were two "koyoco's" and a smaller vehicle with a side door, and it had a light on top as well as a stripe on the side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You testified that you told your wife and children to go and hide themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were they hiding themselves from the moment when you said that there is a vehicle outside and the attack has now started until after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> When I told them this, it was not just that they all went there at the same time, they had to inform everybody who was in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, that is not the question, the question is were they hiding themselves for the full duration of the attack until after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, they were in the toilet, they did not leave the toilet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At what stage did your wife come out of the toilet?  What were you doing at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I went outside to check if it was safe and to just check on what had happened inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you go back then to tell your wife and children that it was safe now to come out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And your wife, did she come out of the house with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Not a single one was left in the house or remained in the house, they all went outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At that stage, could you still see the Police vehicles at Metal Box, when your wife came out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.  They were still parked there.  They were still waiting for everyone amongst the attackers to arrive there and they would thereafter leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Your wife must have seen, like you did according to you, some of the attackers and these vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> She only saw the vehicles at a distance, but she did not see the attackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Could you still see the attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At what stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At the time his wife was now also outside, when she saw the military vehicles.  Could you still see the attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There were some who were still on their way, because they were carrying items.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are asking him about military vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Sorry, I would just refer to the vehicles, the Police vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Da Silva, I would have thought you would have been the first one to complain.  Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The Police vehicles that you are referring to, when you saw them, your wife saw them according to you?  You could still see attackers but she couldn't, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> My wife was more concerned with the children, she came out and she looked out for a while and then she went back into the house, to check on the children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you point the Police vehicles to her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> She saw them for herself, I did not have to point them out to her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say your wife was looking after the children, where were they, were they inside of the house or outside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> When they left the toilet, there was broken glass all over the floor.  My wife just went out momentarily to check outside and she went back to the ...  They did go out, but we had to stand guard, be aware if these people were still hiding somewhere and they are going to come back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see - at a later stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I see it is one o'clock, will this be an appropriate stage because I want to turn onto something else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well, thank you.  We will take the adjournment and return at two o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MACHIHLILE WILSON BALOYI:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Strydom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STRYDOM:</span> (continued)   Thank you Chairperson.  At the stage when you saw the "koyoco" outside your house, did you hear any people crying outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At a later stage did you hear people crying or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After you saw the "koyoco" you sent your wife to go and hide, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct and the children as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.  Is your wife's name Mary Baloyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As it appears there, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You are aware that she testified during the criminal trial, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> She testified in Pretoria, I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> She testified in Pretoria, I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did your wife testify at the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, there was a criminal proceeding or criminal prosecution that was going on in Pretoria, I think that could have been the one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At the stage when the attack on your house started, your wife must have been in the bathroom for some time, hiding?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I said when they attacked or as they were just about to attack, I instructed my wife to prepare the children and take them to the toilet where they had to hide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, but you testified already and I don't want to repeat my questions but that was the stage when you saw the "koyoco" outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I said the "koyoco" came first and the noise was a distance away, it was still at Bafokeng and it came moving slowly until it grounded to a halt in front of my house.   From then it moved to the tree at Amatola Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, so apart from seeing the "koyoco" in front of the house, you heard it coming along, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> He said he heard a noise, Mr Strydom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Well, the noise you heard, what noise was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was a noise of people whom I thought perhaps were comrades, because they used to sing all the time, or most of the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And then you sent your wife to go and hide herself and the children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not send her at that time, no, not at that time.  We were hearing this noise all together, I only sent her away when we started hearing windows being shattered.  Not windows at my homestead, but windows in those two houses.  That is when I actually could now make out as to who these people were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So at the stage when your house was attacked, your wife was hiding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> When my house was attacked, I had already told them to hide in the toilet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Apart from the fact that you told her, was she still sitting next to you in the dining room or not or in the sitting room, sorry, in the sitting room or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> She had been trying to take the children to sleep.  Had she been found doing that, perhaps they could have killed them all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What are you testifying that she had tried to put the children to sleep at this stage?  What do you mean by that?  I thought you said earlier on that you told her to hide herself and the children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We had a small baby and the baby was three weeks old, and there were children as well.  Some of them were woken up actually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you state today where your wife was at the stage your house was attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> You see, I don't know how to put it because you don't know my house.  She was standing in the kitchen and she heard this noise when the Buwa and the Victor households were being attacked, then she was standing in the corridor and when they knocked the gate, that is when the gate was knocked down, I told her to take the children to the toilet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But at that stage you already told her that you saw a Police vehicle outside or a "koyoco"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want to put to you, your wife, when she testified in Pretoria at the criminal trial, she said nothing that you told her that you saw a "koyoco" outside.  She doesn't mention it at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am hearing this from you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, just for record purposes, I am going to refer to Volume 22 of the typed criminal record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just before we get to that, Mr Baloyi, it would be very helpful if you would answer the questions directly.   If the answer is yes, you say yes, if it is no, you say no.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, I just want to get this clear.  When you saw the "koyoco" outside, you told your wife that the attackers are here, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I told her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you told them that they must hide, they must go into the toilet and hide?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I said they should prepare themselves to go and hide in the toilet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.   Did she go immediately after that warning, to the toilet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, she did not go to the toilet at that very same moment, because the children were also puzzled as to what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then you testified about three people I think you said, who came into your house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There were three of them who came in after breaking the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Did they break the gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, it was broken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now when they broke the gate, your wife was not in the toilet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, she had not been to the toilet as yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When the gate was broken, you again warned her to go and hide in the toilet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What is it, the three people, let me rephrase ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Before you, you were going to give us a reference to that bit of evidence you put to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you put to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want to put his wife's evidence at the criminal trial, at page 2556.  The first thing that I want to put to you is that your wife said nothing about you telling her about the "koyoco" outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I think it was up to her at the time of making the statement, I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Your evidence in this forum was "I informed my wife that it appeared as if Inkatha is going to attack us", that is after you saw the "koyoco" outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I did say that because I received a phone call to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Your wife testified further after she was asked to explain what had happened that night, she said "well, initially I heard people crying outside in the street."</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> She said what things she thought appropriate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And then she went ahead to say "I was still sitting with the children in the house ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> I am sorry for the interruption Chairperson, may the witness please repeat the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr Strydom is doing now, he is reading to you what your wife is supposed to have said when she gave evidence at the criminal trial, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what he is doing, he is merely reading to you what your wife said.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> She stated that she was still sitting with the children in the house and the next thing, she saw stones being thrown, well she didn't see the throw, but just saw stones coming into the house, through the window and then she took the kids and went to the toilet.  To summarise she says she was sitting, the next moment she heard a noise, the next moment stones were flying into the house and then she went to the toilet?  Is that how it happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What I know is this, that at roundabout ten o'clock, many children are already asleep and those who would still be awake, are the older ones.  I told them that we are now being attacked and I said to Dududu that she should accompany the mother to the toilet to hide themselves.  I was sitting there with a young boy with whom I used to sit there.  The rest of them were preparing for sleeping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, that I understand but all I am asking you is this, what I have put to you and what your wife testified, is that correct that she was sitting there, she heard a noise and the next moment stones flew into the house and then she went to the toilet to hide?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, it is true that stones did come into the house through the windows, but I don't know about the rest of the things that she said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So when the stones came into the house, was she still sitting or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> She was standing next to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you tell her that the Priest phoned earlier that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want to put to you that she mentions nothing of the kind in this testimony of hers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I know very well that she could not have spoken everything that I told her.  She only testified about things that she witnessed herself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You testified here that she came out of the house after the attack and she could also see Police vehicles.  I want to put to you that nothing of the kind is stated in her testimony, or appears in her testimony?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was difficult at the time to speak about these things.  My wife was frightened, she could not have spoken about these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So do you say that according to you, her testimony does not tell the full truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I cannot tell her truth.  I only know what I am saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Because I want to put to you that what you are saying, is not the truth, and she told the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am telling you now, I can take you now to show you evidence of what I am talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I am not saying your house was not attacked, what I am putting to you is that you did not see the "koyoco" outside at the stage when you testified, and you did not see the attackers walk alongside with these Police vehicles.  That is the part of your evidence that you made up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I saw them, I am not fabricating this.  I can take you along right now to show you where I was seeing them from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Your wife was asked about casspirs but she was asked the following question</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>" ... Did you hear the sound of vehicles, heavy vehicles for instance a casspir which passed by the house?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a>	That was the question and her answer -</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a>"... No, the only sound that I heard was shots that were fired."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is her testimony, because the casspirs were not making a noise as they were moving, because they were moving slowly and there was the breaking of windows going on at the same time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That I understand but according to you, she saw these vehicles not far from the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, she said she saw these vehicles?  I am the one who saw these vehicles and pointed them out to them.  I pointed it out to everyone who came early the following morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now to return to that statement I asked you earlier on about,  and just to refresh your memory that is the statement where the Interpreter was Mr Matengane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I have answered that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want to put to you that also in this statement, you say nothing about that "koyoco" vehicle that came to a standstill there in front of your house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't know, if he did not include that, that is his mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I would have thought that we would have been entitled to a copy of that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I am going to hand it out right now.  Chairperson, this is a typed copy which was obtained from the Police docket, can it be handed out as Exhibit CC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, what is being put to you is that in the statement which was taken from you with Mr Matengane interpreting, you made no mention of a "koyoco" which stood in front of your house, do you understand that?  Do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know why it is not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We spoke many things and they wrote many things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But as far as you can recall, you told them about the "koyoco"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is the original?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, we are not in possession of the original, this is the only document we could find in the Police docket, we could not find the original.  Apparently the full contents of the docket is with Mr Kjellberg, but our investigation could only get this document which is obviously - well, it purports to be a typed document of the original.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Shall I just enter this statement first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, if I can just mention, it seems to me that my learned friends did better investigations than us, they got the original, well, a copy of the original, but not the typed one, also available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is that?  If it is there, it is okay, I was just curious to know whether we do have the original.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you Chairperson, if I can just show this written document to the witness to identify his signature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Baloyi, I am going to show you a photocopied document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I am waiting for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The statement that was taken, can you identify your signature, I saw two places where you possibly signed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I am the one who signed here, not here.  This is my signature and this one too, and this one too.  These ones, no, I don't know these two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, just for the record, on the first page, numbered 1, Mr Baloyi has indicated that the signature at the bottom of the page is his, but not in the left hand margin; at the bottom of page 2 he has indicated his signature, it is his; the bottom of page 3 he has indicated that it is his signature, but not his signature in the left hand column; and no signature on page 4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Baloyi, are you happy that that is the statement that was taken from you when Mr Matengane acted as Interpreter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, those are my signatures.  I cannot account for places where I have not appended my signature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, the signature that he has admitted, would that be the one where there are just two initials, is it MB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, it is the two initials at the bottom of the page.  Nothing in the margins, but all the initials at the bottom of the page, it would appear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Would you at some point make copies of the other document, I think it is marked, of the copy of the hand-written statement and make it available, perhaps tomorrow morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> We will do so, I can even do better now, I've got the true original here with me, so I will make copies using this document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, indeed, would you do that.  Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Baloyi, I want to read to you the first three paragraphs of this document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Has anyone checked whether the typed one is an accurate document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I haven't checked that because I didn't have the original, but I will read from the original.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is difficult, we only have CC here which is the copy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I will compare it Chairperson, and inform the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, so that we don't put to the witness what may not be accurate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It reads here</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a>"... On the 17th of July 1992 I was in my home, at above address, watching television."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you perhaps have a copy of this for the Interpreters, an extra one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, what he is doing now, he is reading from the statement that you are supposed to have made to the Police, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Strydom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I am not sure if the first paragraph was interpreted, I will just start over.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>"... On the 17th of July 1992, I was in my home at the above address, watching television.  The time was 22H20."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a>	That is twenty past ten.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>"...  I heard a noise outside and went to the window.  I saw a group of people carrying television, video's and suitcases.  The group were moving out of the location in the direction of the Faraday Road."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a>	I see you shaking your head, do you want to comment at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> If given a chance, yes, I can talk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, what are your comments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom, what will be helpful to the witness if perhaps, I don't know do you intend reading the whole statement first before getting him to comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No Chairperson, I will read portions and ask questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think you should do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.   I have read to you this first portion and I saw you start shaking your head.  What is wrong with this statement so far?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not accept the word or the name Faraday, there is no Faraday Street in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Apart from that, would you say the rest is in order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That name is incorrect, therefore I conclude that the person who took the statement must have written all false information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So because there is one mistake, you say the rest must be false, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Faraday is far away.   He cannot bring Faraday to Boipatong, that is not it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We understand that, but so that we can move faster, listen to the question and answer the question.  What Counsel is asking you is, simply because there is reference to Faraday Road which is incorrect, are you saying the rest of the statement is incorrect?  Do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I cannot, Faraday is in Vanderbijlpark and therefore I cannot talk about Vanderbijlpark when I am in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Answer the question, what he wants to find out is just because Faraday Road is wrong, are you saying the rest of the statement or everything that is in the statement, is wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I will be very, very choosy so that I admit to things that I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What is stated here is that the group were moving out of the location in the direction of the Faraday Road.  In relation to your house, would you say moving out would be in the direction of Faraday or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought his evidence was that there is no Faraday Road in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, well that is the point, I am not saying - I don't think the statement states it is in Boipatong, it is just in the direction of Faraday.  Can you indicate in relation to your house, where is Faraday, is that outside the township or where is Faraday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know a road called Faraday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is this road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> From the Traffic Department you proceed towards that direction, this one is Frikkie Meyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Frikkie Meyer, yes, and where is Faraday Road in relation to this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It starts at the circle and proceed towards that direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Am I correct in stating that Faraday Road is somewhere close to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It is very far.  Faraday is very far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If you refer to the Traffic Department, do you refer to the testing ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It is Faraday this side and Frikkie Meyer that side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is it close to the testing grounds, because I know where the testing ground is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The testing ground is nearer, closer to Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what he wants to find out is in relation to the Traffic Department, where is this Faraday Road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It is all close by.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What is more important is that it is stated here that you went to the window because you heard a noise, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You did not go to the window to go and have a look at the vehicle outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, when I heard the noise and I looked out the window, I saw the vehicle parked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what he wants to find out is what is it that caused you to go to the window to look outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I heard a noise, that is why I went to look out through the window.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The question is what noise did you hear?  What kind of noise did you hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was just people making a noise, I did not understand whether it was people who were singing or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At that stage, was the "koyoco" already there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I said when it left that road, it went straight to Amatola.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Counsel is doing here, he is going through with you the statement that you made to the Police we are told.  This is just the beginning of the statement where you are recounting what you saw and heard.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He has read to you a portion of the statement in which you say "I heard the noise outside and I went to the window".  Do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what I want to find out is when you went to the window, was the "koyoco" already there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, it was parked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Had the "koyoco" gone away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not understand, please repeat.  Please repeat that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You told us that when you heard the noise, you then went to the window.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I would like to know when you went to the window, was the Police vehicle, the "koyoco" still parked there or had it already left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was still parked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So just to have everything clear, the first thing you saw, was the "koyoco", then you heard noise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Then you moved to the window?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No.   When I heard the noise, I went to the window.  As I looked through the window, I noticed that the "koyoco" was parked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So you could not see the "koyoco" from where you were sitting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was able to see, but I went to the window because of the noise and I still saw it parked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The first time you saw the "koyoco" was when you went to the window, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, as I understand his evidence, what he is saying is that whilst sitting down, he could see the "koyoco".  He heard the noise and then went to the window and when he went to the window, the "koyoco" was still there.  Is that what you are saying Mr Baloyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In your evidence in chief when Mr Berger asked you questions, you testified as follows in relation to the "koyoco", you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a>"... it moved off, thereafter there was a noise in the street.  I didn't see anything, I just heard the noise.  And then I saw a large group of people."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a>	How do you explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am only relating what I know.  Bafokeng Street is a big road, it is a long road so that when there is some commotion, you would hear the noise.  I first saw the "koyoco" and then when I heard the noise, I went to investigate through the window and I still saw that "koyoco" parked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The "koyoco" was still parked there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, even right now, I can take you to show you exactly where it had been parked.  It even travelled on my garden.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We understand that there was a "koyoco" there, but all that he wants to find out is whether when you went to the window and you heard the noise, was it still there, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, it was still there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I also want clarity about one aspect, you say the "koyoco" was right in front of your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not quite get you, do you mean in front of the house or in front of the garden?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In the street but opposite your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was not parked on the street, but on my lawn, that very same lawn that I had been watering.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Just next to your fence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know how to explain it to you, you do not know the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I have been there over lunch time, I know exactly.  Was it next to your fence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, very close.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So it must have been very close to your window, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I mentioned before, it is not just one window that faces the street, there are three windows facing the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If I put to you that the "koyoco", if it was parked on your lawn, and you were inside the house, the "koyoco" was approximately this distance I am from you, from you at that stage, very close?</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, exactly where you are seated, that was the distance.   The window would be where I am seated and the lawn will be in between.  Behind where you are, would be the street and at the wall at the back there, would be the Nqwani and Buwa households.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.  So just for record purposes, I estimate this to be about five paces, five metres approximately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From where you are up to where Mr Baloyi is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, maybe six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It can't be six paces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I would have thought it is about half the distance we measured before, which would make it about seven and a half to ten.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I would have thought so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Ten?  Well, I am a runner and to cover ten metres, is a long distance, but I will measure it during the interval and place the correct distance on the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But in any event, what I want to put to you at such close range, you must have seen who the occupants were if there were any people in the vehicle at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I want to tell you straight, what you are saying is not true.  If a person is inside a "koyoco", you cannot identify them, you can tell maybe that they are black or white, but you cannot tell the identity with accuracy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But can you say the people in the "koyoco", were they black or white?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> If I were to say to you they were white, what would you say, because there were white people inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So you saw white people inside the "koyoco", is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is not what I said in the statement, I said it was a "koyoco", I did not specify whether it was white people or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no, Mr Baloyi, please answer the question.  If you can say whether there were white people or black people inside the "koyoco", tell  us, if you don't know, say so, it is not going to help you to argue with Mr Strydom.  We expect you to give evidence here because that is what you said you wanted to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> This is my response, the people that I saw were seated in front of the "koyoco" and they were white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why did you state earlier on that you could not see the people in the "koyoco"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am referring you to the occupants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There were people at the front and there were people at the back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I could see the people in the front, but not the people at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, his evidence Mr Strydom is that he couldn't see clearly the people that were at the back, but he can state that those who were in front, were white people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And you still maintain that over that distance, you could not identify the colour of the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> You have to pardon me, I am not in a position to state the colour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When you looked through the window and you saw the people for the first time, what were they doing?  I am referring now to the attackers, not the people at the "koyoco" vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That large crowd of people were carrying items and they were headed towards the hostel.  Some of them went into the Nqwani and Buwa households.  After they left the Nqwani household, they came to my home, my home was the last house that was attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> These people, can you identify them, how do you identify them, what can you tell the Committee about them, apart from that they carried stuff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I was not concentrating on what they looked like, what they wore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What were they wearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Which people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The people who carried the televisions and the hi-fi's and the other goods.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were in private clothing, some were wearing over-all's, different types of clothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did they have any distinctive markings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What marks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did they wear something similar amongst the group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I said they were in different types of clothing, the people who entered my home, were the ones who had been wearing headbands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The people that entered your house, were they wearing white or red headbands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I responded to that question, I said they had on red headbands, but their clothing I cannot really comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, and the group outside you already said that the only people you could identify with headbands, were the people that came into your house, so I can gather from that that the people from outside didn't have headbands on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Some of them did have them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The witness said the only people he saw with headbands, were the people who came into his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, he never said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He just answered you that some of them had and some of them didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.  The people outside, the group you saw with the goods, can you describe their headbands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I said the people on the street were carrying different items, TV's and the like, some were wearing headbands and some were not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, those people outside who wore the headbands, can you describe those headbands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I said those headbands were red in colour and moreover there isn't, there was no time to check on what every person was wearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The group outside, did you just see black people?  I am not referring to the people at the "koyoco", I am talking about the group with the goods?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The people who were carrying goods, were black.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were there white people in the group amongst the people that carried the goods?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am referring to black people, not white people.  I did not see any white people carrying the goods.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> The question is amongst the black people, were there any white people, it doesn't matter if they were carrying goods or if they were not carrying goods, did you see any white people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There was no white person amongst the group that were carrying goods.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There is a group of people that you saw when you looked through the window, some of them carried certain items, you mentioned televisions and you mentioned clothing.  In that group of people that you saw, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there any white people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I just saw the people who were carrying the goods, but there were people who were walking along the sides of the road who had been wearing balaclavas, but I could not tell whether they were whites or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you personally see any white people when you looked through the window?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You mentioned something about balaclavas, can you just tell us more what you saw about balaclavas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Those were the people who had been walking on the sides of the streets, but I cannot really comment on them, because I did not see them properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Again I want to refer you to your statement, it is written here</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a>"... the group of people was made up out of blacks and whites.  The white people had balaclavas on and everybody in the group had white bands around their heads."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a>	What do you say about this allegation that the group was made up out of blacks and whites?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying there were people who walked along the streets, who did not go into the premises.  I stated that those could have been white people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But you did not know if they were white people, why would you have stated that that could have been white people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> When they were still at Buwa's household, a "koyoco" approached from kwaMadala and a white Police Officer came in the company of a black Officer and they were loading a dead body onto a Police vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And this white man, he had a balaclava on which covered his face?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are nodding, I want to hear whether it is yes or no.  This white man was wearing a balaclava which covered his face?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Baloyi, you are referring to a vehicle that came after the attack, that removed the body of a person, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We were very busy, trying to take the people who had been injured away, it returned, one "koyoco" returned to collect the dead body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why do you say the "koyoco" returned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was coming from the hostel and we were standing outside.  We were not in the house, we were outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> How do you know it is the same "koyoco" that came back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> All "koyoco's" are the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So therefore all you can say is a "koyoco" came back, you cannot say it returned or the same one came back, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know.  I think you know better how these vehicles operate or what type they are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I just want to put to you that your evidence in front of this Committee differs from your statement in that you clearly states here that there were blacks and whites and that white people had black balaclavas on and everyone in the group, had white bands around their heads.  Do you have any comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not state that they were wearing white bands.  There were white people around because there were white people in that "koyoco".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, but we are not referring to the people in the "koyoco", we are referring to the people in the group and I am putting to you that you are now trying to get out of this corner by stating now that there were white people in the "koyoco".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I have stated before that there were people walking along and they were wearing balaclavas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, let me explain this to you - this is what Counsel wants to find out from you, listen carefully to the question.  If you don't understand the question, say so.  You have now told us that the group that you saw when you looked through the window, part of that group was walking on the side and that some of those people who were walking on the side, wore balaclavas.  Do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you couldn't see whether they were white or black, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You confirmed that you did not, when you looked through the window, see any white person amongst the group, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The ones who are walking in the middle of the street, yes, there was no white person amongst them, but the ones who were walking on the sides, I am not sure whether they were white or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you yourself did not see any white either in the group or on the side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not see any white person, but when ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Shall I finish the question first because I haven't finished the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not see white people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now in the statement that  Counsel has just read to you, you say the group that you saw, was made up of black people and white people.  Do you understand the question so far?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what he wants you to explain is, if from what you have told us you did not see white people in the group, those who were walking along the side, wore balaclavas and you couldn't see whether they were white or black, why then did you say in your statement the group that you saw, consisted of whites and blacks?  Do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, so what is the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> My response is this - when I saw that white person who came later to collect the dead body, I realised that those people who had been walking alongside the road, must have been white too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When you later saw the people that came to fetch the body, how many white people did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I said there was one white person and a black Police Officer, so there were two in total.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That white person, was he wearing a balaclava?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I have already mentioned, he was wearing a balaclava.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now one further aspect ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just before, the white man who returned, is that the one who went to - is it the - Buwa's residence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Please repeat that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am sorry, as I understand your evidence, the reason why you say - you said in your statement there were white people in the group - is because later on, after the attack, you saw a "koyoco" driven by a white man who wore a balaclava and this is the "koyoco" which had come to collect a body as  I understand it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was this body being fetched from, is it from the Buwa's residence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> From the Radebe household.  It is the Hlubi household.  That house is sixth from my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Not the Buwa household?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, Buwa's household is opposite mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I am saying it is not the Buwa household, it is some other household?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is it from the house on the corner where Hlubi and Bafokeng Streets meet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No.  From my home, you go down Bafokeng Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is that house in Bafokeng Street, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, it is in Bafokeng Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> 722 Bafokeng Street, is that the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> 732?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> 722?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So you never told the person who took the statement that the group had white bands.  Can you give any indication where the statement taker will get that information from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The Police could not be trusted at that time, they will do as they pleased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So what you are saying is that the Police wrote here white bands, whilst you told them red bands, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I told them that they were red bands, if they wrote white, who was going to dispute that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Counsel is trying to find out from you and again, let me please ask you to answer the question directly, he has all the right to ask you these questions, if you know the answer you will tell us the answer, if you don't know the answer, say you don't know the answer.  What he is putting to you is because you didn't tell the Police that the attackers wore white bands, did the Police of their own accord, simply wrote white bands when you had told them red bands?  That is the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I told them that I saw them wearing red headbands, some of them did not have them on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You testified earlier that this statement was read back to you, why didn't you correct the statement or the words "white bands"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I stated before that Police questioned me on many issues, so it is possible that they may not have understood some of what I told them and they wrote whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Baloyi, isn't the situation that when you saw the attackers, that you also went to hide yourself and therefore you didn't see much?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I would have not gone to hide, because I do not know if I was going to die or not.  I just wanted to protect my family, it did not matter whether I died or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What kind of weapons did you see amongst the group that was outside your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Which group are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> We are talking about the group of attackers, the people that you saw outside, carrying certain goods, some with red bands, I am referring to that group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Most of them had spears in their possession, and home made axes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is that the only kind of weapons that you saw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, those are the only weapons that I did witness for myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In your statement it is stated here</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a>"...  they also had panga's, spears, axes, knopkieries and big, long firearms with them."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a>	Would that be incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not see any firearm with regards to the group that was walking along the street.  The ones who were walking alongside the street, they were carrying long firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If I refer to the group, I refer to all the people outside, that were walking on the side of the road, in the middle of the road, the totality of people outside the house, excluding people that could have been in the "koyoco".  If I refer to the group, I refer to that group.  What kind of weapons did they have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I saw spears, home made axes, the people who were walking on the side of the road had firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What kind of firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know anything about big firearms, I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> The interpretation was not complete, he mentioned that it was, the firearms, they were carrying them facing upwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you get that Interpreters?  Adv Sigodi says that the firearms were pointed upwards when they were carrying them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Yes, we do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> We beg your pardon for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know an AK47 rifle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I normally see the Police and soldiers carrying firearms, but I cannot tell what type they are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And the kind the people were carrying that were walking on the sides, would you say that is the kind that you know see as an AK47 or won't you be able to say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They just carried long firearms and they were wearing black tracksuits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you say that all the people that walked on the side, were wearing black tracksuits?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were not many, I just saw a few.  There was no time to start counting them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> How many people would you estimate formed the total group, that now again, if I refer to group, that is people in the street, on the sides, the total group, how many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There could have been 500.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And you told the Police when the Police took the statement, that the group consisted out of approximately 500 people, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did say that they were about 500, in fact they were more than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And you also told the person who took the statement that you identified Vanana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know that name Vanana, I know him by the name Mtwana Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, but in any event you told the statement taker that the one person you can identify is Mtwana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What I am saying is I told him everything that he came and stood by the gate and called out to my son, he said Dududu, Morene, and he said Lucky, these are the boys that they used to perform the traditional dance with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> All I want to know you told the Police who took the statement, the same information you gave us regarding Mtwana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, as I have just explained it to you, that is what I told them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Excuse me Mr Strydom, who said Morene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was Mtwana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When the statement was read over to you again, didn't you find it strange that that reference to Mtwana Zulu did not appear in that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I would not know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what he wants to put to you is that in the statement that you made to the Police, there is no mention of Mtwana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you give any reason ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know about that, but he did call out to my son.  I told my son to go hide himself.  He called out to three boys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you tell the three boys to go and hide themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> These boys used to dance with him, he used to teach them the traditional dance.  I do not know why he was calling out to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is not the question, the question is when Mtwana called the names of the boys, did you tell them "go and hide yourselves"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> One was at the neighbour's house and the other was further on down at Nqwani's house.  He just called out their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What he wants to know is, when Mtwana Zulu called the names of your two sons, did you tell your two sons to go and hide?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I only told my son Dududu who was with me in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just ask something?  The other two names Morene and Lucky, who are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They are the boys who used to dance, to perform this traditional dance, the Tsongola dance with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Are they your sons or do they belong to other  families, what is the story?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They are not my sons, they are the neighbours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And Dududu is one of your sons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, he is my son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see Mtwana standing outside your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I said he did not stand outside my house, when they come out of Buwa's household, he called out these names.  I was watching them when they attacked these two other houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You already testified Buwa's house is just opposite yours, so he was standing - was he standing in the middle of the street between the two houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He was standing on the lawn and he called out to them, calling Dududu, Lucky, Morene.  We were watching him.  The people were coming out of Victor's house and they proceeded to my gate, which they broke.  The people who came out of Buwa's house, did not come to my house, they just left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I am not talking about other people, I want to know about Mtwana.   Was he standing on your lawn or on Buwa's lawn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He was standing on the Buwa's lawn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And was he facing in the direction of your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He was just calling the names as they were coming out of the gate.  I did not notice which direction he was facing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So you did not see his face, is that what you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying to you right now, I know that you are Mr Strydom, I knew Mtwana from a long time ago and when he got married to that lady who stays in my neighbourhood, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, the question is ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see his face as he was standing at Buwa's lawn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I did see his face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But you said he was not facing you or the direction of your house, how did you manage to see his face?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> If you are facing that direction, would you not be able to see my face?  Would you only be able to see my face if I face you directly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Are you saying you saw him from the side, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I saw him just as I am seeing you now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But I am facing you Mr Baloyi, did you see him as you are seeing me now, that is you saw him face to face or did you see his side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> When he called out Lucky, these three boys were at different houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see the side of Mtwana's face when he called out the names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying that I saw him.  Yes, I saw him whether from the side or in front, but I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But on that day did you see him from his side or from his front of his face?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> If you are looking at me, would you not be able to see what this person looks like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> May I just explain to you Mr Baloyi that as the Chairperson has requested  you that if you answer the questions directly, that will shorten the cross-examination for you, but if you are not doing that, it is going to take long because Mr Strydom would like to get certain information from you.  If you respond immediately, directly as he is asking you, that will enable him to finish the cross-examination earlier.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> If I can ask, were you looking at him from his side or from directly in front of him when he was calling the names?  Were you able to see his face from the front?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I just saw him in front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The other two names, Morene and Lucky, you say they are not your children.  Which houses do they stay at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They are the neighbours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Direct neighbours, that is to say the house directly next to you or lower down the street, or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The last house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The last house in the direction of Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The last house towards Madala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is that Lucky that stays there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Lucky's house is next door to Nqwani's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Which one of the boys stay there then, Morene then, that is at the last house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, Morene stays at the corner.  His surname is Dube.  Lucky stays at a house next door to the Nqwani's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I don't know that house, is it lower down the street in Bafokeng, towards Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I cannot compare Slovo Park with Bafokeng.  They stay in my neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> How many houses from you does Lucky stay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Lucky's house is next door to Nqwani's and my house is in the other direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So is the house on the other side of the street, opposite you?  Just before you answer this, maybe we can shorten this, can you give the number of the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know the number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The question I want to ask you, can you give - I want to put to you that Mtwana was not in Boipatong that night.  Do you want to comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not think that he was absent as a person who was in charge of the hostel, there was no way he was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Are you saying that the reason why you say he was there, is because he won't let those people from kwaMadala go alone, he would go with them, he is a leader?  Is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, as I said before, his in-law's house was also in the area.  They did not go there, just went and attacked my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is not what you are being asked.  It was just put to you now that Mtwana Zulu was not present during the attack and your response was he could not have been absent because he was the leader, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know a person by the name of Moses Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I know the induna who used to stand guard at the gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see him that night of the attack in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I did not see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know what kind of clothes Mtwana was wearing that night, can you give any description?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I did not notice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So what you are saying is that Mtwana shouted the names of Dudu, Morene and Lucky and thereby announcing his presence in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know how to tell you this, I said these people used to be involved in this traditional dance together and we never thought that he was capable of doing this type of act.  We knew very well that it was him who called out to these boys, I saw him clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What I am in fact putting to you is ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just a minute, what do you mean when you say we knew that no other person could have called them, other than Mtwana?  What do you mean when you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As he stood there when he called out to these boys, he is the one person who knew all their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And according to you, he was not hiding the fact that he was in Boipatong because he shouted names of known people to him, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is what surprises me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And when he shouted Dudu's name, you said he must go and hide himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How far does - you mentioned that Mtwana's in-law's lived close to your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, the fourth house from mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is Mtwana Zulu known in and around your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Even a  young child knows him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Can I just clarify something?  When you saw Mtwana Zulu and when you heard him calling out to your son, was this after your house had been attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was before it was attacked.  That is why I saw them clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And how many people, how far were the attackers when you saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The crowd that had been carrying goods, was all over the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So the crowd that was carrying the goods, how far was it from your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Some distance away, but not too far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> How far were they from Mtwana's in-law's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were near, I can say they were about the fourth house away.  That is the estimate I can give, but they went into Nqwani and Buwa's households.  When they came out of these houses, they joined the other group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> How many people were in the street, was the street full of people at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I estimated, there were 500 or more, there were many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I know that there were many people, but how far were they from your house, were they already opposite your house or were they still coming towards your house when you saw Mtwana, at the time when you saw Mtwana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> they were still approaching.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> How many people were in the street opposite your house when you saw Mtwana Zulu?  I am not talking about the attackers, I mean how many people were there in that vicinity where Mtwana Zulu was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I saw them as they were approaching, there were many of them.    At that time I was watching them as they were attacking the Nqwani and Buwa households.  That is before the other group arrived.   After they had finished the attack on these two households, they left carrying goods.  When the people left Nqwani's household, they came to my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Listen carefully, we know from your evidence that there were approximately 500 people going passed your house that evening, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We also know that there were people who were walking along the side of the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I think there five or four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What my colleague wants to find out from you is, at the time when you saw Mtwana Zulu, how many people approximately were in front of your house, do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I do understand you now.  I was not in a position to count them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You told us, we know, that at least those who were walking along the side were approximately five, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, that were in there, were they five, ten or was the street full of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The just broke windows and did not get into the house.  I am not in a position to say how many they were.  That is when I started to see Mtwana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's take this step by step, you have said you now understood what the question was, right, what I explained to you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What my colleague wishes to know, approximately how many people would you say were in front of your house at the time when you saw Mtwana Zulu?  Do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We understand that at about that time, people had already started attacking the houses, Victor Nqwani's house, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And there were people in Buwa's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you saw Mtwana after these two houses had been attacked, is that right or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now when you saw Mtwana Zulu in front of your house, approximately how many people were in the road next to your house, do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.  The other group had not as yet arrived, it was just the people who had gone into the houses.  There could have been five people each who went into these houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, must I carry on at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am sure you are about to finish?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, about this Mtwana issue, just two questions basically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I mean your cross-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Unfortunately not Chairperson.  There are certain other aspects I will have to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I hope thereby limiting my learned friend's cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you just carry on and at a convenient point, will you let us know, then we will rise at that point.  Do you want to close this Mtwana aspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, let me do that.  Do you then say that Mtwana was also one of the people that went into the houses opposite you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am not saying he attacked those houses, I just saw him outside there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you first recognise his voice or did you first see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We were standing by the window watching him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what he wants to find out is what is it that made you recognise Mtwana?  Is it because you first saw him or is it because you first heard his voice?  Do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I first heard his voice, thereafter I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If I put to you that there is a chance that you are making a mistake because the light was not good, you were looking from inside the house and add to that, that I put to you that Mtwana was not there, isn't there a possibility that you are making a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying it was not dark, there was sufficient light, it was as bright as daylight.  It was at night, but the lights are very bright.  It is as if it is daylight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you heard his voice, you were standing next to your window and looking through the window?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, we were watching as they were attacking those two houses.  As the windows were being broken in those two houses, we were watching.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it was whilst you were standing there, that you heard his voice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.  When they left Buwa's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, were you inside or outside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was inside, in the sitting room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And did you have the lights on in the house or were your lights switched off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The lights were switched off inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you have your windows opened or closed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We made sure that the windows were closed in such a way that if you are outside, you cannot open the window, but we could still hear what the people outside were saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But wasn't there a lot of noise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I mentioned before, the noise was coming from Bafokeng Street, there was a big noise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And this crowd that was coming, that was about four to six houses away from you, this large crowd, were they not making a lot of noise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I think the people who making the noise, could have been the residents.  I am not sure whether it was the attackers or the residents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Were they singing or chanting or did you notice anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, it sounded like people were screaming, but it was a noise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> It was coming closer to your house, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> We have heard evidence that the attackers were shouting (indistinct), did you hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, they did say that and they also said kill the dogs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> When did you hear this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As they were near Buwa's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And you were inside the house, you could hear this whilst you were inside the house with your windows closed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I mentioned before, we closed the windows, but in such a way that you could still hear what people were saying outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> How far was Mtwana Zulu from your house when you heard him calling out to your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Do you see that wall, would you not be able to see a person that far away?  You can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Could you hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have a lot of pacing to do Mr Strydom, would you pace this distance which the witness has indicated.  Did you say it is from where you are sitting to that wall, there where there is a red and black curtain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, where there is that (indistinct), I don't know whether it is a stove or something else.  Yes, I even see someone there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it is the distance from where you are sitting to that wall over there behind the legal representative for the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, the street will be in between, Bafokeng Street was in between.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So that would be about ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I will do the measurement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> This dancing with the boys - sorry are you  just busy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I just wanted to clarify the hearing aspect, and you say that they had started stoning the windows at Nqwani's house and at Buwa's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> At what stage did Mtwana Zulu call out to your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> When they emerged from Buwa's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did he also come out from Buwa's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know, I just saw him standing on the lawn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And you could hear him quite clearly calling out your son and the other two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not doubt that for a minute.  That is my son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At that stage, wasn't your son hiding already with your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were still standing next to the kitchen and I told him that he should now go and hide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> This dancing that your son did with Mtwana, was that at the stage he already stayed at the hostel, or was that still when he lived at Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> This dance started a long while ago, many children in the township were taught.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So is the answer Mtwana was still living in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> You would not know whether he lived in Boipatong or not, because sometimes he would be there at Bafokeng Street until such time that he got his own house at Majola Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you saw him on that day, when last had you seen him, could you recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They didn't use to come to the township any more, because they were afraid of being killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And the kids, your child and the other children, didn't go to kwaMadala hostel either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, they no longer went to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you tell your wife that you saw Mtwana outside your house on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What I said is that she would not confirm or say that she saw him, but she did hear his voice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did she tell you that she heard his voice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We were standing together there, she heard his voice very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If she heard the voice, did she also see him then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know, I cannot comment on whether she him or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> This is a very important aspect, surely you would have discussed this afterwards?  Did she tell you I saw Mtwana standing in the street like you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What we discuss is different from what we saw.  All I can say is that I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I will conclude by stating that your wife didn't say anything when she testified about Mtwana Zulu outside your house, she didn't say that she heard his voice, she didn't say that she saw him, she didn't say that you told her that he was outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What I am saying is that many people who know what happened, are unwilling to come before this Committee because they are afraid that they would be killed by the Police.  She herself used her discretion in deciding what she told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Baloyi, I don't want to argue with you, but I can understand if she was afraid to mention the Police, but why would she hide the name of Mtwana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Will this be a convenient stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Baloyi, you will have to come back tomorrow for further questions.  Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I will be present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will rise and we will reconvene at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>
