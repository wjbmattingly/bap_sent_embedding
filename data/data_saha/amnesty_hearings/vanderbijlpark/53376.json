The issue here is whether the people that you represent meet the criteria set out in the Act for the granting of the amnesty.  I can understand if the essence of the application is to ensure that you get information in order to deal with the issue of full disclosure which is an issue here which arises from the presence or otherwise of the police during the day of the massacre, but this is not the forum to challenge the Commission Report.  If you want to challenge that Report you've got to go to some - this Committee has no jurisdiction to hear that matter, but what we can do is to hear that evidence surrounding the issues relevant to whether or not there has been full disclosure.

You are an extension of that body, brings in my argument of the reasonable suspicion of bias.  Now, in order to make a value decision on this, based on all the facts, we say on behalf of the applicants, please supply us with information whereafter we can make a value decision whether or not to ask for your recusal.  An important aspect would be the - the most important aspect - if yourself or any Member of the Committee formed part of those deliberations, with respect, it means that you were privy to a finding already on record, detrimental and prejudicial to my client's application and one of two things should then happen and I'm not asking you to rule on that yet because we're not there but the argument will go the relevance hereof is the following.
