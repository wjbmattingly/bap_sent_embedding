Statements which I'm going to use to cross-examine this witness has been handed to all the parties on Friday so I will continue with my cross-examination and in due course that bundle will be ready.  So the statements I'm referring to are statements made by this witness, Miriam Molete and a statement made by Florence Molete.  I was informed the party has been handed these documents.
