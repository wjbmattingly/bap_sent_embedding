<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Good morning ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this continuation of the hearings.  We apologise for commencing somewhat late.  As is always the case, it is somewhat difficult to commence on time during the first date of the hearing, but we hope we will make up for the lost time by sitting until late and starting at 9 o'clock as from tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	Yes, Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I call my first applicant, Vincent Khanyile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, before my learned friend calls Mr Khanyile, might I please be allowed to make a formal application.  The application concerns a person by the name of Andries Nosenga who has made application ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't hear anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who has made application for amnesty for his part in the Boipatong massacre and who is not presently before the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>	According to the contents of a draft affidavit which was apparently annexed to his amnesty application, he has a version which is radically different from the version of the applicants presently before the Committee.  In particular in our submission Chairperson, the contents of Mr Nosenga's application and in particular the evidence that he might give before this Committee are essential for the purposes of cross-examination.  We need to know exactly what it is that he is going to say to the Committee so that we can cross-examine the remaining applicants.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>	It also might happen Chairperson, that once the applicants have heard Mr Nosenga, and in particular what he says in his affidavit, that they might change their versions or might not, or amplify their versions.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>	We would ask that Mr Nosenga's application be heard before the other applicants because, in our submission, if it is not it will necessitate the recall of each and every one of the applicants after Mr Nosenga has given his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you finished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>	Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I can simply report that I've set in motion arrangements to get Mr Nosenga to the hearings.  He is currently in prison at Vereeniging and steps have been taken this morning to get him here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>	Mr Chairman, I would submit that in the normal course he would still have to be enrolled, as yet he is not before the Committee.  We don't know at this stage whether he is represented by anyone and obviously we would have to make those enquiries as well Mr Chairman.  	Mr Chairman, it is my view that we should proceed with the hearing subject obviously to Mr Nosenga being enrolled, whether that occur later this afternoon or tomorrow.  I submit that whoever is being questioned can be questioned or recalled on that specific aspect.  I submit there would be no prejudice in that situation, in other words that the proceedings proceed until Mr Nosenga has in fact enrolled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Chairperson, Mr Nosenga's application is not before the Committee at this stage and I can see no basis upon which we must delay the proceedings pending his enrolment.  The fact of the matter is that the legal representative for the family can put the version of Mr Nosenga to the various applicants and they can answer to that version at this stage.  So I ask that the proceedings carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairman, I fully agree with my learned friend, Mr Strydom, because Mr Mthembu has already given his evidence and it will not have any bearing on him but we only have an unsigned affidavit by this said Nosenga at this stage so I don't even think there's a proper ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR FREDERICH:</span> I have no submissions in this regard Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, if I could just place on record that we deliberately did not go into the details of what occurred in Boipatong on the night of the massacre, so as far as putting a version to the applicants, it would of necessity be selective and might not necessarily be full.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>MICROPHONES SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger who appears on behalf of the victims has made an application to the effect that an amnesty application by one, ...[indistinct] Matanzima Nosenga, to which is annexed an unsigned affidavit, be heard prior to the remaining applications being heard.  	The application by Mr Nosenga is not before us in the sense that it has not been enrolled.  All we have is an unsigned affidavit by him and the application for amnesty which has also been handed to us is incomplete, it doesn't have the signature page, although it does appear from the application itself that it was given an application number, that is 2778 of 1996.  We've been informed by Mr Prior that arrangements have now been made to bring Mr Nosenga to these hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>	It seems to us that until such time that Mr Nosenga is here, confirms the contents of his application, it would be inadvisable to delay these proceedings.  Accordingly, we will proceed with the evidence of the remaining applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I will ask that Mr Khanyile be sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Khanyile, could we have your full names for the record please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Vincent Kusahusa Khanyile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">VINCENT KUSAHUSA KHANYILE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>	Mr Khanyile, you have signed a form applying for amnesty in terms of Section 18 of the Amnesty Act, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In front of you you have that form, can you just confirm your signature on the last page thereof?  That appears on page 95 of the fist bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, it is mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Also annexed to this form appears two pages that provide for certain answers to certain questions contained in that form, do you confirm the contents thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you referring to pages 96 and 97?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Indeed so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>	Then certain further particulars were requested and that request appears on page 98 and 99 of the bundle, and I want your answer to confirm the correctness of further particulars contained on page 101 and 102 of the bundle.  Were those the answers you gave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And then I want to refer you to an affidavit contained from page 103 to 106 of the bundle. If you can firstly look at page 106, do you confirm your signature on that document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now this statement, or did you have insight into this statement again before you started testifying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you confirm that contents thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now I want to return to the application as contained in Form 1 and I want to refer you to the answer to questions 10(a).  You have an Afrikaans copy in front of you and I will read in Afrikaans</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>"Meld politieke oogmerk wat bereik wou word"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>The answer to that question is contained on page 96.  I am going to read certain portions to you and I want further comment on what is stated here.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>"Die politieke oogmerk wat bereik wou word met die aanval op Boipatong was om die oorwegend ANC beheerde en gesinde Boipatong 'n les to leer en om meer spesifiek die 'Self-defence Units' van die ANC te neutraliseer.  Die rede daarvoor was die vyandige gesindheid wat geheers het tussen die IFP en die ANC gesinde 'Self-defence Units'"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>Mr Khanyile, can you at this stage just give us your comments on what is stated here, especially with regard to the problems between the ANC and the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I do agree with what has been read, but what I don't know is I'm not too sure if the advocate expects me to explain about the enmity as to why they were our enemies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, that's the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Okay.  I will first explain and say the beginning of the problem was in July when we had a rally at the stadium at Zone 7.  When we came back from the rally we discovered that anyone who spoke Zulu, that was the day upon which they will be killed.  From there, on the 22nd of July, we were not able to go back to our places or to our homes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>	A person left his home or her home without anything.  Our possessions were confiscated from us. Even those who were selling such things like fridges, such stock was confiscated from them and the cars were burnt as well.  It was evident that we had no place of refuge.  	From there we ran away to the office, to the Zulu Government in Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can I just stop you here, which office do you refer to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I'm referring to the office that was representing the Zulu nation which was in Vereeniging.  The leader there or the head there was Vivian Velase(?) of the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was that an IFP office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, it was because everything that had to do with IFP we did it from that office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were you a member of the IFP at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you hold any office with the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, I held no office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Will you then continue from where you went to this office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just before you do, if I could just clarify something, you were going very quickly unfortunately and I didn't pick up everything.  You mentioned a date and I didn't catch it very clearly, was it the 22nd of July, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Was that the date of the rally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So from that date onward things got bad for  you, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I'm trying to explain that as from the 22nd or as from the 22 onwards, the situation got volatile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What year was that?  That is the other thing I just wanted to check.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It was 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Just another clarification, you started by saying it was an office for KwaZulu government but you ended up agreeing that it was an IFP office, I want to get clarity on that.  What type of office was it, was it the office for the IFP political party or was it the office which was representing the KwaZulu government like it was done in the olden days, that every homeland would have an office in the urban areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> What I could be in a position to explain would be, if that is true, it was an office representing the KwaZulu Government, yet the IFP activities as well would be addressed there.  Like the IFP members, the majority were Zulus and everything would be discussed and addressed from the very same office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Perhaps I could just assist.  Mr Mvelasi, I have a recollection somewhere the he was the Urban Representative of the KwaZulu Government, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you just please continue with your evidence, from where you went to this office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.  The Interpreter has a problem, the speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Please just hold on, there's a small technical problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>PROBLEMS WITH SOUND EQUIPMENT</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> From there hell broke loose.  As we were workers we were harassed and the majority of us, as the office was not too big or was small, it became clear and evident that we can not occupy the office, all of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>	The life that we led was traumatic because we had to seek refuge in some bush nearby Sasol, where a white man sympathised with us and we came across, or we met the Red Cross workers and they erected some tents for us so we were able to have comfort and we attributed all of that to the white man who helped us with the place of refuge.	</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>	From there we continued in the same state or conditions that we were being harassed and people were burnt all over the Vaal triangle or were set alight.  In fact, if you were speaking Zulu you would definitely be killed.  If you had an affair with a Zulu man you would definitely be killed.  If you were seen anywhere talking to a Zulu person you would be killed, no doubt about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>	If your neighbour hated you so much, maybe you had beautiful things or admirable things, he would tell on you to the comrades and claim that you were Inkatha and therefore you will be killed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>	The Zulu kids who were children or whose parents were Inkatha members, from 1990 they never went to school, they lost education.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When did you move into the kwaMadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> After we left that place of refuge we found a place called kwaMadala Hostel, it was towards the end of October 1990.  We discovered a place that was not occupied and we did not even ask anyone or from anyone, we just decided to occupy that place with no permission from anybody.  That is how we entered the kwaMadala Hostel in October 1990.  That went on, the harassment went on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>	As we were still at kwaMadala Hostel, we were ordinary workers and we were never able to have transport that could take us or that could transport us from the hostel to work.  People who did try to transport us to work were terrified and they left us alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you just give the Committee more information about the people that went to kwaMadala Hostel, who were they, who did they sympathise with and to which political party did they belong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I will try to explain in this fashion:  When all of this went on, the killing of people or the killing of Zulu-speaking people, there was a rumour	 that came from the ANC structures that was forwarded to their members, to the ANC members that is, that they should leave the word that says: "We are killing Zulus" because there as people in KwaZulu that are Inkatha as well and that word was left alone.  Instead there was a precise statement that they were killing Inkatha people, not necessarily the Zulus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>	I would say the people who were at kwaMadala Hostel were the IFP members, the majority was Zulu-speaking people or the Zulus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now you refer to the Zulu people that were killed, who killed them, according to your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> According to my knowledge we were being killed by the ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In your application you refer to: "Self-defence Units", can you just tell the Committee more about these units?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The Self-defence Unit was a group of youths which ordained itself as a group of warriors and going out or they deployed themselves to kill the IFP members and to set the houses of IFP members alight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Reference is also made to: "comrades" in your application, were they the same group or a different group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I mean the same group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now during the time that you stayed in kwaMadala Hostel, did you have any personal experiences of attacks on your own life or people with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't quite understand your question, would you please repeat it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Whilst staying at kwaMadala Hostel, did you move out of the hostel into Boipatong township or any township for that matter, and experience any problems yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, I never left kwaMadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know a person by the name of Bongani Mbatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I do know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you tell the Committee what happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Bongani Mbatha was arrested in Boipatong location and I was with him at the time.  If I'm not mistaken I think we were about 10 in number, a group of 10, that is.  We were at a tavern by the name of, I believe it's Checkers or Trekkers Tavern ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker is not too sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> When we were still there in that jubilant mood we heard that noise outside and we got outside to see and we realised that the situation had changed and we tried to go back to the place, or to our home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>	As it was still the situation we realised that there was an attack going on.  We saw a police van and we enlisted some help from them, in a sense that we wanted a lift with the police in their van and they refused us a lift and they said we should follow them instead, walk behind the van until they had escorted us outside the location but it did not happen like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>	As people were grouping and gathering the police also left us alone.  They threw stones at us, and that was the beginning of the attack.  Fortunately Mr Mbatha got hold of a stick on the ground.  As the person who had something one like a jacket I advised him to put that stick right inside his jacket, to hide it so to speak and pretend as if he is drawing out a gun from his jacket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>	We tried to walk upwards towards the taxi rank and the people were following us, throwing stones at us, back and forth that is.  When I realised that we were seriously being attacked and that in no time they would get hold of us and we will be captured, I pretended as if I'm drawing something from my jacket, like a gun and they made way or they gave way to us.  We were able now to run away, to escape from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>	They never gave up, they still ran after us.  I consistently pretend as if I'm drawing a gun out of my jacket.  Unfortunately as we were about to gain exit, Mr Mbatha was hit and he fell on the ground instantly.  We took off, we left him because we could not help him in any way.  He was stabbed by stakes or the garden equipment.  He was injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>	One thing that pains me is that he was hit just before we were saved because we were just about to escape completely from the group.  He was assaulted severely and they tried to pour paraffine on his body and the police emerged immediately and they helped him or they took him with.  That is how far I know inasfar as Mbatha's case is concerned.</p>

The reason we got to hear was that he was attacked simply by being a Zulu and observing the Zulu rituals.</p>

<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> This means the fact that I was trying to explain was the ANC couldn't have done anything at liberty, we were also expected or supposed to show them that we are people as well and we are capable of doing what they were doing, the acts of violence as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What was the general feeling amongst the residents of the kwaMadala Hostel prior to the attack, in relation to the killings that were ongoing?</p>

<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I did not quite understand this part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> According to you, at that stage who was supporting the Self-defence Units?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The community at large in the Vaal triangle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Would that include the Boipatong community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You also make mention of some kind of attack that was launched by the community or the Self-defence Units from Boipatong on kwaMadala Hostel, can you just tell us more about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> What I would say is, the attack of kwaMadala Hostel was by the Vaal Triangle at large.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But was there any specific attack in the full sense of the word, on kwaMadala Hostel, or might I say attempted attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It happened many times.  I do trust and hope that there is no-one who doesn't this because it became a practise that people kept saying they are going to attack the kwaMadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> To get to the attack itself, when did you become aware for the first time that an attack was going to take place on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> What I know firstly with regard to Boipatong attack, there was a meeting convened where as a community of kwaMadala Hostel or hostel dwellers we complained to our leaders that why would they be so quiet when we were being harassed and tortured in this manner because those days people who were after us were Boipatong community or Boipatong people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>	The leaders therefore said they understood perfectly well what we were complaining about and they were going to sit down and think over this matter.  There was another meeting that was held.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know when this meeting was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't quite remember but it may happen that it took three weeks prior to the attack.  And again there was a meeting that convened, that I trust it took or it was held a week prior to the attack where Mr Bhekinkosi Mkhize attended and told us that each and every man had to get himself ready or prepared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If I can interrupt you, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> There is something I would like to explain or get straight.  I would like to get this first point straight:  It was not a meeting that was about what I just explained, it was an ordinary meeting, a general meeting, that after the meeting was over we had complaints which were lodged by certain people, forwarded to the leaders ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this the meeting that was held approximately three weeks before the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, I didn't catch your answer there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I did respond.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What was your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I said there was a meeting.  The meeting I'm referring to is the one that took place three weeks prior to the attack, Boipatong that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who were the leaders at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I think I will take this opportunity and explain about the leaders at kwaMadala Hostel.  Firstly there was a committee, a large committee which was referred to as a Senior Committee.  The Chairman of that Committee was Thembikosi Khumalo.  His assistant was Richard Ndwandwa.  The Secretary was Jerome Zuma.  I've forgotten his assistant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who have you forgotten?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The assistant to the Secretary, I've forgotten his name.  The Treasurer was Swenke Buthelezi and his assistant was a man I knew as Ngobese, and the organiser was Gazu.  Gazu is one of those who were killed at Boipatong.  I only recall those from the Senior Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>	We had a Youth Committee.  The Chairman was Nicholas Buthelezi, his assistant was Victor Mthembu.  The Secretary was Matabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Khanyile, would you just speak slowly so that we can make notes of what you're saying.  The Chairperson was Nicholas Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's true.  Matabelo, that is,  his assistant was Tzwee and another one that I knew was Bazooga.  Others I knew them from seeing them but I did not know their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know what the other names of Tzwee are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, I only know that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know what are the other names of Bazooga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, I knew him as Bazooga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You say you knew the others by sight, approximately how many members of that committee were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> According to my knowledge there were eight in each committee.  Senior Committee had eight, as well as the Youth Committee had eight members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Were you a member of any of those committees?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> These committees, were they IFP Committees or hostel committees?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> These committees that I've referred to were IFP Committees, now I am proceeding to the hostel committees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>	We also had another committee that was dealing with the hostel problems.  The committee of the kwaMadala Hostel were also the employees of ISCOR, working in ISCOR.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>	Firstly, the one that was in charge of that place or the area was Mr Moses Mthembu and another man whose name I have forgotten although I remember his surname and he was Kumane and three others who were working as security men who were controlling the entrance and the exit, or the coming in and the going out of people.  One of them was Mr Shohisa and the other was Mr Nthule and Mr Mkwanazi.  These are the ones who were in charge inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>	We also had another committee or maybe the Indunas, they were two only ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> These Induna, they were not part of the house committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No.  ...[No English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, we're not getting any translation.  Mr Khanyile, can you just repeat from the point where you started talking about the Indunas Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Okay.  There were two Indunas, the first Induna was Bhekinkosi Mkhize and his assistant was, I knew him as Mzizi.  Those were the ones who were in charge or who were our leaders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>	Each time we had traditional weapons.  And again there was Vanana Zulu.  Vanana was a Prince.  He had no position that he occupied but as a child from royal family or his is a prince and he was amongst us being the majority Zulus.  We always acknowledged him as our leader.  There is nothing that would take place without consulting him.  That is how the hierarchy was at the kwaMadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>	There's a slight thing that I'm forgetting.  We had also had another committee which dealt with the death.  As we lost so many souls we had a committee that specifically dealt with that, collecting of money for the preparation of funerals, we were just the two of us.  	Myself I was the collector of monies, in fact I was something like a secretary and there was another one that I was working with and he was taken as a chairman of this two-man committee.  I am forgetting his name.  His surname is Mpungosi.  I have forgotten his first name, Mpungosi is his name, I've forgotten his first name.  That is how the hierarchy of leadership was at the kwaMadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In your application you make mention of a person with the name of Damarra Chonco, what was his position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Damarra Chonco, I'm remembering now, he was one of the Senior Committee members.  The ones I have already listed for you, he was one.  He formed part of the Senior Committee.  This was a man whom we knew very well.  We collected the money and he would be in a position to go and buy weapons to protect ourselves, he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want to take you back to the meeting you've mentioned that took place three weeks before the attack.  That is the meeting which you said was a general meeting about some of the residents who started to complain about their situation.  Who was chairing that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Then you made mention of another meeting approximately a week before the attack, what was the nature of that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> This was a meeting just like other meetings we used to hold, but at the end of that meeting Mr Mkhize conveyed a message to the effect that each and every man should be right next to his possessions or should get ready or be prepared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this said at the first or the second meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The second meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you understand him to mean when he said each person must stay near his things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I understood him to be saying the day is close or nearby for revenge or retaliation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what were the people required to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't quite understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That each and every person had to stay near his things, what I want you to tell us is what did you understand him to mean by staying by your things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> According to my understanding, I understood him to be saying that this means the day of revenge is around the corner or is nearby or is approaching closely, because he did not want to expand in his statement or explain in detail but that was my understanding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Apart from the - let me just ask you this, who spoke when he said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who said that you must be close to your things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That was Mr Mkhize who was explaining that we must stay next to our things and get ready and be prepared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is that all that he said in relation to a possible attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that was all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now that was a week prior to the attack because we know that that attack took place on the 17th of June 1992.  Now during the course of that week before the attack, did you hear anything further about this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When was the next occasion that you heard anything about the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It was on Wednesday the 17th, around 8p.m. or 8 at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now just to curtail the proceedings somewhat, I just want to read to you certain portions of your affidavit on page 104, the last paragraph on that page</p>

<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you fetch a weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> What happened is when we went back to our houses to fetch the weapons we went back to the stadium, after we fetched our weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now can you just tell the Committee what happened then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I will say that at the time when Damarra stated that this is the day every man should go and fetch whatever he has in a form of weapons, so to speak.  He explained thereafter that - and the ones who were willing to have in their possession weapons like AK, they can contact him.  I therefore went to the house and I fetched my spear and brought my spear with.  After that I got some traditional herbs or I was given some traditional herbs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is that called: "Ntelezi"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It's called Ntelezi, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see AK47 rifles in the vicinity of the stadium or inside the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I did see them at the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see how they got there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, I only saw them lying on the ground at the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you take an Ak47 rifle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who let the people out to the township, Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Please repeat the last part of your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who let the residents of kwaMadala Hostel out of the hostel towards Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Even though I'm not in a position to say exactly who was leading as I was right at the back, I do trust and hope that it was Mr Mkhize, although I'm not quite sure about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you tell the Committee now in your own words exactly which route was followed and where did you enter Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Well perhaps Mr Khanyile, you should start by telling us what happened after you had been sprinkled with Ntelezi, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> If I remember very well we started chanting some songs and we left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Which route did you follow to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We used the kwaMadala gate which no longer exists.  We went under the bridge.  After passing the bridge we left the tarred road and we took a foot path which turns to your right towards Boipatong.  We passed the main road, we crossed the main road coming from town, which comes from town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Beyond the bridge you took the foot path?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, after passing the bridge we took a small path, a foot path which was on our right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We crossed the main road which comes from Vanderbijl going towards Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is that called: Nobel Boulevard or Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the name of the road Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It's Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, I just want to get clarity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After you crossed the Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, which route did you follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We crossed on a small bridge, it's a small bridge used by pedestrians, we proceeded.  Even if I don't know Boipatong very well, I'm sure that we used a straight street, we entered it to a straight called Sheshwe(?).  I think it is the last street on your right-hand side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, just repeat the name of the street please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I said even if I'm not very much sure, I think it was Moshweshwe Street because it is the last street on your right-hand side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Before the group got to Moshweshwe Street, did you come to a standstill or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I think we did stop under a tree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know why you stopped there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It was going to be clarified that we should enter the place and look around, look for comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did any person give instructions at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I don't remember his name.  We were a big group but there was someone who was giving instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you remember what he said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> As I said I was a bit far, I think I heard him saying that we should enter the township and try to look for the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You made reference to a big group, what is your estimation, how big was that group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> About 350 to 400.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At that stage, in your own mind, what did you think, what were you going to do at Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> There wasn't anything else except killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why did you think that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We were already told in the stadium and we were armed which were arms which were used for killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now I want you to testify further from the way you came along Moshweshwe Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We proceeded along that street as I've explained.  We have to cross a street which comes from Zwandela which proceeds towards the taxi rank near the shops ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the name of the street that you came up to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The only street that I remember well is Moshweshwe.  As you go down Moshweshwe there is a street which comes from Zwandela which crosses and proceeds towards the shops near the taxi rank.  That is where we crossed the street, on our way along Moshweshwe.  We found a lot of comrades around a big fire ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Just before you carry on, I want to refer you to Exhibit J which is a plan of Boipatong, if you can just indicate to the Committee the street where you will find the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I think this is the point where we ...[inaudible] can see Moshweshwe Street going down and the street as I'm pointing, that is the one that crosses Moshweshwe towards the shops near the taxi rank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Maybe just for record purposes, I want to place on record that according to my map it seems to be Lekwa Street, higher up beyond the shops, it's names Lekwa Street.  Lower down it seems to be, ja, also Lekwa Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>	You were testifying about comrades close to a fire, can you just take it from there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes.  As we came closer to them they started shooting towards us and we also shot back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know who fired in your group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Only one person by the name of Damarra, even if it was clear that he wasn't one that was shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At that stage were all the people still together in one group or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was the situation right through the attack or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We ...[inaudible] different way dispersed after the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want you now to testify about what you did and where you went in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After the shooting it was clear that the comrades were running away.  Some retreated towards Slovo Park, some ran up towards the shops.  That is where we divided into two groups which were not under command.  We just ran to two different places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>	I was with the group which proceeded towards the shop.  As the comrades were retreating, jumping fences into the yards, we also dispersed and went in different ways.  Some people went into the houses, some people were running along the streets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>	That is where we started hitting houses, throwing stones at houses.  As others were getting into the houses, others were shooting those who were running away, others were following those who were running away with spears.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During all this did you see Mr Damarra Chonco again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say I was close to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you go into any houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, I didn't get into any houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> All that I did, I threw stones at the houses.  I also met someone who was running away, I stabbed him with a spear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you remember which part of this persons body you stabbed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> As he was running I stabbed him from the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was it a male person or a female?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It was a male person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After you stabbed him, did he fall to the ground or what happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I stabbed him, he fell to the ground.  As he wasn't alone, there were many people running away, I ran after the others.  I think those who were coming from behind me stabbed him too and finished him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Are you able to indicate where you met this person who was running away and you stabbed, in relation to the street or the shops?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say when we started shooting in that fashion I couldn't specifically say as to where these things happened because it was a confused situation and further I don't know Boipatong very well but when I try to recall I think we had already passed the shops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But you were still on Lekwa Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't remember the name of the street where I stabbed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you stab this man shortly after you entered Boipatong or towards the time that you were ready to leave Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It was the time when we were running after those who were retreating, running away.  After we have just started shooting and then they ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now apart from this person did you injure any other person in Boipatong, injure or kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> All the others that I tried to follow, they managed to run away from me.  I just continued breaking windows of houses until we had to go back where we came from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you remember from which street you left Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We used a street which is situated where there is a fence but I don't know the name of the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That street, was it close to where you entered or was it the other side of Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It was not that far from where we entered.  I would say ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Excuse me, he said it was far from where we entered the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, Mr Interpreter, I can't hear you very clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He said it was far, I made a mistake saying it was near.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If I show you ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> If I show you Exhibit J, can you indicate where you left Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It is so difficult for me to follow the map but I will just give directions here.  As we entered, on our right-hand side we went down, down that street.  When we were coming out of the place ...[no further translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You were stating: "Coming out of the place", can you take it from there please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We went out on the side where Boipatong is ...[indistinct] to a fence ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, please just repeat Mr Interpreter, that thing about the fence.  I couldn't hear you as it was indistinct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He said they went out at the place where Boipatong is adjacent to firms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you give a name of one of those firms or two maybe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say Cape Meat as they follow each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know the location of the informal settlement called Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I know the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During the course of the attack did you go into Slovo Park or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I and my group we didn't reach Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see any of the attackers going in that direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would think the other group which went downwards might have reached Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What was the general condition with regard to lights in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Regarding light of Boipatong you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> There was light but it wasn't that good.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What kind of lights were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> There were those, they're Apollo lights.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> How long would you estimate did you spend in Boipatong itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I think it was about one hour and thirty minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> How long would you say it would take, or did it take for the group to get from kwaMadala Hostel to the stage where the group entered Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It will be from 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And did it take the same time to get from Boipatong to kwaMadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, it might have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During the attack did you see Defence Force or Police vehicles in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you at any stage, from the time you left kwaMadala Hostel till the time you returned to kwaMadala Hostel, see any police vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> When we were leaving Boipatong, on that bridge, small bridge which is a pedestrian bridge, there were soldiers cars.  I would say there were two or three.  They were standing there.  As we were coming closer and we were hurrying or in a hurry, they retreated towards, and stopped at a trade garage near the robots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After the group crossed Frikkie Meyer Boulevard on their way back, did you follow the same route when you went there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now whilst you were on that tarred section from the bridge you referred earlier on, towards the main entrance of kwaMadala Hostel, did you see any military vehicles or police vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I didn't see police on that day, I only saw the soldiers vehicles which I've just mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I just want to get clarity, did you see soldiers' vehicles on your way back from the bridge to the main gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When you got back into the hostel, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We went back into the hostel and then we went to the stadium again.  That is where we were told that we should disperse into our houses before the police could come.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We dispersed and I myself, as my house or my room was near the gate, I met Mr Mthembu.  I would say about five minutes after we arrived in the hostel the soldiers' vehicles which we saw at the robots arrived at the place.  If I remember well they did ask Mr Mthembu as to whether all the inmates of the hostel are inside the hostel.  I think Mr Mthembu said: "Yes, they are all in".</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>	They asked that because they said they saw a group of people which crossed the road and they thought maybe they were hiding on the grass behind the hostel.  They said we must be watchful because they will try and search for those people whom they thought hid behind the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>	They said they will get something that will give them enough light to see all the place.  After that I went back to my room and slept.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is this Mthembu you're referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Mr Moses Mthembu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Who said you should disperse before the police have arrived, when you were at the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I think it is Mr Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At that stage, were you working at some firm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I was a worker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you go to your work the next day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I went to work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After the attack, did you see that goods that were taken in Boipatong were burnt inside kwaMadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> All I can say about ...[indistinct] is that as we were coming back to the hostel people were carrying goods like TV's but when those goods were burnt or when the instruction was given that they should be burnt I wasn't present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> We were handed an affidavit this morning, an unsigned document which purports to be an affidavit of Andries Nosenga ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom, just before you get to that affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>	Did anyone tell you that you must now leave Boipatong and return to the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> At the time when the group was busy, the other group which went towards Slovo Park, which I thought it might have reached Slovo Park, we saw it coming towards us and we joined them and went back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This group that had been to Slovo Park, how did you know that they were now leaving Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> When they were turning and coming back they were coming along the same street we were in, so as they were coming up we came and met them and then we agreed that we should go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are we to understand you as saying that you entered Boipatong from the one side and then you went through the houses stoning them, stabbing one man, chasing the others until you reached the other side of the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may return to the affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I just want to return to what happened inside Boipatong.  You said that you stabbed one person, you saw that other people also stabbed this person.  Apart from that incident where there was a specific attack on a person, did you see other attacks on persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, the attack continued.  Even if I wouldn't say I did see people doing anything because others went into the houses.  All that I saw was what was happening outside where we were running, following these other people who were retreating, where we were breaking the windows and there were some sound of rifles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You said there were sounds of rifles, did you hear many shots or just a few?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say rifles or guns were being fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see a person die in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Referring to the one I stabbed, I wouldn't say I saw him dying, I would say that the others stabbed him as I was running after those who were running away, he might have died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But apart from this specific person, did you see any other person who was shot and died or who was stabbed and died in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> One person that I think I've see who was stabbed was the one who was stabbed by Victor Mthembu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know in relation to the township and the streets, where this took place?  If you can't name a street's name, did it happen early on during the attack or later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> When I look back I would say it's about a short period of time, seven to ten minutes after the attack, while we were running after the people that were retreating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Apart from the applicants before this Committee, do you remember the names of any other people in that group that were with you when the attack took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would like to explain.  Even those who are in the hall, the only people I saw are two among them.  That they were present I heard from them.  The persons I saw was Victor Mthembu and also Nanamshlopeki Shabango.  Those who are not present here, there was one known by the name of Gobi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the name of the person that you've just mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I knew him as Gobi.  Another one was Ephraim Makasana, and another one who was know to me by the name of Jumbluti, and the other one was known as Mfana Futi, and another one by the name of Holi, another was Tzwee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would this be the same person who was a member of the Youth Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.  Another one was Mexlendo Damiheza, and another one known as Mxena.  The others I just know them facially but I don't know their names because in kwaMadala people will be flocking the hostel, each and everybody running away from the township.  As a person who was working most of the time I didn't know most of the people in the hostel, I just knew them facially but I didn't know their names.  Those are all  that I can still remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you remember - Chairperson, will this be a convenient stage to take the adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you still going to be long?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well let's finish then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>	At that time, did you know a person by the name of Andries Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't know the Maseka that I know.  I know someone by the name of ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Matanzima, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, Matanzima Masenga.  If you are referring to that one, that is the only one that I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now the person you are referring to now, did you see him on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, I didn't see him, however he is a person I happen to know as Matanzima.  I know him or knew him because when he arrived at the hostel he was someone who was sent to do some reconnaissance as to how bombs could be planted inside the hostel.  I've heard some rumours after he was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was he supposed to plant these bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The ANC people had a problem with entering and attacking kwaMadala Hostel therefore they had to use him as a person who was going infiltrate Inkatha and join as a member while he was to be used to plant the bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Where did you hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I heard it from, we were in a meeting which occurred at kwaMadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> This meeting you're referring to, did it take place before or after the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Even if I don't remember well, it was before the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During that time, did you know a person by the name Victor Kezuas, he's also got a nickname: "Katsisi"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I was ...[indistinct] close to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That night of the attack on Boipatong, was he present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> As a person who was always arrested now and then, I would say he was in jail at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On the night of the attack, did you see any vehicle - if I can rephrase, so-called Hippo vehicle picking up people and taking them into Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That never happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know a person by the name of Themba Mabote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> They night of the attack did you see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did he partake in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know how he got to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> He was in the group, one of the group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did he have a firearm in his possession at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It looks like he had a 9mm gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know a person by the name of Celo Hunter Mzozo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't know whether you are referring to Hunter Celo Ndlovu or was someone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, I said that, maybe not in that sequence but that's the person I'm referring to.  Do you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see him on the night of the 17th of June partaking in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I didn't see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now I want to return to what happened after the attack.  Did you see Mr Themba Xhosa at the hostel after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> He came a few days after the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the question not directed at whether Themba Xhosa was present at the hostel on the night of the attack?  Was that your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson, I made reference to what happened after the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>END OF TAPE - POSSIBLE WORD LOSS</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Even if I won't know the exact reason for visiting the place, what I can remember is that we had a problem because we couldn't, we were not able to go to the shops because the whole kwaMadala Hostel was surrounded by police, therefore life wasn't good in the hostel.  He was the one who could go and talk to the police when we want to talk to them or when they want to talk to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were the police preventing the residents of kwaMadala Hostel from going to the shops?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't understand when you say: "protecting them" or "stopping them from going to the shops"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It means: "preventing them".</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> From Tuesday, Thursday the 18th of June, anyone who was a resident at kwaMadala Hostel wasn't allowed to go out of the hostel until the following Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who was preventing the people from going out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The kids?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, did you say: "the kids"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Will you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] the 18th of June, no residents of kwaMadala Hostel were allowed out of the hostel.  What I want to know is, who was preventing the residents from leaving the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thinking back at this stage, what are your feelings about the attack that took place on the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> All I can say is that the time when there was an attack at Boipatong, I wouldn't say that time I was happy about it because I convinced myself that the time has come for me to pay revenge but after a few days, I would say two days, after hearing that children and women were killed I felt very sorry and disappointed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you still have those feelings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, Mr Strydom, I no longer feel the same.  All I can say is that after the incident I was committed to peace because I would say that there are so many things that I have done from that time up to today which we efforts to reconcile the ANC and the IFP, especially in the hostels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>	I would say I would even have witnesses who are not members of my organisation and who might come direct from the ANC, who can give evidence on these efforts of trying to reconcile people towards a peaceful situation because after coming out from prison I was elected as a leader within the IFP.  I used that position to bring about peace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>	To add, I don't think there is anyone who knew that IFP members who entered the Sebokeng Hostel and that they could enter Kwamasiza Hostel and that people who were resident at Sebokeng can enter kwaMadala Hostel, but because of my commitment together with my brothers working together, that had happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is there anything else you want to add to your application at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would like to ask permission to say this, especially to the relatives, the family victims.  I would say we, the African people, we were unlucky because when we received politics we were taught that anyone who doesn't agree with you is an enemy and must be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>	I would say that I would like to ask for forgiveness for all that I've done.  I didn't do these things intentionally.  I would say what was difficult at the time was that there was lawlessness in the country, the government in charge was not in the position to protect the people of this country and therefore each and every person took the law into his or her own hands. 	I'm saying this because many IFP followers were killed at Vaal during the day, many IFP families were burnt during daylight.  We reported that daily and during the night to the police, however even up to today not even a single person was charged for such crimes.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, that is my evidence in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STRYDOM</p>

<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Berger, have you decided who is going to start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm going to start Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand that Miss Cambanis would want to be excused at 3 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Yes, Chair, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you want to put questions now before you leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> No, thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MS CAMBANIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] before you proceed, so that we can think about this.  A reference was made to the contents of the unsworn statement and to that extent I don't think there will be any problem in cross-examination on the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>	My understanding is that because it has already been referred to, although not directly but indirectly, there would not be any issue as to its being used for the purposes of cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>	Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I won't object if that statement is put to this witness for his comments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, I don't think there's any difficulty in that Mr Chairman.  Insofar as it may form part of an amnesty application.  It's been referred to and that confidentiality can be waived by the Committee in the interests of pursuing the full facts that can be put to the witness, so there is no prejudice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  If I could just place on record that the documents which we received and which we made the Committee - no, no, I just wanted to say this, we don't have the full application for amnesty.  It might well be, and for that we would rely on Mr Prior and his team, it might well be that the unsworn affidavit was annexed, it seems to have been annexed, to an application for amnesty.  The application for amnesty ought to have been sworn to and so then this would have been an annexure to the application for amnesty, if I'm correct.  I don't know, perhaps Mr Prior can just assist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, may I just briefly say, according to Mr van Rensburg in Cape Town who was the analyst preparing this matter, the application as we have it before us is incomplete, although the TRC had the completed version as it.  The affidavit unsigned and unattested was received at some other stage but was not annexed to the initial application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, let's proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>	Mr Khanyile, when did you first decide to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I can't remember the exact time but I think it's a long time ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were convicted in 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the time of your conviction, had you decided to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> After I was convicted or before I was convicted, can you clarify?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the time when you were convicted, and let me be specific, you were sentenced on the 9th of June 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the time when you were sentenced, the 9th of June 1994, had you already decided to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, I hadn't yet decided because I didn't know anything about amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As at the 9th of June 1994, do I understand you correctly, you were not even considering the question of amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did you consider the question of amnesty for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> After we were convicted our lawyers explained to us about the amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say, if my memory serves me well, it was in 1996 or 1995, I don't remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when did you take a decision that you were going to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Even if I don't remember well, but the lawyers did tell us that, specifically on the day we decided to go and apply for amnesty, they informed us that we have to go and apply for amnesty because the closing date is near.  All I know is that it was just before the closing of the amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At that time where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I was at Khayelitsha Hostel, called Ethlatin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Which Province is that in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It's here at Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was that in 1995, 1996 or 1997?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> As I've explained before, between 1995 and 1996, I don't remember exactly what year it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did it take you until the 29th of January 1998 before you signed your amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Firstly, I didn't know much about the amnesty.  After I've agreed with my lawyers that I'm going to ask for amnesty, that's all I could do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, my question is simply this: if you informed your lawyers in 1995 or 1996 that you wish to apply for amnesty, why did it take you until January 1998 before you signed your application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> My answer was Mr Berger, at the time when I agreed with my lawyers that I'm going to apply for amnesty I left it in their hands to do what was supposed to be done because they know the procedure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do I understand you correctly, that you cannot explain the delay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Sir, if there has been a delay I think it is with the lawyers, it is not me, I didn't know anything about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it correct that you were always available from 1995 until 1998 to sign an application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, would please have a look at page 93 of the bundle in front of you?  If you look from page 93 through to 95, that is your application, who filled it out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The questions and the answers in this application, I would say I gave the answers, the signature on the papers is mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So the words used on page 93, 94 and 95 in answer to the various questions, those are your words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> If they're written the way I've stated them, yes, that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well have they been read to you at any time and translated to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the words that are contained in that document are words that you agree with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> If the Interpreter who explained to me that this is what was written on the paper, yes, I agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then page 96 and 97, are those also your words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You're lawyers asked you certain questions, in particular question 9 and question 10 and these are the answers that you gave, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it correct also that the answers from page 100 to page 102 are your answers, those are your words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, as I've already explained to you Sir, that if the Interpreter who was interpreting for me was what is written on the paper, I would say all that is written in this application are my words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now at page 96, in answer to question 9(a)(1) you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a>"The attack on Boipatong on the 17th of June 1992 when 46 people were killed, public violence was committed and at least 17 people were injured"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>... are the acts for which you seek amnesty.  You went on to say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>"For further information, attached hereto is the following"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>The first thing you attached was the charge sheet and the second thing you attached was the Judgment of the Trial Judge on the merits of the criminal case.  You attached two other documents but they are not relevant for present purposes.  Do I understand what you have done correctly, that you have attached the Judgment of the Judge as further information of what you did on that night in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I will try to explain with regard to the criminal case because you've mentioned the Judgment.  What I said in Pretoria was said in the purpose of defending myself to be acquitted, and what I am saying here today is the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I understand from you that you lied in Pretoria, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would I also be correct to say that the evidence which the State led against you in Pretoria, which you denied then but you now admit, as being correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> All I can say is that the evidence I gave in Pretoria, the only thing that is true is that I was involved but any other evidence given by me was false.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, perhaps you've misunderstood me.  In Pretoria - let's take it step by step, in Pretoria you told the court that you were not involved but the State witnesses told the court that you were involved.  You know admit, am I correct, that the State witnesses were correct and you were telling lies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't know whether the Interpreter is giving the right interpretation, but what I'm saying is that whatever was said, any evidence that was given concerning me, the only thing that is true is that I was there when the attack took place.  However, whatever evidence I gave, that I did that and that, was not true.  The truth is what I'm saying today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one second Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>	Mr Khanyile, maybe you're not understanding Mr Berger properly - carry on Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, when you gave evidence in Pretoria you told the Judge that you were not involved in the attack, that was a lie, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The State witnesses in Pretoria told the court that you were involved in the attack, that was the truth, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Am I correct then to assume that you now accept what the State witnesses told the court in Pretoria against you, you now accept that that is the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Mr Berger, I will try to explain in this way.  Many things have been said by the State witnesses against me, some of which was not true.  I'm saying the only thing that I think they were telling the truth about is that I was involved in the attack at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When the State witnesses said that in Pretoria, you said that they were liars, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct, I said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now you say they were telling the truth in that respect but they were not telling the truth in respect of other things which you did during the attack, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What in particular do you dispute?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> They said a lot of things about me.  All that the State witnesses were saying, they were just pointing at anybody whom they knew.  To give an example, Mr Qambelani Buthelezi was sentenced to 18 years but he doesn't even know exactly what was happening at Boipatong.  However, State witnesses said he was involved and he did get himself involved in the attack.  As a person who was staying with me in the same house, and a person whom I left while he was sick in bed, and when I came back from Boipatong I found him in the house sleeping.  I'm trying to say Mr Berger, that the State witnesses said a lot of things which were not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, I didn't ask ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, perhaps to shorten this, would you please indicate to us what it is that the State witnesses said often concerning you and which was not the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>Did you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I have a problem, I think the Interpreter has given me the impression that it was directed to the lawyer, can you please repeat it for me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have told us that, repeatedly I think you have, that the State witnesses lied in certain respects, that is in regard to what you were alleged to have done at Boipatong.  Would you just give us an indication of those respects in which you say the State witnesses lied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes.  Firstly, if I remember well there were about three or four State witnesses and all of them said different things, contradicting evidence about me.  One of them said I was holding a spear, which is true.  The other one said I was holding an AK47, which is not true.  I don't remember, the other one seemed to have said I was holding a gun and of which it was not true.  If I remember well one of the witnesses said I personally, when we met with the police, as he was speaking in Afrikaans I don't remember what he said about talking to the white people or the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see Mr Khanyile, what I don't understand is this, when you answered a question in the form about the things you did in Boipatong, you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>"For further information I annexe a copy of the Judgment"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>Now at page 304 of the second bundle, which is page 3752 of the Judgment, the Judge in dealing with you - you were accused number 58, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The Judge first of all spoke about the evidence of Bojozi who, as you correctly said, first of all said that you were armed with an assegai and a kierrie but then later conceded that he couldn't remember how you were armed.  Then the Judge goes on to deal with the evidence of Mr Moloi who said that you picked up an AK47 in the stadium and the Judge appears to accept that evidence.  What I want to know is why you annexed this as providing further details about y our participation if you don't accept that it's the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Sir, I will say it was by mistake that it was included.  I wasn't aware that that was written, what you are saying was written there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The Judge further went on to recount the evidence of Mr Moloi, again which the Judge apparently accepted.  Mr Moloi said that you came to call people in their rooms, telling them to go to the stadium that night.  You told people to put white lappies around their heads and you handed out the Ntelezi, is that also wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say a lot of those things are not true, I mean evidence that was accepted by the Judge.  As I've already given an example of Mr Buthelezi who was sentenced to 18 years and who was said to be present during the attack, fortunately he wasn't there and I would say the Judge made a lot of mistakes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you call people from their rooms telling them to go to the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't know under what rank or position I had the power to go around and call people ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just hold it.  Mr Interpreter, we can't hear you, maybe you forgot to press the button.    Please just repeat that answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I'm trying to explain to Mr Berger that people won't understand why a person like me should go out and call them to come out because I didn't have any rank or position or mandate to call them out.  All that I know is that at the kwaMadala Hostel we normally called through an announcement on a speaker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] so that we can make</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>...[inaudible] would you please answer yes or no?  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] for you to elaborate, I'm sure that your counsel will take that opportunity in re-examination, to request you to explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you can help this Committee by confining yourself to the answer.  Can we take it that your answer now is that: no, you did not call the people to the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's correct, I didn't call people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who did call people over the loudspeaker to the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I didn't see the person speaking, I just heard the sound.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You didn't recognise the person's voice, you didn't know whose voice it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would like to explain Mr Berger.  This is not a speaker, I would say in Zulu it's a trumpet which you blow and we as inmates at kwaMadala Hostel, when we hear such a trumpet it means that we all should go to the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it also correct that you never told people to tie white lappies around their heads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And is it also correct that you never handed out the Ntelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I never gave the Ntelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And is it also correct that you never gave any specific instructions to Mr Moloi about what should happen if the police should stop you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So therefore there is nothing in the Judgment on the merits which provides further information about what you did in Boipatong on the night of the massacre, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The only help is that I was involved, it says I was involved, I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, what I want to put to you is, and this is in the light of your answer previously that the annexures which are referred to on page 96 ought not to have been referred to, you said it was a mistake.  What I want to put to you is that page 96 and 97 are not your words, that in fact they were composed by someone else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> What appears here is what I told them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And another reason why I want to suggest to you that these are not your words is because these very same words are annexed to each and every application for amnesty, other than Mr Mthembu's, Mr Victor Mthembu's.  Everyone else has got exactly the same words.  Surely you didn't all say exactly the same thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I will see, I don't know what is written in my brother's applications.  It is probable that we would say the same things because when we were doing all this we were together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When was that when you were all together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I'm referring to the incident of the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Sorry, Honourable Chairperson, may I be excused at this time please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Ma'am, thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>MS CAMBANIS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you gave instructions to your lawyers, the answers to the questions for amnesty, were you on your own or were you together with your other co-applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I was with the other applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And where was this done, where you gave your answers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It was at Khayelitsha Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And all the applicants who are presently in jail, they were present with you at Khayelitsha Hostel when you gave these answers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> If I remember well not all of us were there.  I don't know who was there and who was not there exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see Mr Khanyile, I'm going to move off now from this point but what I want to put to you is that each and every application of those who were in jail and of those who are out on bail is identical and what I want to suggest to you is that these are not your words, that they were drafted by someone else.  You can comment if you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That will not be true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The people who you named as being involved in the attack, you named Mr Victor Mthembu, how was he armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> He was armed with a spear.  If I remember well I saw the spear for the first time when he stabbed someone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So the State witness who said that Mr Victor Mthembu was armed with a 9mm pistol would be incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And again that is another mistake by the Judge in his Judgment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see Mr Thomas Lukhozi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I know Thomas Lukhozi, not Thomas Khosi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, Mr Berger said Lukhozi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I think I do have a problem with the Interpreter, sometimes I don't get the full interpretation or I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> With the interpretation would you please let us know because it is very essential that the questions are accurately conveyed to you, and what is conveyed from you to us is a reflection of what you've said.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I understand you.  I can say that sometimes as I speak I'm speaking the true Zulu, I don't know exactly the kind of Zulu that she is using, it's a Zulu that is used commonly within this area.  I am used to the KwaZulu Natal Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We do understand that there may well be those differences but we want to emphasise is that if you don't understand what the interpreter is saying please let us know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I understand.  What the problem is, is when the answer is given to you I wouldn't be able to know whether that is a true reflection of what I've said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can rest assured that we do understand what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, did you see Mr Thomas Lukhozi on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I didn't see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it so that Mr Lukhozi was one of the leaders of the attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> My personal knowledge is that there were two leaders.  Sorry I couldn't get the names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who were the two leaders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It was Bhekinkosi Mkhize and Busiso Damarra Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know that Mr Bojozi and Mr Lukhozi were good friends?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When was the first time that you saw Mr Victor Mthembu that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I saw Victor Mthembu when we were right inside Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you in a group with Mr Victor Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And who else was in this group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Those whom I can remember is Mr Mthembu, Mr Shabango, Ghobi, Holi, Tzwee and Mfana Futi, Mehlondo Damiheza, Ephraim Makasana and another one known by the name of Gina and Themba Mabote and Damarra Chonco.  Those are the only people I can still remember.  They were people who were with me at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were these individuals that you've just mentioned in the same group in which you and Mr Mthembu were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And as I understand your evidence Mr Khanyile, it was quite a large group that you and Mr Mthembu were in, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Can you tell the Committee where Gobi is today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I now have a problem with the interpretation.  You are saying Gobi and I said Ghobi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, I'll ask you again then, do you know where Ghobi is today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say I normally meet him in town but I don't know exactly where he stays.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How was he armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't remember.  It looked like he was holding a knopkierrie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see him attacking anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I remember regrading the person who was stabbed by Victor Mthembu, he was part of the group which was hitting and stabbing at that man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Besides that, did you see him attacking anyone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me try and short-circuit this.  Of all the other people who you named, Makasana, Jambluti, Mfana Futi, Holi or Gholi, Tzwee, Miheza, Gina, Mabote and Damarra Chonco, are any of them still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say personally only two of them passed away, it's Chonco and Themba Mabote.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Of all the others, do you know where they are presently?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would like to explain a bit.  At the time I was arrested after the attack, I stayed about six months in prison without bail.  I got bail during December and when I came back I found that kwaMadala Hostel had been pulled down or demolished, most of the people were no longer staying there.  Only the people who were working at the ISCOR firm were around.  Unfortunately some of them I last saw before I got arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>	It just happened that I do meet them sometimes, for example I mentioned that I met Ghobi and another one whom I've mentioned before Jambluti.  Those are the only people that I met.  Others since they were not working, I think they might have gone back to their homes in KwaZulu Natal.  Those who were staying in the township might have gone back to their respective homes in the townships.  I don't know exactly where they are staying in the townships.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, the short answer to my question is you don't know where any of those people are today, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And a short answer please, were any of them accused with you in the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The person that I still remember is Jambluti.  I heard he is staying at Zone 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, my question to you was, were any of them co-accused with you in the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It looks like I didn't understand.  I would say that when we were arrested we were 64 and some were taken out and this Jambluti I'm talking about is one of the persons who was released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well apart from Jambluti, were there any of the individuals who were in your group who were co-accused with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't really understand, do you mean those who were released or those who were convicted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tell us about the people who were convicted with you and the lawyer will continue to find out exactly what happened to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Those whom I can still remember are the people who are here.  One person with whom we were convicted, it was Matanda Mgubane, Swelimuti Msane and one known as Mskubu, another one known as Matlauvo, Hunter Celo Ndlovu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, what you wanted to find out was, of the people in the group that he mentioned, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The person I wanted to find out, in the group that he mentioned, correct, were any of them co-accused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Khanyile, listen to the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Will you please repeat the question, I don't understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You told us that you were in a particular group which consisted, amongst others, Tshabangu, Ghobi, Tzwee, Vanana Futi, Mhlendota Miheza, Jambluti and others, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr Berger wants to find out is whether of these individuals who were in your group, were any of them arrested together with you or were any of them your co-accused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I understand.  The only person whom I could say was present ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We know about Jambluti, right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Themba Mabote was one of them, he passed away.  He is the only person whom I can remember, without mentioning the two who are right in front of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mfana Futi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Mfana Futi was never arrested together with the others.  All the others were not arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Ephraim Makasani was arrested.  I just forget he was one of the persons who were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tshabangu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, he's present here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ghobi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Ghobi was never arrested, he was a State witness.  I would say they were arrested but they were released as State witnesses, Ghobi and Holi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And Tzwee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Tzwee was never arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Damarra Chonco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Wasn't arrested, Damarra was not arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, the people whom you mentioned who were convicted, I put it to you were not convicted.  The only people who were convicted are the applicants presently before the Committee ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But Mr Berger, I didn't understand Mr Khanyile to say they were convicted.  I think he indicated that persons like Ghobi and Holi for example were arrested and then they turned State witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm not referring to those people Chairperson.  There was a whole group of people before that whom the witness said had been convicted but I can move on, it's not essential.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But which group are you referring to, are you not referring to this group that he has just mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, not that group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a>	Mr Khanyile, there was a group of people whose names you mentioned, not the group that we've been dealing with, not the applicants but another group of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please give us the names of the people in that group that you say he mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, the witness went too fast for me, I never got the names down so I can't assist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I can assist with the reference to the names that were mentioned.  The are written here.  The name Skubi, Masani, Matasani and Hunter Celo Ndlovu.  I don't know if that's the group Mr Berger is referring to.  I'm not sure if I got all the names but those I've written down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Yes, and the other one was Matanda Mgubani.  That was one name also mentioned of that group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>	And the point I was making Mr Khanyile is those people were not convicted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Mr Berger, when I gave you these names I was answering your question where you asked me how many people were arrested with me.  I even asked for clarification as to whether you're referring to people who were convicted or people who were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me leave that group.  The group of people that you say were part of your group, I'm now talking about Tshabangu, Ephraim Makasana and the others, did any of them have a gun which you saw then firing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> People whom I saw holding the guns or rifles were two, it was Damarra and Themba Mabote.  Even if there were people who were also armed with guns or arms ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> There is no translation in English of any of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> There might be a technical problem, you were on air.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Please repeat the answer Mr Interpreter, we can't hear a word.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> People whom I saw right in Boipatong who were armed with guns or firearms were two people, Mr Damarra Chonco and Themba Mabote.  There might be others who were armed with guns or rifles but I didn't see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were asked about Mr Andries Nosenga and you said you know a Mr Matanzima Nosenga, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I said if it is someone who is called by the name of Matanzima, it's true I know him, it's just the surname that I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did you first meet him at kwaMadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Even if I don't remember the exact time, what I can remember is we were called to the stadium and we're to be told about him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It was before the attack.  Excuse me I want to rectify there.  It was before the attack at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who addressed you at the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Even if I'm not very sure in what I'm going to say, I would say Prince Vanana Zulu who was present on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was this a meeting of all the residents in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So if I understand you correctly, at some stage before the attack all the residents of the hostel were called together in the stadium, addressed by Vanana Zulu who said that this man Matanzima is a spy for the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I've clearly explained that it was Mr Zulu who was conducting the meeting.  He is the person who told us or explained to us about Mr Matanzima.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were you told about Matanzima?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We were told that it has been established that since Matanzima is inside the hostel, he has been sent to do a reconnaissance as to how bombs could be planted in the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How long before the attack was this, a month, two months, a year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say approximately two months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what happened to Matanzima after this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Matanzima was taken.  The decision was taken that he should be taken to a conference of the IFP to explain his involvement in the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And was there such a conference of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Which conference are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well you've just told us that it was decided that Matanzima should be taken before the conference of the ANC to explain about his activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Just for the record Chairperson, you said ANC and I believe the witness said IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you present when Mr Matanzima was called before the IFP to explain his actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I last heard about it when they were talking about him at the stadium, whether he was taken to Ulundi or not I don't know, I didn't go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you ever given a briefing or did anyone ever report back to you on the actions that had been taken by the IFP against Matanzima?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say since Matanzima came back and said he had fully joined the IFP as a real member, it looked like they sat down with him and talked with him.  I don't know what happened, I thought they brought him back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you referring to the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> As I've explained before, the decision was taken by Matanzima himself when it was decided they would take him to the conference.  I don't know but I've seen is that those people who went for the conference, they came back with him, so we were not called, briefed as to what was said about him or what happened to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought you mentioned that he had joined the organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I heard, it was rumoured around that he has officially joined the IFP but that was not explained in a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were told or you overheard that he had now joined the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, if I understand you correctly, after he was spoken to, or this is your understanding, after Matanzima was spoken to by the leadership of the IFP he was then accepted into the IFP as a full member, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> What I don't know is whether he was accepted at the conference or at kwaMadala Hostel, can you clarify for me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well after he had gone to explain his apparent actions or his alleged actions about spying or carrying out secret activities for the ANC, he explained that, as far as you understood to the IFP leadership and then he returned to kwaMadala and the talk amongst people at kwaMadala was that Matanzima is now in the IFP as a full member of the IFP, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I can say that what was said at the conference, whether he was called to explain something or he explained something, I don't know.  All that I heard is that they are going with him to the conference and thereafter, later I was told that he has officially become a member of the IFP, that's all I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And after he had officially become a member of the IFP, Matanzima then returned to kwaMadala Hostel, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So then at the time of the attack, I would be correct to say that Matanzima was an IFP member living in kwaMadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Even if I can't confirm that to be the truth, I think it was like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, because we intend sitting until late, we intend taking a 15 minute break, so at an appropriate time would you indicate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, could I just get an indication of how long after the tea break we're going to be sitting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 5 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, perhaps this would then be the appropriate point to take the adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will take a 15 minutes bread and we will come back at 4 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">VINCENT KUSAHUSA KHANYILE:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> (cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>	Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a>	Mr Khanyile, if we are talking about the same person, Mr Matanzima and Mr Nosenga, I want to tell you what in general terms he says in this document.  He says that the police were involved to the extent he says, that police Casspirs or he says a police Casspir was used to transport some of the attackers, including himself into Boipatong.  Now do you say that that is a lie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Sir, I would say even God knows police were not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's not only Mr Nosenga who says this but members of the community who were in Boipatong the night of the attack saw police Casspirs or armed vehicles in Boipatong at the time of the attack, is that also not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would try to explain in this way.  During the hearing of our case, our criminal case, we were also going to rely on the fact that we had police, however the disappointment was that 80% of the people from Boipatong denied that they did see police taking part in the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a>	All I can say is that at the time when all the statement or issues were discussed, it was just a political game.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what is the answer to the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The answer Mr Berger is what Matanzima said is lies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr Berger put to you was that Mr Matanzima is not the only person who is making the allegation that the police were involved, even the members of the community say that they saw police in Boipatong at the time of the attack, police vehicles inside Boipatong at the time of the attack, what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> My answer to that is that that is not true because I explained even before the Judge, residents of Boipatong denied that police were involved.  Even the time when we got convicted it was denied that, it was not established that police were present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did I understand you correctly Mr Khanyile, to say that during the criminal trial you were alleging, you meaning you and the accused, were alleging that there were police in Boipatong but the residents were saying that there were not, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> May you please repeat your question, I didn't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did I misunderstand you or am I correct, that you said that at the time of the criminal trial you were claiming that there were police in Boipatong but the residents were saying that there were not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Let me try to explain, to clarify my answer.  I said, during the trial even us were relying on that rumours that police were involved, however what surprised us is that during the time of evidence, when they were giving evidence and when people were asked whether they did see the police, it was discovered that they didn't see the police.  Most people or witnesses said they saw the police after the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did anyone of the person who were accused ...[no English translation] tell the court that when they went into Boipatong the police were also present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Khanyile, was it maybe part of your instructions to your lawyers to put it to the court that it was the police that attacked at Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It looks like it's not clear.  I never said police attacked the people at Boipatong, what I was trying to explain is that in answering Mr Berger's question when he said the community of Boipatong said that they saw police in Casspirs, when answering his question I said we as the accused at that time, we thought maybe that evidence might free us from the case because we were not supposed to be convicted if police were involved, not that I was saying we personally saw the police or that the police were there.  I'm trying to say that the community said there were police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Not only do the community or certain people in the community say that there were police vehicles in Boipatong at the time of the attack, they go further to say that there were white men involved in the killing, involved in the attack, what do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That never happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Mr Khanyile, can you really vouch for that or can you say you never saw it happen, you personally never saw it happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I'm trying to explain that when we left kwaMadala Hostel we went into the Boipatong area and we got out of Boipatong, I never saw a white person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Yes, the point I'm trying to get across to you is that there is a difference when you say something never happened or when you say: "I never saw it happen".</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say I myself personally, I didn't see a white person on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it your evidence that all the attackers were people who had just before the attack gathered in the stadium of kwaMadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when you were in the stadium, I take it you never saw any white men?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> According to ISCOR, there were approximately 430, if my figures are correct, residents in kwaMadala Hostel at the time of the attack, would that be right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> My perception is that it's about 900 to 1000 residents or was.  If you are referring specifically to workers who work at ISCOR, it might be true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Certain people who gave statements on behalf of the Defence Force said that at one stage they saw a crowd which they estimated at totalling approximately 500 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That is their estimation.  I said there were about 350 to 400.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> According to ISCOR, some of their employees saw a crowd which they estimated to be in the number of about 800 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So my question to you really is this, are you being honest when you say that all the people who formed part of the attackers came from kwaMadala or is it not the position that the attackers from kwaMadala were supplemented by others, in particular members of the police and in particular white men?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> As I've already explained Mr Berger, what you are saying is not true, even the almighty himself knows that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it correct Mr Khanyile, that Mr Vanana Zulu is also known and was also known at the time as Ntwana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And is it correct that he was the only person known as Ntwana in kwaMadala Hostel at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Even he's not, the only one referred to as Ntwana according to the King's tradition, when you're referring to Ntwana in the hostel probably you were referring to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who was Gateni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't know Gateni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know anyone by the name of Gatcheni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, one person whom I knew is called Gatcheni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And who was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I only knew him as Gatcheni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well could you tell the Committee what position Gatcheni held in kwaMadala at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> He didn't hold any position.  I think I've already mentioned those who held positions in that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> According to you Gatcheni was just another resident of kwaMadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga says that the people - this in paragraph 6, the people who were in charge of the attack were Ntwana and he says here, Gateni but let's take it as Gatcheni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> During the time of the attack, Ntwana was at home for two or one week.  I don't know the whereabouts of Gatcheni at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see Mr Khanyile, the difficulty I have with that answer is that Mr Victor Mthembu told the Committee the last time when he gave evidence, that he saw Mr Vanana Zulu Ntwana at the hostel on the 17th of June 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I wouldn't dwell much on Mr Mthembu's answers to the Committee, all that I know is what I'm saying can be confirmed by Mtwana himself and other residents of kwaMadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you see you told the Committee now that Mr Zulu had been away from the hostel for a week before the attack, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I said it's about a week or two weeks, I'm not exactly sure as to whether it was a week or two weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Zulu told the court when he gave evidence, that he was away from the hostel from the 5th of June until the 22nd of June.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That might be the truth but I'm confirming what I'm saying, that he was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So are you then saying that Mr Victor Mthembu is not telling the truth when he said that he saw Mr Vanana Zulu catching a taxi away from the hostel on the, I think he said in the afternoon of the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say it's not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it that both of you are incorrect?  That in fact, well to one extent Mr Mthembu is correct that Mr Zulu was at the hostel on the 17th of June, he never went away and he was part of the attackers in Boipatong that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> What I'm saying is the truth that cannot be denied or contradicted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You told the Committee this morning, and I will quote you your words: that nothing happens or happened in kwaMadala Hostel without the knowledge of Mr Vanana Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well when then was Mr Vanana Zulu informed that there was going to be an attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I didn't say that even if he's away in KwaZulu Natal he has to be informed, I was referring to incidents when he's inside kwaMadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You said: "There was nothing that would take place without consulting Mr Vanana Zulu, nothing", now I put it to you that it could not have happened that such an important decision as the decision to attack Boipatong could have taken without consulting Mr Vanana Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That might be what you are thinking because what I said is when he is present all the reports are sent to him, I never explained that when he is not present he's normally given the message or consulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You told the Committee about a meeting which was held three weeks before the attack on Boipatong, we're talking now about a meeting towards the end of May 1992, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> You mean the first meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Even if I don't remember that it was on the exact date that you are mentioning, I would say that it was about three weeks before the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In other words it was at a time when, even on his own evidence, Vanana Zulu was in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't understand as to whom you are referring, the person who was giving evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let's just go to the meeting which was held three weeks before the attack, Vanana Zulu was at that meeting, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> ...[indistinct] was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And at that meeting residents of kwaMadala complained to the leadership that they wanted to take action against the residents of Boipatong and the leadership said: "Leave it to us, we need to think about this"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> What I can remember is, when the residents gave those complaints or raised the complaint to the leaders it was Mkhize who said: "You must leave it to the leaders since they've heard the issues".  I'm not sure whether it was Damarra Mkhize but I should think it's Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Victor Mthembu says that Mr Vanana Zulu and Mr Mkhize took a decision to attack the Vaal community, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It might be possible that I was not in that meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Victor Mthembu goes further, he says: "The attack of the 17th of June in Boipatong was not approved by the IFP leadership",</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That will mean, or I would say that is from Mr Mthembu.  To my knowledge it is that it was something that's been taken within or inside.  I don't know whether the senior members of the organisation were involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you agree or do you disagree with the statement by Victor Mthembu that the attack on the 17th of June was not approved by the IFP leadership?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't understand when you say it was not approved by the IFP leaders.  You are presenting the facts as if it was something where the leaders were sitting down and discussing and they're refusing to approve the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is being said that the attack was not approved by the IFP as an organisation, do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I understand but I don't understand when you say it wasn't approved because it looks like it was something that was discussed and someone denied or didn't approve of what was being discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is said that Mr Mthembu said before the Committee that the attack at Boipatong was not approved by the IFP as an organisation, what do you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I would say it's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu goes further and he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>"All the residents of the kwaMadala Hostel were afraid of Chonco and they were forced to attend the meeting", do you agree with that?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> There somewhere I don't understand, you said they were forced to attend the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, that's what I've read to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought you said they were forced to go to the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, that's what I just read and I'm asking the witness if he agrees with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The Interpreter is talking about something totally, he's talking about the organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a>	It is said that people were forced to attend at meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Which meeting, do you mean the meeting to attack or any other meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let's start with the meeting on the 17th of June, the meeting in the stadium.  Were residents forced to attend that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> My perception of the situation at the time was that all the people who were at the stadium were there of their own free will.  I was also one of them who was freely and voluntarily at the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was there any meeting of the residents of kwaMadala at which residents were forced to attend because they were afraid of Chonco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And finally, in this paragraph that I'm reading from, Mr Thembu said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>"Vanana Zulu knew about it but he went to his family.  Either he knew that residents were forced to attend a meeting or he knew that the attack did not have the approval of the IFP leadership"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I will not deny that.  I don't know when Vanana Zulu and Mthembu discussed this, I personally don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see my difficulty is this, on your own evidence Vanana Zulu was aware of the problems of the kwaMadala residents, I'm referring to the meeting of three weeks before the attack, he knew that the residents wanted action, he knew that the leadership had told the residents: "Leave it to us, we will think about this", and he either knew that people were being forced to attend a meeting on the 17th or he knew that the attack did not have the sanction of the IFP leadership, and you are saying that at that critical time Mr Vanana Zulu just left the hostel to go and stay with his family,  can that possibly be right Mr Khanyile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would like to explain to Mr Berger that it didn't mean if Vanana Zulu was not at kwaMadala Hostel nothing could happen, there were other leaders who would act in his position.  That he left for his home knowing that there will be an attack, whether he didn't know, it's something that I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you see it goes further than that because Mr Vanana Zulu had a personal interest in at least one house in Boipatong and that was the house where his parents-in-law lived.  At the time of attack Mr Zulu's parents-in-law were living in Boipatong.  Are you saying that with knowledge of a possibility of an attack on Boipatong, Mr Vanana Zulu would have left whilst his family was in the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the question you are putting to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The question I'm putting to this witness is that there were a number of reasons, not least of them personal, why Mr Vanana Zulu would not have left the hostel at that critical time, and I'm putting to him that he is therefore protecting Mr Zulu when he says that Mr Zulu was not in charge of the attack and not present during the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you understand that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] why he had to be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> What I'm trying to explain Mr Berger, is one thing and that is that during the attack at Boipatong, Mr Zulu was not present.  As I said he was away for a week or about three weeks.  The question of whether he knew or didn't know is something that I don't know, all that I know is that he was not present during the attack at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The meeting three weeks before the attack, you say the leaders said: "Let us think about it".  Then there was a meeting a week before the attack you say, that would have been on the 10th of June, at that meeting was there an instruction given that Boipatong had to be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, it wasn't given.  What we were told is that we should be vigilant, that so and so should be attacked we were not told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me refer you to page 95, paragraph 11(b), now you've told the Committee that these are your words.  You were asked to give particulars of the, relating to the orders or approval which you received in relation to the acts which you committed and this is what you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a>"An order was given by leaders of the IFP living in the kwaMadala Hostel, that Boipatong must be attacked.  The orders were given on the 10th and the 17th of June 1992.  The leaders were Mkhize and Chonco.  Mkhize lives in the Khayelitsha Hostel"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>Is that answer not correct Mr Khanyile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> What is written there I can't confirm.  That Mkhize is staying in Khayelitsha is not true, he was staying at kwaMadala Hostel.  Also that we were told before the 17th that Boipatong should be attacked, that is not true, we were told on the 17th, on the day of the attack, that: "Today you are supposed to go and attack Boipatong".</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did you say that an instruction was given on the 10th of June 1992, if no such instruction was given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The instruction I'm referring to is that we were told that there will be an attack but Boipatong was not mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was that?  Was that the second meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, the second meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, I asked you whether these were your words, you say that they were read back to you and that they were correct.  My question to you is, why did you say that instructions were given both on the 10th of June and on the 17th of June, that Boipatong must be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I object to that question, that is not what is stated here.  What is stated here is that, and I'm going to read it in Afrikaans</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>'n Bevel deur leiers van die IFP, woonagtig in die kwaMadala Hostel, dat Boipatong aangeval moet word.  Bevele is gegee op die 10de en 17de Junie"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>It does not state that the order to attack Boipatong was given on the 10th and on the 17th of June.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just come again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It's not stated here that the order to attack Boipatong was given on the 10th and the 17th of June.  Orders were given on the 10th and 17th of June, that is what is stated here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, I'll ask you the question again, why did you state here in 11(b), that orders were given on the 10th and 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> What I'm trying to explain is that I said we were informed that there was a possibility of an attack on that day, I don't deny that.  What I deny is that we were told that we were going to attack a specific place at a particular time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me ask you this, what instruction were you given on the 10th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The instruction was that we should stay vigilant and be prepared and ready, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Be prepared and ready for what Mr Khanyile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Mr Berger, when they say: "Get ready", meaning that your arms or weapons should be next to you, even a young child will understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It means: get ready for an attack does it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's what I understood it to mean.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what did you understand or who did you understand was going to be the target of that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I didn't know exactly as to the particular which we were to attack because the whole Vaal was an enemy to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you were given these instructions during the second meeting, namely that: "be prepared for the attack", did you think who was going to be the target of the pending attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I would say even if I wasn't sure I thought Boipatong is one of the possible targets because that is one of the places where they were killing us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But it might not have been Boipatong, is that what you're saying, it could have been anywhere else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where else could there have been an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> As I've explained, the whole Vaal wasn't treating us well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So as far as you were concerned you could quite equally have attacked Bophelong, Sharpeville, Sebokeng, any of those townships you could have attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That is also possible but I have already clarified that on those days or during those times, the people who were burning us with tyres were people from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No the other townships, just Boipatong, is that what you're saying now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I said the whole Vaal was killing us, but on those days the people who were really busy killing us were people from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Which day or days are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I'm referring to the days towards the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you not forgetting another meeting Mr Khanyile, a meeting which was held on Sunday the 14th of June 1992 at kwaMadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> If Mr Berger can remind me what was said in the meeting I might remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you've remember a meeting three weeks before the attack, you've remembered a meeting one week before the attack, do you know remember a meeting three or four days before the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't remember the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me refresh your memory, it was a meeting addressed by Mr Themba Xhosa, do you remember it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I still don't remember such a meeting.  To explain Mr Berger, I wasn't going to be able to remember all the meetings because some meetings happened while I was present, some while I was away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Khanyile, please speak up because I can't hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I was trying to explain to Mr Berger that some meetings occurred in my absence while some meetings occurred while I was present but I did attend all the meetings that were held at kwaMadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At some stage in your evidence you said that you never left kwaMadala Hostel, you never went into Boipatong, you stayed in kwaMadala Hostel, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now on the Sunday before the attack, that's the 14th of June, Themba Xhosa and a Mr Dlamini came to kwaMadala and addressed the people in the stadium and it was a meeting where only the men were present.  Dlamini apparently opened the meeting and he said: "The meeting had been called because our people are dying".  He said that this problem had been reported to Mangasutu Buthelezi.  Themba Xhosa also addressed the meeting.  I'm reading from an affidavit from Mr Victor Mthembu and this is what he says Themba Xhosa said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a>"He was also angry at the killing of his people and he said: "if the people come and attack you, you are supposed to fight back and kill them'"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a>Surely Mr Khanyile, you remember this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> As I have already stated, I don't remember this particular meeting and it is clear that I wasn't present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How could you not have been present?  Let's look at the context: you and the other men have been instructed to be on the alert for an attack, you understood that to mean an attack on the residents of Boipatong, you never went out of the hostel, you remained in the hostel, three days before the attack there is this meeting where important issues are being discussed, where were you on that Sunday preceding the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Mr Berger, even if I can't remember exactly where I was on that particular day, I would like to explain that.  The fact that I was staying at kwaMadala doesn't mean that I wasn't invited to visit other people or that I didn't have a girlfriend whom I could visit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What we know Mr Khanyile ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, it's about 5 o'clock, will you please wrap it up now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'll wrap it up now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What we know Mr Khanyile, is that on your own evidence you were in the hostel on that Sunday, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I never said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you said you never left the hostel, therefore you must have been there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Sir, I thought you said since I was staying at kwaMadala, I never went to Boipatong or other places.  I was referring like, that you mean that I never went out of kwaMadala to go wherever I wished to go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile, I'll wrap it up now, you cannot tell the Committee where you were on Sunday the 14th of June, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I believe Mr Berger, you yourself personally, if I were to ask you where were you on the 14th of June, you won't be able to answer that question because I think you only remember a day if there was a particular incident that's so ...[indistinct] to make you remember it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I take it Mr Khanyile, that the answer to my question is: yes, you cannot say where you were on Sunday the 14th of June 1992, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> If I knew Mr Berger, I would have told you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I take that as a: "yes", and I put it to you that the reason that you do not want to admit that you were in this meeting of the 14th of June 1992 is because you know very well that the attack was discussed at that meeting and you want to protect Mr Themba Xhosa, isn't that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Mr Berger, we were told that we are here to speak the truth but I can see that you are pulling me to a side where I have to lie and this is something that I'm not going to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, perhaps this would be an appropriate time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will adjourn now for the day.  We will resume tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.</p>
