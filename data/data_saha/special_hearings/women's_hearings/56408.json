            "I will do two poems.  A poem that comes from a time when I was in struggling to make sense of what was happening around me and also to try understand where my mother was coming from.\n So I'll do that one and also I'll do a poem that is more recent;  that is looking at situations that we are experiencing now also.\n\"Where do they come from, Tell me, tell me, where do they come from.  Tales so brave, tales so strong, Tell me, where do they come from, Tales so brave, tales so strong. Some are so funny, so crazy, unbelievable,  some are so funny, so crazy, unbelievable. They come from the bones of memory.  Watch my eyes, hear my voice, I tell you true.  These tales are from the bones of memory. These tales yare from the bones of memory, of memory, of memory, of memory, from the bones of memory, from the bones of memory, from the bones of memory, from the bones of memory.\nThis is the wedding dancer;  and my mother did not like the fact that I ended up in show business.  And she was very well known when she grew up in a place called Mount Frere, Umchazie and she used to dance in weddings.\n And many people think there's a lot of my mother in me and the more I think about it, the more I realise indeed there's a lot of my mother in me. But when I was writing this poem, there were not a lot of situations to look at that reminded you of the times that my mother was happy and dancing and well-known and doing what she was really good at and loving.\n So, this is the Wedding Dancer.\nMS MHLOPE SINGS POEM\n\"Mama, they tell me you were a dancer They tell me you had long, beautiful legs to carry your graceful body. They tell me you were a dancer.\"\nMS MHLOPE SINGS POEM\nMama, they tell me you sang beautiful solos.  They tell me you smiled and closed your eyes.  Always when the feeling of the song was right, they tell me you smiled and lifted your face up to the sky.\"\nMS MHLOPE SINGS POEM\n\"Mama, they tell me you were always so gentle. They talk of a willow tree, swaying lovingly over clear, running water in early spring.  When they talk of you they tell my you were a slow dancer.\"\nMRS MHLOPE SINGS POEM\n\"Mama, they tell me you were a wedding dancer.  They tell me you smiled, lifted your face up to the sky with your arms curving outward just a little, and your smile, your feet shuffling in the sand -tche tche tche tche tche.\"\nMS MHLOPE SINGS POEM\n\"Mama, how I wish I was there to see you.  They tell me you were a pleasure to watch. Mama, they tell me I'm a dancer too, but I don't know - I don't know for sure what a wedding dancer is. There are no more weddings, but many, many funerals, where we sing and dance, running fast with the coffin of a would-be-bride or a would-be-groom.\n Strange smiles have replaced our tears. Our eyes are full of vengeance, \n Mama, dear, dear Mama, they tell me I am a funeral dancer.\n This poem is called a Leader Remember.  I talk about the bones of memory, because this is the era of the story- teller.  Lovely stories, painful stories, there are funny stories, all kinds of stories.  \n This is the time of the story-teller and every single person in this room has got a story to tell and more must be told.\n This says Leader Remember.\n\"Leader Remember the time you spent fighting for your freedom and that of your people.  The time you played hide and go seek with you oppressor men\n Till they caught you at last\n Put you in chains and lead irons\n Threw you in jail\n Believing in his heart, that you'll never again see the light of day\n Leader Remember how strongly you fought your freedom-loving spirit kicking hard and refusing to die.  Your vision for a better day, giving you power and endurance immeasurable.\n In that cruel torture chamber, while your body lay on the cold cement floor your spirit escaped through the window, and went to mingle with other spirits of countless freedom fighters deep in Africa's Rain Forests.  Where the equatorial moisture whispered that timeless message.  All freedom fighters know.  Don't give up, don't give up.\n Here, take with you love, self-respect, selflessness.  Fight for your people\n Leader Remember the day you walked out. The very minute, the very second as your right foot stepped outside outside the gates of that jail, feasting the air, sun in your face. The joy that washed over you like bucketfuls of honey. The pain that touched your soul like a poisoned arrow of wasted years and potential. At the same time, you eagerly greeted the mammoth task that lay ahead. You vowed and promised to do all in your power to build a better future for you and your people.\n Leader Remember the long suffering women and men, the dignity they lost;  think of the very young and the very old; the hunger they learned to live with in the land of plenty.\n Leader Remember, the promises you made. The hope you represent, Leader remember. You now stand at history's cross roads, compass in hand, the walking stick of your people's experiences, helping you feel for the potholes as you lead the way, Leader Remember.  Corruption and lies will no doubt double the pain they once knew, Leader Remember. Betrayal hurts much more than the sting of a million scorpions. Leader Remember\n We wish you peace in your heart.\n We wish the eagle's sharp vision.  We wish you the ancient African tortoises's wisdom. We wish you the mighty elephant's memory\n So Leader Remember. The mystic equatorial moisture whispering that timeless message all freedom fighters know. Don't give up, don't give up. Here, take with you love, self-respect, selflessness.  Fight for your people.  The fight is never over, Leader Remember.\"\n(Applause).",

            "Thank you Gcina.\n I think that poems that you've given us today, certainly touch on the very many sensitive subjects.  You talk about our relationships with our mother and we're really very grateful to have had you here today.\n We are grateful for whatever it is in our culture that has produced someone like you so that we can talk about our pain, share our laughter and our sadness as well.  I thank you very, very much for sharing this morning with us.  Thank you.\n(Applause).\n I would now like to call Thandi Shezi to the witness stand please.  I would ask people in the audience who have cell phones to please keep them switched off.  It's not very comfortable for the witnesses, in fact, to have the ringing of the cell-phone in the background.  This is a moment for the witness to tell their story, and we'd ask you to respect that as well.\n Thank you Gcina for being with us.\n Mama, thank you for coming today.  We know that it takes incredible courage to come and speak and tell us your story in front of all these people.  But it's important for other people to hear of your suffering.\n I have asked Joyce Seroke to assist you with the telling of your story.  Joyce.",

            "I was participating in the struggle.  I was in the ANC Youth League and I was also involved in WETRO, which was the Women's League.\n In September the police arrived at about one am, but before they arrived I told my mother that I think, I've got a feeling that today something is going to happen, I think police are coming to arrest me, because other comrades had informed me that your name was on the list of the special branch.\n My mother said you must run away.  I said, no, if I run away, they're going to beat all of you here in the house and even the children.  I don't want you to get hurt.  And they came and arrived at me.  There were lots of cars.  It was as if they're coming to fetch the president.  They kicked the doors and they beat up everybody in the house and they said, where are the guns, because I'm always with terrorists I'm also a traitoress and they also want guns.\n They didn't get any guns.  They beat me up until my mother pleaded with them that please, if you want to kill her, take her away from here and kill her away from me.  Just come and show me her corpse.\n So they took me away.  We drove all around Soweto whilst they were picking up other people.  When we arrived at this police station, I can't even remember whether it was John Vorster or Alexandra. When we arrived there I had already been heavily beaten.  I'd been assaulted and even the clothes that I was wearing, they were torn. I was almost naked at that stage.\n They sat me down and they phoned others. They said, today we found the terrorist.  There was also a person who was there by the name of Sam. They said he's and Askari and Sam said it is better to - you must - you had better tell them where are the guns, or else you won't live long. I said to them, I'm not in a position to tell them, because I don't know anything about guns, and then they arrested me.  They handcuffed me behind my back and they also chained my feet and they beat me up for about 20 or 30 minutes.\n They realised that I wasn't talking.  Then they unchained me, they unchained my legs and Sam took the white sack and put it on my head and then he tied it at the back.",

When they arrived there, there were two policemen there.  The one was Van Heerden, but I can't remember the other one.  They said do I know Silver and I said, no, I don't.\n They asked me where did I train, I said, no, I'm not trained.  And they poured cold water on me, they poured acid on this water that they were pouring on me and that acid got into my eye and today I can't see properly in the other eye.\n After that, they took some things like Maglite(?) and they put this on my body and they used this electrodes to choke me and today I still have scars.\n They  choked me until I bit my tongue, because I was trying to breathe with my mouth, because my nostrils weres closed by the sack.  They choked me until I bit my tongue and my tongue got torn.\n They left me at the stage when I told them that I'm a member of IFP, I don't know anything about ANC. They spoke among themselves for a while. After that, they took me to another room. In that room they just shoved me inside the floor of that room and then they were discussing what they're going to do with me.\n And one of them, one of them said, we must just humiliate her and show her that this ANC can't do anything for her; if we do this humiliation act on her, she will speak the truth.\n Then the four of them started raping me, the four of them. The whole four of them started raping me whilst they were insulting me and using vulgar words and said I must tell them the truth. They said if I don't tell them the truth about where the guns are and where is this other person they're looking for, they will do their utmost worst.\n But after they finished raping me, they took me to Sunset Prison, Diepkloof Prison.  At Sunset prison they refused to accept me, because I'd been very much assaulted and injured.  So they took me to the doctor.\n The way I had been assaulted and had been injured, I couldn't speak for myself, I couldn't talk.  When the doctor asked me what had happened, I couldn't even explain to the doctor what has happened to me, because my tongue was swollen in my mouth.  I couldn't speak.\n So they told the doctor that I was a prostitute, that I'd been arrested in Hillbrow and when they were trying to arrest me, I ran away, so that's why I got injured.\n So they took me back to Sunset where I was kept.  When I arrived at Sunset, the White wardens there, they were insulting me regular and calling me names.\n I was released on the 1st of December 1988.  After they had released me, there was a person who was posted next to my home to watch on me. I reported this to comrades that I can't even go to the shop, because they were harassing all people.  They were arresting my relatives, asking them, questioning them on what I was.\n So I was all by myself all the time up until my mother sent me to Natal and stay and try and cool off there in Natal for a while.\n When I came back, one person, Mugate was arrested and I was asked to come and give testimony how they tortured us until people agreed to accepting the statements, implicating themselves, although they didn't know anything about that.  One of them threatened that if I talked, I would be killed.",
