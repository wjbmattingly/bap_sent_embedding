<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mitchell, welcome once again.  We have to apologise for having kept you for the best part of the day but as in any, and I'm sure you have been to inquries of this nature, sometimes time logistics is not always a manageable commodity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a> Without further ado, let me introduce the members of the panel.  Commissioner Glenda Wildschut is a Commissioner in the Rehabilitations and Reparations Committee.  I am a Commissioner in the Human Rights Violations Committee and Wilson Magadla to my right is head of Special Investigations in the Commission.  To our right we have the person who has been investigating this case, Chrystelle Terreblanche and with her is Doctor David Klatzow who is contracted to the Commission on a consulting basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a> Evidence led here is of a confidential nature.  It is not for public consumption.  It is taken in camera, precisely because it is intended to be of an investigative nature.  It's an inquiry seeking to probe but we do it under oath in terms of the Act, so that the evidence that we take is evidence by any legal yardstick.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a> Whatever you say here you commit yourself to a version under oath and what is more, it is not the sort of evidence that is going to be used by us in the panel in order for us to arrive at any finding because it is not a trial, it is not a hearing, it is not a disciplinary inquiry, it's is an investigative probe which is why therefore, only people who are in the Commission and people who are contracted by the Commission and those who have come to depose to statements that they have or to lead evidence are permitted and are here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a> Before you testify I will ask Commissioner Wildschut to swear you in, which is what I'm asking her now to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS WILDSCHUT:</span> Could you please state your full names for the record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MICHAEL PETER MITCHELL:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Miss Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS TERREBLANCHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  I think Doctor Klatzow is ready with some questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Doctor Klatzow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Captain Mitchell, you are a long time employed of the South African Airways, a senior member of the flight crews, flight staff, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> You just said Flite Star.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Flight staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Oh, I'm not hearing this very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Sorry.  You are a senior member of the flight crew at SAA, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, thank you, I can hear you now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And you were at the time, in charge of the operations room, that is the time of the Helderberg accident in 1988, you were the most senior flight operational man present in the operations room in charge of the disaster, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Mr Chairman, Mr Commissioner, yes, I was.  I am retired now from the South African Airways.  I was a senior member of South African Airways staff.   At the time, and may I comment on your letter which you sent to me saying that I was Chief of Operations.  That's not ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, that's not what I've put to you.  Could we just go by the question because we've got limited time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You were the man in charge of running that operation that night, from a flight crew point of view.  You weren't the Chief Executive Officer but as an operational man, a flying man, you were the most senior man there that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Who was the more senior flying man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, not, not flying, flying man yes, I was a flying man but not when you say, of the operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Captain Mitchell, listen to the questions very carefully because we're going to save a lot of time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I said you were not the Chief Executive Officer, you were not the most senior man there that night but on the flying side you were the most senior man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And there were various other people there that night who were there to do your bidding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> What time were you notified of the loss of the Helderberg or the potential loss?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I was at home in bed and I would guess around about 2 o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And who phoned you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Can you remember the name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> What did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I got up ...[indistinct] I then phoned Viv Lewis because in actual fact I have pointed this out to you right now, I had been put in the post of Chief Director Flight Operations by 27 days when this accident happened and being new in the post my immediate reporting, Viv Lewis was the Director Flight Operations, he'd just gone into ...[indistinct] at the beginning of the month, so I phoned Viv immediately because I took over his seat at the beginning of the month.  So I phoned him immediately and said: "Viv, the aeroplane's crashed".</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> The moment you were phoned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Oh immediately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Right.  And your words if you remember correctly were: "The aeroplane's crashed"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> That and: "the aircraft has crashed", words to that effect, I can't remember ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> But did the word: "crash" come into it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I can't remember doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well it's likely that if those are the words you used now, that they were the words you used then because foremost in your mind was the aircraft was in the ocean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> We didn't know that at the time, we had to sit down and work out.  The very fact that I got a report from Operations saying that the aircraft is missing ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Captain Mitchell, listen to the question very carefully.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You were phoned just after 2 o'clock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> About, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You immediately picked up the phone and phoned Viv Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And you said to him: "We've lost an aircraft" or words to the effect that the aircraft had crashed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Words to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> That's what I wanted to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Now what did you then do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I then got up and I got in my car and went to the airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And you went to the operations control?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Well that's on the 5th floor, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Is there a ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It's called: "Ops".</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> That's "Ops".</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Correct.  Is there a standard way of dealing with this situation in airlines in flying circles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Are you talking today or then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Then</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Just can I finish my line of questioning, and if there's anything which I have not traversed, you are most welcome to cover it, but please, there will be plenty of time for you to make whatever submissions you want to make.  Are you aware that there is a lost tape?  Whether it contained anything or not is not part of the question, are you aware that a tape went missing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I feel very strongly about a discussion on something that possibly didn't happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> So are you... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no, no, I don't think that's the inquiry.  I'm indebted to you for everything that you have said about the recent trip.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But we have had an enquiry and over and above an enquiry if one of the findings of which was that either the tape went missing or was overtaped, so we on our ...(indistinct) let's forget about those factors which we in fact are in, I mean it's on the record now, we have to consider it in our consideration of all the evidence that has been placed before us.  I think let's give Dr Klatzow and all of us an opportunity to go step by step, one thing we are taking now into account what you have said, but maybe let's take it step by step and see what, I mean, I think here we're talking about something physical.  Was there or was there not a tape that went missing, and all evidence that I've heard thus far including evidence from Gert van der Veer was that there is as acknowledgement that this happened.  The previous witness, there is an acknowledgement that this happened.  So, maybe let's take it step by step. Dr Klatzow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Thank you, Chairman.  Now, Mr Mitchell, Captain Mitchell, undeniably a tape somehow got out of sequence and went missing.  Do you have any explanation as to how that came to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Dr, no, the handing of the tape is not part of - I had people working for me and so I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Was the tape ever handed to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't know when you say "the" tape, there were tapes handed to me, yes, and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> The tape from ZUR and the logbook?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> The tape and the logbook were - not together, they didn't come together, we started collecting data in the morning when the sun came, the Administrative Director came and got the medical files and got the training files and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> That is our information, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> And started putting them together.  There's a whole lot of things that came through, it included the log.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And the tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, I don't think the tape came in then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, do you remember that Captain Jimmy Deal was there at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Jimmy Deal has said that he was there at that stage and he was sent to fetch the tape, do you disagree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm not disagreeing ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And would it be the sort of likely thing that would have happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It's - Jimmy was then part of Management.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, I had that difficulty in the process, but who actually did it, you know, I would say ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And Jimmy Deal's information is that he handed the tape to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Well, I got the tapes, yes ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You got that tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't know who brought them to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Let's assume Jimmy Deal is right, Jimmy Deal says he handed you, Captain Mickey Mitchell the ZUR tape and the logbooks, not necessarily together, but you had them in your hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Probably separately, but I had them in my hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Correct, what did you do with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> We were collecting all the data, firstly the written stuff put together in the files and the Administrative Director, a man called Dicky Rouxcastle, put it in his office, was alongside mine, and we put them together and locked them up because we knew Rene van Zyl from DCA would be coming and when the tape came, Dr, when, I'm not sure when the tapes came, we took it and locked it up in that file - there was a lock-up file, not a file, a lock-up cabinet in the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> That is correct.  And who had the keys to that cabinet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Dicky Rouxcastle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Now, that tape,</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> The last person to have had that tape was you in the official records of this enquiry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> When the tape went missing, did anybody speak to you about that missing tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Can we rephrase that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Alright, I was there when Dicky Rouxcastle put it into the steel cabinet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Then Civil Aviation came along and I believe in the form of Mr Rene van Zyl and one or two others, and I can't remember, I think a man called Piet de Klerk, I'm not sure of this Dr, I think so.  When he came along we game it to them all, and they signed for it.  So, I'm saying one thing about you said that was the last written record of the event, that's not correct ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I'll get to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It was signed for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I'll get to that.  Let me ask you about the tapes.  Describe the tape physically to the Commissioner, is it big, is it small?  It's not a cassette player?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It's a big tape and it has a plastic box ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It's like a video, a video, that kind of size.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It has a box that it lives in, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And on that box is written information about the tape, the date of the tape, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I know about it, I can't say ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> But you had it in your hand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And you would not just accept the tape, you would check to see that it was the right tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You wouldn't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I handed it to Dicky Rouxcastle who wrote the date on his card and put it down there together in the cabinet.  No, I gave it to Dick.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Subsequently it wasn't Rene van Zyl who came and asked, it was Roy Downs who came and asked for the tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And he was told that the tape went missing.  Did you ever convey that to Mr van der Veer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Who told that the tape - I'm not aware of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, accept for a moment that the tape was recognisably missing at the time that DCA made their enquiry, accept that, because that is what the evidence will be.  Did you ever tell Mr Gert van der Veer that the tape was missing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I didn't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Did Mr van der Veer ever approach you and say, why is this tape missing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> The next sequence round of this would have been, I know Rene van Zyl came to the office and spoke about it.  I'm not aware of Roy Downs, but there was somebody with Rene, they came to the office and said, what happened to the tapes - no, he came to the office to say it has been blanked over, there's nothing on it.  So I said, Rene, I'm not aware of this, and he then said, no, just explain all that, so I said, Rene, I just really don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Did you ever get in front of Mr Gert van der Veer and explain to him why the tape had gone missing or was overtaped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I went further than that because Mr Lewis was sort of Head of Air Operations, then I said to him, Mr Lewis, this tape has got nothing on it and he had a work with me, what's going on here.  And then Mr van der Veer, I did - I'm not conscious of talking directly to him, but I do know Viv probably, I'm saying probably, Dr, would have told him, and I know Mr van der Veer said to me, that's not good enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> So here's a potentially vital piece of information which goes missing which has caused the airline untold trouble in the last 10 years, and you're aware of that trouble.  It resulted in the Judge expressing his displeasure at the hearing, you were the man in control of that tape, it got lost in inexplicably out of your control and Mr van der Veer says to you, tst, tst, tst, this is just not good enough.  Mr Mitchell, I have extreme difficulty in believing your version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Alright, let's go back to the beginning of - that's exactly where I came in, Dr.  I said there was nothing on the tape in the beginning, hence the reason  for the unimportance of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Did you listen to it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> How did you know there was nothing on it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> There was nothing on the log.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Did you listen to the tape, Mr Mitchell, answer my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I did answer, I said no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> How could you then say that there was nothing on the tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Because there was nothing in the log.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, that could have been that the communication on the tape was never written into the log.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> That's highly unlikely, Dr.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It isn't highly unlikely, particularly ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It is unlikely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, we'll deal with that in due course as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> So therefor I come back to my original premise, the premise is that if we knew there was evidence of the tape because of the log I can assure you that everything would have been done, exactly done, but because there was no HF communication, which I've explained to the Commissioner, there was nothing on the tape from the aircraft.  Hence the reason of the low priority of the tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Right, there was nothing about the Helderberg on the tape, or there was nothing at all on the log?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, there was log and aeroplanes, other little aeroplanes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> What else was on the log?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I can't tell you, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Was there information that an aircraft had lost an engine at Seoul I think it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I really can't remember, Dr.  If I look at the log, I'd tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes, so you say that the reason that you placed no store by the tape is that there was nothing on the log?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> With respect this aeroplane, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Right, at the Margo Enquiry, Mr Mitchell, there was a brouhaha about the missing tape, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> There was extensive cross-examination of Mr Nadel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> The conversation between the Judge, between the Prosecutor, Mr Nadel became quite nasty, do you remember that, where Mr Southwood accused Mr Nadel of lying.  It's in the record, he said, "You are making all of this up, aren't you?"  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> You're reminding me of it, I read it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.  You were sitting in the audience when that was there, weren't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You heard the full conversation between the Judge and between everybody else.  Did you ever see fit to advise Mr Puckrin, who was acting for the legal advisors of SAA that you had been the last person and that you had locked it up in the safe, and to offer and explanation as to how that tape went missing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Did you ever tell Mr Puckrin that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm gonna think now whether ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It's an important thing, it's not something that would escape your memory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It can quite easily, it's 10 years ago.  The lawyers came down from Barlow, Lyde and London and were with Mr Puckrin and the lawyers and they - I know I was asked about the tape and Dr, I would rather not give you inaccurate information than half a story, I am sure that Cedric Puckrin knew about the tape and the process of the tape and that the tape had come from ZUR to be locked up to go to DCA and then go - I'm sure he knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well then, if that is the case, Captain Mitchell, can you give me one explanation why he kept that vital piece of evidence from His Lordship, Mr Justice Margo?  Because that is a vital piece of evidence I want to put to you, and that was never raised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> But you're exactly right, Dr, exactly right, because the Judge and the five pilots who were on that Commission knew quite clearly that there was nothing on that tape because there was no call from the aircraft.  Hence the reason the low priority of the tape.  I say again, it's a very low priority factor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> With great respect to you, Mr Margo was there to evaluate the evidence, not to pre-judge it.  The word prejudice means to pre-judge,</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And Mr Margo was there to hear whatever evidence there was, he expressed annoyance, Mr Mitchell, that the tape had gone missing.  Why do you think that he would express annoyance at the Commission for a tape which had no value?  Why would he say, I want to get to the bottom of this, who lost the tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It was not a good way of processing the process, I accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> So he was expressing annoyance not at the loss of the tape, but at the slack administration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I will accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Why did you never stand up at the Commission having heard the debate about the missing tape and say, I had that, I locked it in the safe, Judge, why don't you ask the next man where it went to.  Why did you never say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I come back again, that was passed on to Mr van der Veer, to Viv Lewis, to DCA to Rene van Zyl.  Rene van Zyl as the investigator asked that of me, and exactly what I said to him, and I presume as the investigator, that's exactly what he knew, and he's the investigator, Rene van Zyl never investigated, it was the DCA who investigated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Rene van Zyl made enquiries about that tape only three weeks after the accident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> That tape was taken out the night of the accident and placed in your hand, and by your evidence placed in a safe place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I - can you tell me, I'm not sure whether it was that night, I'm not sure at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It was that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Now how do we know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Because Captain Deal told me he took it out and gave it to you and I can't imagine you walking around SAA with that under your arm or in your pocket for 24, 48 or 72 hours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I accept - unfortunately Captain Deal can't answer you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Unfortunately he can't, but unfortunately I have a tape recording of him telling me that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> That's wonderful, but the point about it, he can't corroborate it, and I don't know it was that night or the next morning or the following morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> If it was the next morning, does it make a difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It does.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> What is the difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It's what you made, the difference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> What is the difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> You just said it now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> The tape was in your hands, sorry the panel wishes to ask a question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADHLA:</span> When was it, Mr Mitchell, that it was discovered that the tape had nothing on it, was it before it was locked up in that cupboard or was it when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Mr Magadhla, the tape was brought, to answer your question directly, probably sometime later, because it went to Civil Aviation, they took the tape and they played it.  Then they came back and said there was nothing on the tape.  As far as I know, nobody in South African Airways played the tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADHLA:</span> When you had the tape locked up then, was it after it had been discovered that it had nothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, no, the tape, sir, came from ZUR, whoever went to go and get it, go and get the tape, and I remembered this as an afterthought, it wasn't part of my priorities at all, in fact, it didn't fit very high on the whole discussion as I mentioned, I don't want to labour the point, that HF transmission didn't happen, so it didn't mean a thing in my life.  And I stand on that point, and when we locked it up, and I really don't know when, it could have been - I don't think it was the next morning, but I know we got the log and it got locked up.  When DCA came, Mr DCA, it could have been a person from or persons from DCA to come and get all the information, then we gave it to them, and then they came back to us a time later, I'm sorry I'm not accurate with the time, sir, it's a time later, then they came back and said there's nothing on there.  And this wasn't that night, it wasn't a week later, probably even a month later, am I right, yes, it's about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> That is absolutely correct, DCA came to you a month later, but they were not given a tape that was taped over, they were given a tape of the wrong day, Captain Mitchell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm aware of that now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes, now, that's the issue I want to get to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No 1, the tapes are clearly marked,</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No 2, that tape was in and under your control.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Dicky Rouxcastle actually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You were the man who was at the Head of the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I have many people who work for me, Dr Klatzow, I can assure you I had a good deal more that to worry about locking up a tape, I have a highly responsible Director Administration, of very very ...(indistinct) experience.  He locked it up there, I knew it was there and I was quite happy that he did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Did you ever go to Mr Rouxcastle and say to him, what happened to the tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I can - I was with him when DCA came to fetch all the documents because the signed for it, and also, the tape wasn't lost, can we correct that, you've just said it was another tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes, well tell me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> If anything, it was taped over again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> So we can establish that as a more accurate process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, we're going to deal with that, because if that were the case, Margo was never informed of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, his finding made the following conclusion, "The tape was either taped over inadvertently or lost".  Now, if the tape had been inadvertently taped over, it was perfectly possible for you, Captain Mitchell or one of the other people who along the line of tape, to address the Judge through your legal advisor and said, Judge, the tape has been taped over, there was an administrative error, here is the tape.  Why did you never do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Will you say that again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> If the tape - the Judge's findings were quite unequivocal, they were to the effect that the tape had either been taped over or lost.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> If the tape, as you have unequivocally stated under oath now, had been taped over, what stopped you from going to the Judge through your legal advisor and saying, Judge, there is the tape, there is the markings on it which identifies the tape of that day, we have blued and taped it over.  What would stop you doing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Let me just correct you there, Dr Klatzow.  You said that I've just said unequivocally under oath that the tape was taped over, I did not say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> What did you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I said that is a possibility that it was taped over, I gave the indication, I did not say it was taped over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Captain Mitchell, I would like to have the record played back, but that is not what you said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What you said actually, Captain Mitchell, was that the correct position is not that the tape was lost, but that it was taped over.  It was not stated as a possibility.  It was in fact stated as fact as an effort to correct an impression that it is either/or ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Either lost.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  You were very emphatic about that, that's what we wanted to say by being stated unequivocally.  It is your considered opinion, not opinion, statement or fact actually that it was not lost, it was taped over.  If you want to revise that opinion ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, I think probably you said it better than I have, yes.  No, I accept that, you said it better than I have, but to answer the question for Dr Klatzow, he said why didn't I tell the Judge, sir, that's what the investigator's job is, he had the tape and he knew that, and it was his job as the investigator to tell the Judge, not my job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Captain Mitchell, you were the man in the hot seat, you were the man who had the tape in your hands, your were the man who could have provided an explanation whilst the hot debate was raging in court.  You never did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sorry, I don't agree with you.  The tape was with the investigator.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, the tape got to the investigator from your hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, but the tape was in the hands of the investigator ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It was the wrong tape, Captain Mitchell.</p>

<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It was the wrong tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm sorry, I don't see the point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You gave the DCA investigators the wrong tape.  You didn't give them a taped over tape, you gave them a tape of the next day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm not aware, I'm not aware of that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was put to you just - I think you must be - okay, Captain Mitchell it may be at the end of a long day, but I think you must allow yourself to listen to what is being put to you because some of it may escape you if you are not listening.  Dr Klatzow did say to you that that was the wrong tape because, I think he said it was the tape of the previous day, or the next day, and then you seemed to accept that because you didn't contest it.  I think he's putting it to you now, that what you gave to DCA ...(intervention)</p>

<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the wrong tape in that it did not pertain to the day and issue, and you seem to be confirming that by saying that the tape in fact that was relevant is the one that was run over.  Do you understand what I'm saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Then you're saying there were two tapes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There were two tapes, the one you gave DCA, which is why they returned it to say, look there's nothing on this tape, it was because it was not the tape in issue.  If you want to place that in contest, if you are contesting that, then maybe do so as you answer questions that are being put to you.  I think there are two propositions now, when you continue to say the tape was returned and it was returned by DCA on the basis that it contained nothing, he is in the in the clause of putting questions to you, saying it was the wrong tape which is why it was being returned to you, and that is why the tape that was in issue became an issue because people then began to say, look you have given us a wrong tape because it is not relevant to the day in question, give us the correct tape, and then was the occasion for you to say, by the way that tape has been run over.  That's where the controversies has lied all along, but then let's take it step by step, Dr Klatzow, I don't want to break your trend of trying to build up to whatever points you want to build up, but I just wanted to say to Mr Mitchell, maybe you should give yourself time to listen what he's asking, and not anticipate where he's trying to get to because once you begin to anticipate you'll find that you are answering questions that are anticipated and the you reply to questions that have not been put.  And I think what is troubling you is that you preceded in the whole enquiry by proposing a theory that says there was an open decision, because on the basis of what - of the experience that you are talking about.  Disabuse your mind for the moment of anything that you have ...(indistinct) of a type of theory and try and see if, you know, in the course of, you know, a controlled conversation of this nature, you are going to be able to concede or still take the views that put, but don't anticipate questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Thank you, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Dr Klatzow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Back where we were.  Captain Mitchell, there was a hot debate in Margo's court about the disappearing tape.  You could provide that court with at least one step of the path of that tape.  You did not do so, is there a reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Furthermore, will you concede that your version that the tape was accidentally overtaped is highly unlikely, because Cedric Puckrin is well-known to me.  Had he been provided with that evidence he would have said, bring me the tape, I'll show it to the Judge and that would have been put to the Judge that it had been overtaped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm not aware of what Mr Puckrin would have done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I am aware that he would have done that, because it is the obvious thing to have and only a fool wouldn't have done it, and Puckrin is no fool.  That is the thing to have done, and yet Margo was left with the impression that it was either overtaped or mysteriously disappeared.  Why did you never correct that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Probably because what the Commissioner said, I had a preconception, that I know from my experience, that there was nothing ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> So are we to believe that you gave Margo evidence based on your preconceptions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> On my experience.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> On your preconceptions are the words you used, you had a preconceived notion that there was nothing on that tape, having never listened to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> And also having read the log.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Only read the log?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Now, Captain Mitchell,</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Were you ever phoned by me in my capacity as an investigator for the Sunday Star, in Mauritius?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> You mean in Mauritius?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, we spoke ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Have you had a conversation with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Did I raise the issue of a tape with you before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Did you phone once or twice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I phoned you twice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> One in Jo'burg here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, in Mauritius.  Did you ever - do you remember that I raised the issue to you relating to the tape with you?  If you can't remember, I'll provide you the transcript of the conversation, because I tape-recorded it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Really?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>

<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Do you remember that I said to you, what did you tell the Margo Enquiry, and you said to me at the time, and I'm going to quote you closely, you said,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>"What I say now is exactly what I told the Margo Commission."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>What did you tell the Margo Commission about that tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Well, when you say the Margo Commission, I probably ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> The Margo Enquiry, under oath in court, what did you tell them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't think they asked me about that in court, Dr.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You told them nothing, Mr Mitchell, absolutely nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> That's just what I'm agreeing with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Why did you then tell me in my previous conversation with you that you would say exactly the same before?  Did you mean to me that you would say nothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I put Rene van Zyl and the enquiry in the same discussion as the whole process of looking into the accident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> So I would have seen that as one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Rene wasn't South African Airways, he was doing the duty of the State, and that's Judge Margo too, so those are together, that's not part of South African Airways.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Now Jimmy Deal had something else very interesting to say,</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> He said to me that he handed the tape into your hand and that you were in the company of Gert van der Veer and Malherbe, their legal advisor.  Do you deny that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't - I very clearly - had they been standing - no, Dicky Rouxcastle was with me, no.  Rouxcastle was with me when ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And you never gave it to Van der Veer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, definitely not, categorically not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Let me canvass another point with you, does the name Jimmy Mouton mean anything in your life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, he went to school with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> What was his function at the Airways?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Flight Engineer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Did he fly with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Oh, lots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Did you know him well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Was he a good man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, Jimmy's a good chap.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Was he a fool?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Well, you know, I've known Jimmy a long time and he's a good man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> He's a good man?  Did he have extensive cockpit experience?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Was he an irrational man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Did you say irrational?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Irrational.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> He's not irrational, he's ...(intervention)</p>

<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> He's excitable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I understand that.  Did you know a man called Judge Bredas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Did you know Peter de Beer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, that's all the Union.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Did you know Ray Scott?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> They all of the Union, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Correct.  Were they fools?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, the were normal Flight Engineers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> They were good Flight Engineers, they were men with whom the safety of passengers was entrusted, almost to the same extent as a pilot on an aircraft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Probably that's taking it a bit far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, they were men who bore a responsible job, and they knew the functionings of a cockpit, is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> They're Flight Engineers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> They're Flight Engineers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, they may be a lower species, Captain Mitchell, than you are, but they were men who spent a lot of time in the cockpit and would have known what went on in the cockpit, is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Those are your words, a lower species.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm suggesting what you're implying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I didn't imply that at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, let's get to the question, is it likely that they would know what went on in the cockpit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Oh yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And that whatever they had to say about the interpretation of what went on in the cockpit was something to be taken seriously, not the ravings of a fool?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I would always listen to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.  Are you aware that that group of men prepared a report,</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> On the electrical systems?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> On the events as they went on in the cockpit and they placed a different interpretation on those events to that which was coming out on the Margo Enquiry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I've never seen this - in the back of my head I think I may know about it, but I definitely haven't seen this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Were you ever in Margo's chambers when Ray Scott, Judge Bredas and Jimmy Mitten were called into Judge Margo's chambers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm not aware where Judge Margo's chambers are, I think they're in the Supreme Court, I'm not aware,</p>

<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Can you deny that you were present when Judge Margo called them in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I met - Dr, I remember going to being called to Judge Margo's house,</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> And I've been trying to think why I was called there and I do believe now, I mean, believing, because I can't remember the actual - there was somebody else or two people came out their motorcar, because they had been to see Judge Margo, and they were from the Airline and I think, I just think, sir, I think it was Jimmy Mouton plus, plus one, I'm not sure of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Right, well, Jimmy Mouton tells me that he was called to Judge Margo's chambers.  Now, I don't want to debate with you whether it's his house or his chambers, because that could very well be the vagaries of memory, but they were summoned to Margo's presence, and you were present, and you've confirmed that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I remember that, I can't, you know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Do you remember what Margo said to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, I really would tell you if I knew, I've got nothing to hide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well I'm going to tell you what Ray Scott says that Margo said to them.</p>

<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>he now flies for Pheonix Air, this was some years ago, '95, he plus Mouton plus Judge Bredas plus Ray Scott were called into Margo's chambers and told to drop the enquiry that the were pursuing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> They were told that it could cost the country R400 million rand, which co-incidentally is the cost of a Boeing at that time, they were told that it was causing tension, they were told that they did not have the expertise and that national security was at risk.  Present were, Mickey Mitchell, Margo, the Airline lawyer and he thinks the DCA was there,</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> And he thinks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> The DCA, he was quite emphatic that you were there and you've confirmed that.</p>

When I drove in and I remember his house next to King Edwards and these people - and I remember them as Flight Engineers, I think Jimmy Mittens was there - I can't - I don't think I was ever in a meeting with the four of them or, who did the other one you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well do you think Ray Scott is lying?</p>

<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> We'll get to that in due course.  Are you aware that there's a thing in the aircraft called a cockpit voice recorder?</p>

<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You're aware too that it records the last half hour of conversation in the aircraft?</p>

<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Correct.  But in that aircraft it recorded the last half hour,</p>

<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You're aware that on that recording there was a discussion involving dinner being served in the cockpit, are you aware of that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> To the passengers and to the cockpit crew.</p>

<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Nice word peace meal.  I would be - what time did the aeroplane get airborne?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> About just after 1 o'clock our time.</p>

<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> How long have you being flying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> 40 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> How many meals have you been served as a proper meal at the top of descent, or just before the top of descent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> A fair number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well this is very interesting evidence, because everybody that I have spoken to, including people who should know,</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Gert van der Veer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> He's a pilot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, but he flies a lot, and he's a man who should know what goes on, many other pilots, and I can give you their names,</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, I'd like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I will in due course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I'm not going to do it now, but many people have told me that it is extremely unlikely that a meal be served in the cockpit just outside Mauritius.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> May I give you another point of view if I may, Commissioner, you're suggesting that just prior to going down somebody asked for his meal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, that's not what I suggested, Captain Mitchell, listen to the question.  A meal was being served to the cockpit crew, not somebody asked for a meal, a meal was being served to everybody in the cockpit.  Now you've read that tape-recording,</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Ages ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Well I want to put it to you prevaricating, because it's quite clear from that tape-recording that a meal was being served to everybody in the cockpit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> You had things to eat on the way down if you wanted to you, can I - will you let me just talk a little bit and tell you about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes, let me hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> If you had a crew coming out of Taipei, you have a double crew and what would happen is that probably the first part of the crew - no, let's talk, the first part of the crew would sleep in the afternoon and the second crew would operate the aeroplane to about halfway.  Now, that means that they would fly 4/5 hours, then the crew would change over.  Now, the decision was that at that stage there, Dr, is that when you - they would have been feeding passengers, but as crew you would eat meals, your own meal, the hot/cold meals whatever you felt like, you'd call for it yourself.  You don't have to eat with everybody else, because your time frame's out, you're in Taipei time, you're not in South African time, you'd eat at all the wrong times of the day, so when you're hungry, you call for your meal.  And that's what happens, so probably a crew flew halfway and then they changed over, so that man or men, they went into the bunks and the next crew got into the operating, and then they and just before ...(indistinct) and it's 25 minutes for a descent or probably 5 or 10 minutes before then, the people would be woken up, they're going to go down and say, bring me my meal and he'd have his meal, and that is quite normal, I have done this hundreds of times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Who was the pilot on-board that aircraft?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Dawie Uys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Who would have flown it out of Taipei?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, is it not likely that the captain would have done so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, why, there's three pilots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Who was the main engineer aboard that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Joe Bellagada.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, that doesn't follow - we changed all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> He was the main engineer aboard that aircraft, he was the senior man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Your point is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Joe Bellagada, Dawie Uys and other members of the crew were being served a meal and every indication was that it was part of the normal meal service, it was not something which happened in an unusual way such as you described, and inter alia, let me just finish, inter alia Jimmy Mouton and the Flight Engineers Association interpreted that meal in exactly the same way as I've interpreted it, namely that it was a meal served in the normal course of events and would have been served shortly after that aircraft reached its cruising altitude.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> For the crew that were there, yes, the operating crew, but not for the crew who had gone to the bunks already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It wasn't the crew in the bunks, it was in the cockpit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, sorry, the bunker is next to the cockpit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It was in the cockpit, it was recorded in the cockpit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> But I have no difficulty with that, I'm agreeing with you, I'm agreeing with you.  The crew in the cockpit, those three would have got their meal, but they would have eaten and flown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well are you suggesting that that meal was served half way between Taipei and Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> That could at ...(indistinct) or anywhere.  You eat when you want to, you're not - there's no mealtimes, Dr.  When you're flying, you eat when you want to eat.  I personally don't eat probably for the first six hours when I'm flying, for a reason ...(intervention)</p>

I do no lie, I can tell you I've been flying for 42 years and I've got dozens of people who will do exactly the same as I will, dozens, in this Airline where I'm flying dozens, they do not eat at one time, they eat when they feel like it, they change when they like, my stomach is not the same as yours, so I object to that, Dr ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Precisely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Please, sir, I object to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Have you lodged your objection Captain Mitchell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Precisely the point that your stomachs are not the same would be most unlikely for everybody whose stomachs are not the same to be being served a meal somewhere in the middle of this flight just at top of descent as you would have this Commission believe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Not unreasonable, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It is totally unreasonable.</p>

<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Is that your answer Captain Mitchell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Right, now, are you - will you accept that at least one interpretation that can be put on the fact that a meal was being served was that that flight recorder stopped functioning nearer Taipei than to Mauritius, will you accept that that is one possibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> One of the others too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Would you accept that it is one possibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It's unlikely.</p>

<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> We know that there is a discussion about a dinner on that tape-recording.</p>

<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was that all about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sir, that exactly - I was scratching my head to find a reason as to - I know I was there because I know how to get to his house, I hadn't been there before, and I've been thing of what is the reason I went there.  I'm not a friend of Judge Margo at all, so I was never a visiting friend or anything like that, so I went there for a purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it at his invitation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, definitely, I wouldn't go there otherwise, oh, definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you think you might find it possible to recall what it was all about?  I say so because, you know, there is another proposition that is being put,</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it's a very serious proposition, it comes from more than one witness who state that the whole enquiry was sought to be derailed by a Judge who for good or for bad reasons had felt that it was in the national interest, no less, that certain evidence should be suppressed, that, you know, the enquiry should be led in a different direction that that which the evidence might point, and that certain people were being persuaded to take certain position which ...(indistinct) would not liked to have taken.  Now, and therefor you are one of the people who is indicated to as having been present when this was made, and where you deny that, and I can live with your denying, but where in the process of denying that particular meeting you say, no, the only time that I ever visited Margo was when I went to his home.  And why I'm asking is because I'm quite concerned that a Judge who is presiding in any enquiry of that nature should actually be visited, at his own invitation, at his home in circumstances where it might suggest that he was placing himself in a very invidious position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> An invidious position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I take note of that Commissioner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Dr Klatzow?  I'm just saying maybe it will be in all our interest for you to remember exactly what it was, you see, that you ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I give you my word, if I get it there, I'm here, I've got nothing to hide, I'm at your behest, sir, but I - there's just something that I remember driving in and I can't put my finger on it what we were there for, I'd rather not say it was that or this, because I actually - is it possible to approach the Judge and ask him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We can explore that, but from all accounts it looks like the Judge is a bit on the old side now, he's very senile.  Anyway, you said it was you, who else was there, you said when "we"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I was by myself when I - I went there by myself.  And when I got out my car I remember a car drove out, to my memory, I think it was ...(indistinct), but again, I don't want to point fingers at somebody and I'm not sure who it was, but I know I went there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you recall also that as you went in some people were leaving and it is your considered opinion, though doubtful that it must have been Flight Engineers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, again, in the light of what is being put, you see ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I get your point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the light of what is being put, it's again quite something that is very worrisome, that a Judge was who was presiding should - and if it was at his invitation that you and those Flight Engineers obviously were at his invitation at the place, and I want to put the other proposition, and this what I put to Gert yesterday, that we must take into account what the times were at which we were living in those days.  It is not far- fetched, it may, in 1998, appear to be far-fetched for a suggestion to be made that a Judge could have made a proposition of that nature, but when you take into account what happened in this country, when evidence was placed by an advocate of a Senior Counsel, for instance in the case of the Harms Commission, before the Harms Commission, evidence that was placed over a long period - against the bedrock of public confessions that had been made by certain individuals about the prevalence of hit squads, evidence which was rejected as being false, but which has not been proved in every single event by the perpetrators coming forward, and many others, to show that it was not just an act of a few bad applies, it was a prevalence, the nature of which we deal in this particular chamber, day in and day out in an expression by way of amnesty applications.  So those sort of things are not far-fetched, and that a Judge could have make a proposition like that is not fare-fetched, and it is our experience from what has been put before us in the course of this enquiry that people were frightened then, and still are frightened now because of the sort of environment that was created by suggestions which, it is our view, made by this Judge that it is not in the national interest for certain information to be made available for that Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a> So, it is absolutely and critically important that you should endeavour to recall why it was that you went to see Judge Margo at his house, at his invitation, at a crucial time when the presiding officer should have stayed away from private conversations of any nature whatsoever which involves people who were potentially witnesses before you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Thank you, Chair, for explaining it, I've not been up to speed on the Truth Commission processes living in Mauritius, so I would thank you for that background.  I certainly would endeavour every single bit to scratch my head during the next discussion that come and if something recalls there, I give - I'm under oath, I give you my solemn word that I will tell you, I've got nothing to hide, I've got nothing to pretend, I didn't do anything wrong, and believe me, if there's anything at all I can help, I will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Dr Klatzow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Captain Mitchell, if a conversation about the Engineers Report was had with you, it would be something that you would remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> There were two reports, you know?  There was a very serious report about the Boeing, about the problems on the electrical systems and how to de-activate the electrical systems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Please answer my question.  Had the Flight Engineers given you a report about a meal being served at a different interpretation on board the aircraft, you would have remembered that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Probably, Dr.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Had the Flight Engineers had an altercation with you or had you been in any way heated about this report, you would have remembered that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I had a fairly good number of arguments with the Flight Engineers Association because I represented SAA, so I ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I'm talking about the report relating to the Margo Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm not aware of this one, Dr.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Is there any reason why the Flight Engineers would wish to incriminate you or to get you involved unnecessarily or to falsely accuse you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I can't see why they should</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Of course they couldn't.  I now want to read to you what Jimmy Mittens says,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>"A teams comprising my brother and Andre Halt, both Flight Engineers, helped me analyse.  We unanimously said the investigation went down the wrong track, we believe to this day that there were two fires aboard that plane and at that stage we did not know that the ZUR tapes went missing.  We submitted out report and immediately realised we were standing on toes.  We summoned to SAA, Mickey Mitchell, Chief Pilot from the SAA Safety Officer asked us if we were accusing him of saying that the pilot, Captain Uys was told to fly on despite the fire.  We hadn't even thought of it at that stage."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>Do you remember that conversation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Is there any reason why Mittens would lie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't want to call people liars, Dr, but inaccuracy probably.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I don't think so, I think that they would confirm that under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, but inaccurate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MS WILDSCHUT:</span> Excuse me, I just want to say that he said this to me - this is something he said to me very recently and he was very passionate about it and said he would do that under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I have no difficulty, maam, but I don't recall this, I really don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I want to put it to you, Captain Mitchell, that the reason that you cannot recall that is not because your memory is fading, because you have quite a clear memory of many of the things which you've testified to today, I want to put it to you that the reason that you disavow any knowledge of this, is because there are extremely sinister implications which could very well involve you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm sorry, I don't agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And that one of the implications is that a vital tape, which you claim nothing was on, despite the fact that you hadn't listened to it, went missing after it was in your care, and you'd passed it on to somebody else, and that you never informed the Margo Commission of the steps of this tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sorry, sir, I did, via Rene van Zyl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You were in the witness box, you had heard the conversation, you had every opportunity to say to the Judge, Judge - you were discussing the tape immediately before my presentation, I had that tape, it was locked in the safe, and this man had the keys and he's the man you should ask about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Don't you think Rene van Zyl would have done that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I'm not asking what Rene van Zyl would have done.  I want to know why you didn't do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sorry, sir, that's not my job, that's his job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I differ, I differ, I differ, I differ, Mr Mitchell.  In a Commission nobody has a job like there is a job description.  In a Commission, especially in a Commission, more than in fact in a court of law, in a commission you endeavour to bring information to the attention of the Commission that might be germane to the issues being thrashed out, and that might assist the Commission to arrive at a fair and a balanced verdict.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I'm sure you now appreciate, if you had brought that information to the attention of the Commission then we would certainly not be here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, you're right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, why didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> As I say, in my ignorance, Dr, I'm not aware of Commissions or acts, this is the first one I've ever been to, is that I assume that the investigator has sent a lot of time with the Judge explaining things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, I want to put something else to you, Captain Mitchell,</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> When we started this discussion over an hour ago, you attempted to convince the Commission that the tape had been taped over, you put it as a fact, and remember, you are under oath, that the tape had been taped over, not that it had been lost.  You went out of your way to correct me in my statement to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't think we'll ...(indistinct) I'll say again ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> So you think it was taped over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Then please tell the Commissioner why it is that you didn't show the remains of the tape, and I'm going to give you a very logical reason why you didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You answer my question firs, I'm asking the questions, Captain Mitchell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> You asked two now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Why is it that you did not give the empty tape to the Commissioner at the time, Margo, if that is what you said?  Tell me why you didn't give that tape to him, and if the tape was lost, why did you try to convince this Commission that it had been taped over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Can I just come back to your first question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Your first question is, why didn't I give the tape to the Commission.  Now, when Rene van Zyl came back and said there's nothing on the tape, I can't remember that we accepted the tape back into SAA.  In fact, I'm pretty sure that tape is locked up in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that wouldn't be the reason for you not producing the tape, whether it was in Pretoria or anywhere else.  And in any event, we've dealt with the question of the tape that was brought back by the DCA people.  That tape was brought back on the basis that it was the tape relevant to a date other than the one in question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a> I think the question is relevant to the tape which you, under oath, have sought to say to us was taped over, why was that tape not produced by you at the Enquiry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> But sir ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As proof of the fact that it was taped over, it was an inadvertence, but there it was, end of the story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, Commissioner, the point I make is that came back, Rene van Zyl said there's nothing on this tape, about the Helderberg ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you are not answering the question, Mr Mitchell,</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm missing the point, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's deal with one question first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the basis of your own evidence today, namely that that tape, the crucial tape, the ZU tape, whatever it is called, had been taped over.  Now that tape about which all of us are in agreement, I'm talking about the tape that was claimed to have been lost when in fact it had not been lost, but had been taped over, the question is, why did you not make that tape available to the Commission as evidence of the fact that there should be no issue as to what happened to the tape, it was not lost, it's here, it's physically here, except that it won't contain anything, even if the anything is nothing.  It is here, we taped over it, here is that tape, why didn't you do that, that's the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Commissioner, I do not think that tape is in the hands of SAA at all, it remains in the hands of the investigator who is Mr Rene van Zyl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That still doesn't answer the question, why didn't you when you gave evidence say, look the tape is available,</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was taped over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Captain Mitchell, I'm going to advance a suggestion to you,</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> If the tape had been taped over and you'd given it to the Commissioner, you may remember that there was a small unpleasantness called Watergate, which resulted in the impeachment of President Nixon, and part of the reason that Nixon was impeached, was that they were able to uncover information from tapes that had been re-taped over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Now, if the tape had been taped over, which I find inexplicable,</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It can happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Of course it can.  Why didn't you give it to Margo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> But I didn't have it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Neither did DCA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> But DCA did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Let me ask you this question, because let's deal with that point, what did Rene van Zyl say to you when he came back with the tapes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> In round words, the tape there had nothing on it to do with the Helderberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well let me tell you what Rene van Zyl said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And this is out of the horse's mouth.  He came back and you were told that it was not the correct tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> "We were then told that the tape was taped over" and his comment is, "I find this really weird".  Now which is true, Captain Mitchell, you're under oath and you've not got a ...(indistinct) of versions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, no, that isn't the same thing, that's exactly what we're saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, it's not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I see it as the same thing, I'm very sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well then why did you never produce the taped-over taped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Because he kept.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> He didn't, it was never given to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, no, no, we're talking at cross-purposes here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, we're not talking cross-purposes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, no, I see what - the tape that went to Rene van Zyl was thought to be the one that was the Helderberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> And it went there, but it had been taped over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> But it was the wrong tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> But it had been taped over and another day was on this tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> So when it came over that the information on that tape pertained to another day,</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> So when he brought the tape back and said, this is the wrong tape,</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> But we said it's not the wrong tape, we gave that to you, that's the one we got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It was the wrong tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And the explanation as the where the right tape was proffered was, is the explanation that you've given us today, that it was taped over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> And that's the one that he took with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No it is not the one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, sorry, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> There are two tapes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sorry, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> There is a tape which was the tape of the following day, which was given to Rene van Zyl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sorry, sir, I don't see it like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We canvassed this point earlier on, and I think you were, in fact, I'm sure you were in agreement that we're talking about two tapes,</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The one tape that was given to the Flight Engineers, I think, is that what Mr van Zyl is?  That tape was the one which was returned to you, it had nothing on it, precisely because it was a tape relevant to a day other than the day in question.  That tape was then returned ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MS TERREBLANCHE:</span> Sorry to intervene, but I think there is a confusion.  There are a number of things, there is the Mauritius conversation, no, there's the CVR ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There's no confusion in the way the evidence was led.  The evidence I understood to be that was when we come to the issue of the tapes that were taken away, there is a tape that was given to Flight Engineers ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> DCA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I mean DCA, that's - DCA was given a tape,</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that tape is the one that was returned on the basis that there was nothing on it.  And earlier on, I think we will agree, that it had nothing on it precisely because it related to a day other than the date in question.  And it is then that earlier on, it was your considered opinion that the tape in fact that had remained, is the tape that had been taped over.  And that is the tape that we're talking about, there are two tapes.  Certainly by way of earlier evidence it was clear that there are two tapes.  Now, as I understand it, you are seeking to say the tape that was taped over is in fact the tape that was given through to Van Zyl and he brought it back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> That's my impression.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, then there's one tape and then I don't know what I do with your earlier evidence which you seemed to be emphatic in trying to ...(inaudible) between the tape that went away and then was returned, and the tape that ought to have remained, except that it had been taped over, which is why you were saying it actually never got lost.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> We never had a lost tape at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Dr Klatzow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, Mr Commissioner, the evidence gets more and more confusing as we go along, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Because, no 1, Margo found, as a fact, that there had been a lost tape, or that it had been transcribed over, sorry, taped over.  He made that as a factual finding, and he made it because you, who was one of the people who could have shed light on it, never said a word about it at the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Then I stand corrected, because if you tell me, I should have, but, my assumption is - then again I come back to the mistake that I thought that DCA would have told the Judge or the problem, so I assumed that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And you were quite happy to sit in court and watch the Judge being mislead and going down a wrong alley without saying a word.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> You think the Judge was misled?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Answer the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I didn't see the Judge being misled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Right, now, you see the difficulty I have with your evidence is as follows, Mr Mitchell, I'm going to tell you from the word go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> There are a number of murky issues that arrived on our doorstep as a result of the loss of that aircraft, and your name is central to several of them.  There was a tape-recording, made of ZUR, which is placed in your hands, which goes missing.  You then give no proper explanation.  In fact, your explanation has been like treading on quicksand, during even this enquiry, you have shifted from one explanation to another, faster than my plodding thoughts can follow you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Hardly plodding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> That's the first thing.  The second, thank you, the second thing is this, that there is a series of statements which implicate you, Captain Mitchell, in something grossly improper in this enquiry, and all you can do is to deny that they occurred, and yet four people will propose under oath that you were somehow involved in suppressing that report ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm sorry, this is dying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think there is a grave problem with the sound system and I don't know - we must get it right.  Do you need time ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Sorry, my microphone was off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I can hear now, that's fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Sorry, my microphone was off.  We have a conversation that Jimmy Mouton claims to have had with you, which has had to be wrung out of him, he didn't rush to me or to anybody else and volunteer this.  It had to be squeezed out of him, painfully and at great anguish to all concerned, which says that you met him and you accused him of the second fire, and you had a fit about the report, that you were upset out the report, and you've conveniently developed an amnesia for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, he said to you: "Here's the report" and you called him in and said: "Are you suggesting that the pilot flew on despite the fire", that's what you said to him and you've forgotten that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> So Mitchell is right, Mittens is a liar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, Mitchell does not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> So you can't gain say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> What does that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, it never ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can't say it never happened, it's just that you do not remember it happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> So in other words, if Jimmy Mittens says it happened, you can't deny that it happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I would be wrong to because I'd be calling him a liar and I don't, I just don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, so it could have happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> If he said so, it could have happened but I don't remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, give me a reason why Mittens would say it happened if it never happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> You know Doctor, I don't know.  If - probably if we sat down and talked about it through with Jerry Mittens and he told me all about it and so forth, I would understand that but ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes, yes.  Well, let's go further Captain Mitchell, there was a report which the Margo Commission never heard, that's fact.  The Margo Commission was never in possession of the Flight Engineer's report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Really?  Why didn't they give it to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Because you and Margo suppressed it, I want to put it to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Oh nonsense.  They could go direct to ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, let's just look at the logic of the whole thing ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, no, no, it's nonsense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> They did go directly to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> They could go anywhere, they could go to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Captain Mitchell, they went directly to Margo and they were intimidated.  That will be will their evidence.  And you have come with a version that you don't remember it but they will say this, four different people will say this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Well, I don't remember Judge Margo meeting with him, I don't, I know I went to his house.  I know I that but I, that's important ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Captain Mitchell, you're getting deeper by the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Because your evidence under oath, not half an hour ago, was that you went to Margo's house for reasons that you cannot remember, that at his house you remember Mittens and the flight engineers having been there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.  Now which is true, what you said to me three minutes ago or what you said earlier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sorry Sir, I have not conflicted it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> The record - Captain Mitchell, the record will be the judge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And I am telling you that you contradicted yourself under oath, which is the true version Captain Mitchell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't see any difference in the versions, I've got no versions.  I'm not here to lie, I'm here to assist and I want to do as best as I can and if I can't remember, I'm just very sorry, I just can't remember and I take note of the very important issue that the Commissioner said about why was I at Judge Margo's house.   Now I take note of that, that's very important.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a> The other issue of talking to the flight engineers and so forth like that, I regularly spoke to flight engineers, that was my job, they came to me about feedback.  I regularly spoke to flight engineers on many, many issues, money, the whole lot and I don't remember this one as a specific one nor do I definitely not remember them being threatened and harassed and things like that, I really don't ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I want to put it to you that that is a very convenient amnesia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm very sorry Sir, as much as I'd like to try, I'd like to help you.  I want to know what happened as much as you do and believe me I have not, I would like to, I'm doing my best as I can to help you down the, I've help you down the load on three things today that I can remember quite clearly of the eating, the meal thing and ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, I want to get to the meal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> And I'm clear about that and I'm correct, I know I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> And I'm also correct about the HF tape and so forth and on that basis, you put your whole discussion on this tape because you've had your basis, your basis wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, no, my basis is not wrong and there is much, much more to the propositions that I'm putting to you than the facts that I've just put to you.  But about the tape recording regarding dinner, you have put to us and to this Commission a version about how you eat your meals in a highly idiosyncratic fashion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sorry Sir, ...[indistinct] many, many, I ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Can I finish my questions, we both can't talk at the same time.  May I finish my question?  You have attempted to explain to this Commission that everybody on SAA and the Pilot's Association and whoever, eat their meals at top of descent, when in fact the true issue is that the meal is primarily served shortly after takeoff and you have not been seen fit to accord proper recognition to the possibility that that tape recorder could have stopped functioning earlier in the day.  And I want to put it to you, there's a reason that you don't want to accept that version because the moment you accept that version, the entire Margo finding goes out of the window Captain Mitchell.  It would be untenable to Margo's finding, that a pilot of Captain Uys' standing experience would fly on from a fire which occurred outside Taipei, only to have it reoccur outside Mauritius.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I agree with that 100%, no pilot in South African Airways, and no pilot having had a fire like that would fly on, that's categoric.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> That's perfectly right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Except that if you were to land in hostile territory, then there would be a problem for that pilot wouldn't it or certainly it would have been a problem for South African authorities?  For instance, you couldn't land in India or Bombay or anywhere else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sir, when you're on fire you land anywhere Sir, believe me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of course there is the proposition that could be made, when you are ordered not to land anywhere but to fly on then you won't land anywhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, not at all.  A Captain is a Captain, he's not ordered, you don't tell Captains what to do.  Captains by the law of the land, will fly the aeroplane and they are in total command.  If he doesn't want to fly that he won't fly it, he is in command.  Nobody tells Captains what to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I want to put to you a version Captain Mitchell, that Captain Uys had a fire, that he had fought the fire and probably got it out, that he had then asked, because the rule and regulations suggest that the moment you've got the fire out you land at the nearest suitable airfield  And I want to suggest that he radioed in for permission to do that and he was asked - listen to the proposition ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm listening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Before you prejudge it.  He asked ZUR permission to land and landing under those conditions would invoke a search of his cargo and a full inquiry and SAA could not afford to have it's hold searched when it was carrying military contraband and that is the reason that Uys flew on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sir, that's a reasonable proposition and I accept it as one of the possibilities but at the same time I know, I knew South African Airways pilots.  One, if you have a fire you are going to go and land, sorry, you are going to go and land, that's it, you ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I don't want to interrupt you but I'm going to.  There are so many incidents of people having various types of fires and not doing that, that it makes a mockery of your statement, that's number one.  Number two, we are suggesting to you that there was a serious fire aboard that aircraft and that Uys did not land, and the one interpretation that you can put on the meal on the tape recorder, you are incredibly reluctant to accept.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> 100% I do not accept, I really do not accept this one.  There was no fire, the fire came later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> How do you know that Captain Mitchell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> They would have landed Doctor, they would have landed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> They would have landed unless ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> With a fire of that kind of quality.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> They would have landed unless they had thought they had it out and had been ordered to go on.  What do you think the results would have been if Bombay officials had searched the hold of that aircraft and found military ordinance aboard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> You'd probably go to jail with the Captain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And what else do you think would have happened?   What do you think would have happened to</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a>SAA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Well, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> This country stank in the eyes of the world, to ...[indistinct] a metaphor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I was only thinking of the Captain, please not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I was only talking about, thinking about the Captain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I'm talking about SAA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> There would have been problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> What sort of problems Captain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm not a politician.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> But do you not think that it is highly likely that civilised countries would have said: "Who are these fools carrying military ordinance over our countries in civilian aircraft?</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sir, again I am not part of that process, I am not a politician, I am a pilot, I don't get involved in these kinds of issued, it's not my interest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well I'm assuming you're a man or ordinary intelligence or possibly above ordinary intelligence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Captain Mitchell, what do you think would have happened to the passengers who learnt that they are about to enter, overseas passengers or for that matter any passengers because it would have been world news, do you think that passengers would have been queuing up to fly aboard SAA aircrafts that were carrying rocket fuel all over the place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't know ...[indistinct] rocket fuel or anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Just answer the question please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> The passengers would have definitely been most unhappy with SAA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I want to put it to you Captain Mitchell, that had that information come out, it would have sunk SAA deeper than the Helderberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Probably, probably, but let's get back to the first one please doctor.  That Captain, no Captain will fly with that kind of fire, no Captain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> He thought he had it out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sorry Sir, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> He thought he had it out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sorry, I'm emphatic about that.  Furthermore, if there was any kind of fire - look you're quite right about a cushion catching light and they put it out with a fire extinguisher and they sit with it, if there was a fire on board that aeroplane earlier in the day, which you are suggesting, I can guarantee you that any Captain would - you'd have a man sitting there until you landed at that emergency place.  I mean, you must be stupid to fly, I mean you're putting your neck on the line.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a> That doesn't work like that doctor, it really doesn't.  Please accept my word.  I am a pilot, I've got lots of experience, I know what pilots think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And you have, despite your experience, you have a deep dark secret to cover up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No Sir, I can give you my word, really I  haven't.  Stupid I may be but I'm not covering anything up, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You have every reason to cover up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Because you were at the centre of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Oh no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You have every reason to prevaricate and to lie about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm not lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Whereas the people who have made these statements have no reason whatsoever to lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You have not given us one adequate explanation for any of the things that I've put to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I've disagreed with you on them, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Of course you have but you haven't given one adequate explanation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I'm sorry, I've told you about the HF which is a very, very valid process and I hope you take not of it because your whole case falls apart when you look at that.  Secondly, when you look at the eating process of which men eat in the aeroplanes, that certainly is a most logical process and I can give you evidence on many Captains like that Sir, many.   Furthermore, the process of a Captain and a fire, Captains will land doctor, Captains will land, they will not fly.  When you've got a fire and your necks is at stake, believe me there is one thing that we taught our Captains and that is why they are Captains, they will land.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Why didn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Because he got the fire much later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> One last question Captain Mitchell, the cockpit voice recorder records the last half hour in the aircraft, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> The last conversation immediately before that aircraft plunged into the sea some 130 odd nautical miles outside Mauritius was a conversation with Plaissance Airport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It started with: "This is Springbok 295, we have a smoke problem".</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Have you heard that tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> That was the last half hour's conversation aboard that aircraft was it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Recorded, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Correct.  Can you give me - and that was a smoke problem, Captain Uys said: "We have a smoke problem", not: "We have a fire problem or anything else: "We have a smoke problem", okay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And you pilots are taught to be accurate in your communications, so if he had a smoke problem he had a smoke problem.  Can you give one - have you read the tape recording transcript of the CVR?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Is there one word of that conversation on that CVR?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Is there one word?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Is there one word of the Plaissance conversation on the cockpit voice recorder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Is any of the conversation between Uys and Plaissance present on the cockpit voice recorder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Show me where please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Didn't it say land runway 14 ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Show me where the conversation on the CVR corresponds in any way with the Plaissance tape recording, which is a good quality tape recording.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Isn't it there they say runway 14 at Plaissance ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Don't say: "Isn't it".  Are you telling me that there is an overlap, that the words spoken by Uys on the cockpit voice recorder are mirrored in the conversation with Plaissance, and if you are telling me that I am going to invite you to show me, I have both conversations here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sorry, can I give to you what I understand  you're asking me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> They were coming in to land and Dawie Uys says: "Plaissance, Springbok 294"</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> "We started the descent on the way down.  We're down to 140.  We've got smoke problems", that's the tape I'm talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> And then Plaissance comes back and says: "What is your height, what are you doing" ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Then he says: "Cleared under 5000 feet ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> And he says: "Runway 32 and 14" and he, that's the tape ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Your memory is astounding, it is good and it is accurate.</p>

<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And I'm not being sarcastic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, I've got the ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.  Show me one word of that conversation on the cockpit voice recorder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> But isn't that the cockpit voice recorder tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, it isn't, it is the tape taken from the airport control tower at Plaissance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Well there you are, I didn't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well now you do, now show me one word of that conversation of the last half hour of that aircraft ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I get your point, I get your point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Can you explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I will explain it to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> That the cockpit voice recorder ceased functioning before that last half hour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> That's feasible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Now, in the light of that your denials are even more hollow about the fact that that cockpit voice recorder ceased functioning earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I've haven't denied it and I'm not anti what you're saying, so I ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, you could have fooled me Captain Mitchell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No I'm not, they're not hollow, I'm just trying to ...[indistinct] together there so that we can link this together, that the cockpit voice recorder as well as the Plaissance tape don't match and so forth.  So you're saying that it could have been further back down there and hence the reason why it wasn't ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I hear you.  I haven't heard that concept before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, for a man who was at the centre of the investigation and a man of your experience ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, no, hang on, I'm not at the centre of the investigation, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> You were a key figure in the early stages, you lost friends and colleagues aboard that aircraft, you are a professional man and not only that, I happen to know that there are regular briefings about aircraft accidents and this one would have been particularly important, which and pilots undergo and you often present Captain Mitchell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Not really, but that's another thought.  I haven't thought down that line, so I take note of what  you're saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.  And I want to put it to you that the reason the Jimmy Mittens report never got before Margo is that he and the rest of his crew were intimidated because you've conceded to this Commission that his interpretation was a reasonable interpretation.  You disagree with it but it an interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> And furthermore, that in some inexplicable way you were summoned by Margo to his house in the middle of the night at the same time as the flight engineers ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, no, no, I didn't say the middle, that's dramatic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Some time at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, it was daytime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, that's important.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, it's not important.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> The fact is ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> We must report accurately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, let's record it accurately.  You were summoned to Margo's house outside the proper sitting of the hearing, together with the flight engineers, which corresponds with what they have told us despite the fact that you deny everything else that they have told us.  And incidentally that version had to be wrung out of you with some difficulty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sorry, I've got a bad memory but I was as helpful as I can be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well, Captain Mitchell, a lot of the help that you've given us, I must tell you has been inadvertent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Well, I'm sorry, I would have like to have been more direct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Mr Mitchell, when you were summoned to Justice Margo's house, did you have a personal lawyer or did you have a lawyer for the company, for SAA at that time?  A lawyer who represented the SAA in the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Present with me at that visit Mr Magadla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> No, no, no, not with you but did you have your own personal lawyer at the time, not going there with him, just a lawyer looking after your own affairs, personal affairs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> My personal affairs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Mm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Is that my personal or South African Airways affairs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Both, let's say both.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Alright.  The lawyers of South African Airways were the men from Transnet, the people from Barlow and Clyde in London and Mr Puckrin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Okay.  Now, did you inform at any one of them or did you inform Mr Puckrin that we you were being summoned by Justice Margo to go to this house at night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, it wasn't at night Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Or whatever time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, it sounds dramatic at night but it wasn't ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Well, let's leave the drama, but did you inform them that you had been summoned by Justice Margo to go to his house, which you knew was very irregular, highly irregular for him to have done that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sir with respect, I did not know it was irregular.  It might sound dumb but believe me, I did not know it was irregular.  If a Judge says to me to come to his house, don't argue, I'm going.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> But then knowing that he's investigating that matter and he's presiding on that Commission and that you were a likely witness in that matter, did you not see it fit to inform the lawyer that represented the company SAA, that: "Look, I'm being called by that Judge, I don't know what questions he wants to ask me, I just thought I should let you know or tell me what to say when I get to him"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, I didn't do that because I'm not aware of the legal process.  It's exactly the same as I've come here today, with an open mind and open statement here.  I've got no lawyer with me now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Are you saying you did not know that there was a lawyer looking after the interests of SAA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, I've said there was, the whole system was in place but I was not, I really was not aware that what the Judge, he was interfering with the process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> After you had seen the Judge, did you go to, did you inform the lawyer as to what the Judge had said to you?  I mean, the company was preparing their own version into what happened to the Helderberg, now that's done in conjunction with all the role players, the main role players like yourself.  Now you are being called by a Judge somewhere privately or otherwise and you go there, what about informing these other people, the people who were actually in charge of the interests of the company?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I wonder whether the other people who went to the Judge also informed the company's lawyers of the process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> No, I'm talking about yourself Mr Mitchell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sir, I didn't inform anybody because I didn't think it was relevant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Did you inform them as to what the Judge had said to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Well, I don't know what the Judge said to me Sir, I'm trying to remember what it was about.  I ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> No, at that time.  You forget now, it's a long time now but after you had been to the Judge, did you go to the other members and say to them: "What did he call you for, he called me for this, this is what he said to me"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I get the point ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Or: "Have we been saying the same thing to the Judge or not"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, we didn't compare notes with anybody, I really didn't.  I can't ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Did you tell your family that you had been called by the Judge and he had this to say to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Probably.  If I look at my diary, no, it's 10 years ago, you won't find it.  It will be in my diary that I went there.  Probably I would have told my wife I've been or my secretary, that I would have gone.  I'm sounding particularly dull, I'm very sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Maybe finally just in a nutshell, what did you seek to clarify with the documents that you have before you now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> These ones here Sir?  What I wanted to clarify is that the basis, and I'll try and make it a simple straight sentence without repeating myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a> The purpose of the big discussion on the tapes is based on the fact that there was communication between the aeroplane and ZUR.  Now in the evidence the people who were there before, the Mr Dick and Mr Naude, they stood up for the system and said it's a wonderful radio system and it's in actually fact a very relevant system.  You could to ZUR all the time.  Well, in actual fact they were wrong.  They gave wrong evidence to the Court, they were incorrect.  And the point that I make is right.  Now why I brought that evidence from this last flight and also in addition to this, when Mauritius radio called ZUR 3 times x four frequencies the following day and didn't get them, the point I'm making about it is that HF Communications is not a telephone.  That is the first thing.  The probability we had over six hours no contact a matter of a week ago, and this is just an example because it happens every second night.  It's not every night, it depends on the ...[indistinct] sphere and I've brought documents to give to the Commission to show that the base line of saying that communications did take place Sir, it did not take place.  If they did transmit there it skipped distance over the top, on top of the world, through the ...[indistinct] sphere and there was none there.  Doctor Klatzow is a scientist and I'm very happy to give him all these documents.  I've got documents from Aikaho, from Iata, from Afri Region, the whole lot of them, to show that HF radio is not a good means of communication.  So the simplest assumption that you can say, I spoke to ZUR or was suggested by a lady who came to see me in Mauritius, she said: "You telephoned", I said: "No, Madam it's not a telephone, you're lucky if you get it", so ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Does that seek to confirm that there was nothing on the tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> That seeks to confirm that the probability that there was no transmission between the aeroplane and ZUR.  And then my next link to this is, if that is the case and the man had heard it, he would have written it down but he didn't ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Would that kind of evidence not have helped Justice Margo then in coming to an informed decision in his inquiry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> But he did.  He said there are five pilots on this Commission and he has come to the conclusion that there's no point in going down that particular road, that's exactly what he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> So it was the basis of your evidence or your information that Justice Margo came to the kind of finding that he came to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, Sir.  Mr Germishuys, Mr Thomkins, all the other people were pilots there.  I was not part of the discussion with anything with the Commission or the Judge.  I only went there once Sir, for this meeting and then I was a witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> But if you were so clear in your mind about helping Justice Margo, how is it that you have this kind of difficulty about informing about the tape that had been taped over or producing that tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It was so irrelevant Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Irrelevant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, yes.  If I know that there was no communication and my man didn't write anything then, I know what radios can do and I know what radios can't do and they didn't call.  So if it didn't come through them, I just disregarded it, it was very low priority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> But hearing that, I think it has been said quite often here that he was furious about this issue of the tape and you were there then to say: "Judge it is relevant because I know there was nothing on that tape"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It was said Mr Commissioner, it was said.  It was said that what was written down was on, Mr Nadel handled all of that.  I didn't handle any of the ZUR processes, the other four people, I think it's four, spoke to Judge Margo and handled the whole process.  At the end of it he said: "That's enough of that".</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a> So, I don't run ZUR, they were one of the many things that were there but I certainly didn't run ZUR and hence the reason, when I knew there was nothing on the tape and nothing on the sheet, it's a very low priority process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> But finally, there has been talk of a delay in this plane taking off from Taipei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Now what about that delay, what was the</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a>reason and how was it explained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Was there no delay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Are you hearing it for the first time now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> At the back of my mind I think there was a delay.  There was a 20 minute or, there was an incoming aeroplane for moving cargo or something.  An incoming aeroplane had ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Was that on the ZUR?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, no, no, I read that there was an incoming aeroplane and there was cargo to be transferred from A to B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> Cargo to be transferred from A to B?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAGADLA:</span> What sort of cargo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't know.  Pilots don't know what's the cargo and that is quite important too.  A pilot doesn't know what the cargo is, he merely signs the load sheet and that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MS TERREBLANCHE:</span> Excuse me to interrupt, I would just like to know if there is anything to be photocopied to save time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I've brought the photocopies with me, so I've got a double to give to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MS TERREBLANCHE:</span> Wonderful, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> It's very important what I tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MS TERREBLANCHE:</span> I would just like to ask one question quickly, you were quoted very recently in the Saturday Star of 23rd of May 1998 and in it you are to have said:  "The truth about the event leading to the Helderberg crash will probably exceed even the wildest fantasies of any ...[indistinct] fiction writer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Commissioner ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Could I answer that for you, because the quote emanates from a reporter who listened to the conversation which I had with you and misquoted you and the quote about that is incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sir, you're on my side for once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> No, I'm on your side all the time Captain Mitchell, when you're on the side of truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Ja.  Commissioner I brought this in to say the first thing that I want to take about, is that, I got this on Saturday morning when I got to South Africa and clearly, I don't have to go any further, that's wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> That particular quote is wrong.  What you did say to me when I put these versions to you at the original tape recorded conversations I had with you, was that: "You could believe these stories about the tape recordings and what have you if you believed or if you read James Hadley Chase".  That is what you said, quote.  And that was taken out of context and misquoted to give the quote which is in the paper, which I must apologise for although it was not my fault.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Where did she get the tapes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> What tapes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> The ones, how did she manage to get that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Because I played it to her in my study.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Really?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Oh dear me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Not: "dear me".</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Dear me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MS WILDSCHUT:</span> Okay, are there any more questions that you'd like to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Just one last question Madam Commissioner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MS TERREBLANCHE:</span> Yes, Doctor Klatzow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It must have been very - you must have been very curious as to what happened to the Helderberg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I think the company went such a way to find this out there, it's one of the reasons that amaze me.  I'm not part of intrigue and politics or anything like that at all but why when aeroplanes crash and people get killed, that's my line, I'm a pilot.   We went to incredible depths, four kilometres to pull this out there and we did it.  The purpose of that was to find out why the aeroplane crashed.  We fought with Boeing, we fought with Rene van Zyl to find out why the aeroplane went and we worked together on the process and to this day we still don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Did you in that process of your insatiable curiosity ever bother to listen to the ZUR tape or did you simply accept the assurance that it was irrelevant because nobody had written anything in the log?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Sir, you might call me dumb but I just accepted it on face value that there was nothing there, so you probably think me dumb, I ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> I just want to tell you one last thing, do you know a man called du Toit, Captain Charl du Toit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> He told Rene van Zyl a different version, so we've got enough versions here to really make a Hobson's choice.   He told Rene van Zyl that he'd listened to the tape and there was nothing on it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Did he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> Well I'm telling you that's what he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> I don't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> So we have a whole series of versions about what happened to this tape but the one thing is certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It disappeared shortly after leaving your hands, never to reappear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Really?  I don't see it like that.  It went to DCA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLATZOW:</span> It didn't go to DCA Captain Mitchell, we've been through that ad nauseam but thank you for your participation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MS WILDSCHUT:</span> Captain Mitchell, it remains for me to thank you too.  It's probably been a harrowing day for you.  We would like to conclude if no-one else has anymore questions.  Thank you very much for coming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Thank you.  I'm sorry ...[inaudible] I'm sorry that I seem to have got tongue tied and got things crossed over.  My pure intent is to get the exact truth right over to you because I am as keen as everybody if this inquiry comes open I'm the first to be in line to assist you.  So, thank you and I hope it was helpful.  I hope you can make use of this important statement that I made on the baseline of your assumption that the ZUR tapes had something because this is ...[indistinct]</p>

<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MS TERREBLANCHE:</span> We'd just like to suggest that before Mr Mitchell goes - I'm also tired, that he just hands over the evidence to the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MS WILDSCHUT:</span> Is that in order Mr Mitchell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> No, certainly.  With your permission, may I show Doctor Klatzow the process that I've gone through so that he can see my logic that I've put in there or is that not in order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MS WILDSCHUT:</span> Well that will be done off the record then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR MITCHELL:</span> Yes, okay.  It's just so that he sees the logics, the way I put it in, so when he phones me again on tape then I can tell him what I'm talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MS WILDSCHUT:</span> We just want to put it on the record that it is the Commission's file.</p>
