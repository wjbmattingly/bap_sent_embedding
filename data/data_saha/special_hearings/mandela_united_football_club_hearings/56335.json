The postamble, Mr Cachalia, reads that the Constitution provides a historic bridge between the past of a deeply divided society characterised by strife, conflict, untold suffering and injustice, and a future founded on the recognition of human rights, democracy and peaceful co-existence and development opportunities for all South Africans, irrespective of colour, race, class, belief or sex.\n The pursuit of national unity, the well-being of all South African citizens and peace require reconciliation between the people of South Africa and the reconstruction of society.  The adoption of this Constitution lays the secure foundation for the people of South Africa to transcend the divisions and strife of the past, who has generated gross violations of human rights, the transgression of humanitarian principle in violent conflicts and a legacy of hatred, fear, guilt and revenge.\n This can now be addressed on the basis that there is a need for understanding, but not for vengeance.  A need for reparation, but not for retaliation.  A need for ubuntu but not for victimisation.  In order to advance such reconciliation and reconstruction, amnesty shall be granted in respect of acts, omissions and offences associated with political objectives and committed in the course of the conflicts of the past.\n To this end, Parliament under this Constitution, shall adopt a law determining a firm cut off date, which shall be a date after 8 October 1990 and before 6 December 1993.  Of course, there were amendments to this and provided for the mechanisms, criteria and procedures, including tribunals if any, through which such amnesty shall be dealt with at any time after the law has been passed.\n Would you accept I have read the postamble the way it stands, Mr Cachalia?",

So there were certain lines that had to be bled for obvious reasons from the point of view of security.  Now only to the extent that you wanted certain things to be done, you could only ask and enquire so much.  In fact there was a term in those days that said, ask no questions and be told no lies.\n But it basically had to do with the fact that you only needed to know what was relevant  for what you had to do, especially where you begin to engage the elements of the struggle.  That had to be secured from obvious in fact interest from the Security Police.\n Now, those things obviously do create significant tension in terms of the ways in which people want to relate to one another, how do you go, if you know that there are people in Mrs Mandela's place, you know, either those people are people who belong to your former structures, or people who probably come from the underground, and you wouldn't want to go and interfere in that kind of thing, because you have obvious fears that you might end up getting caught in things that don't really have to do with what you want to achieve.\n So those things create those tensions and those fears that people tend to have about how far to make certain enquiries.  That is the environment we are functioning in, so to the extent that Mrs Mandela was not necessarily a part of the structures, the official structures are the elected, in our definition of the mass democratic movement, it was a broad definition, because at the core of it, were the organised formation's attempts of the UDF and Cosatu, but it was defined broad enough so that as a movement you actually tried to pull people in behind a particular common objective.\n Now, in that situation, you have seen a river in torrent, it drags along everything along with it, you know.  And you've got no way of clearly defining exactly who everyone is who are coming into the stream, so we hoped to be able to clarify that by the time it get to the leadership point of view.\n So depending on how far you were, people tended to take certain actions as well, that would not necessarily accord with the core and heart of what the movement stands for.  So those things do happen and I think that the statement relating to boxes of matches and petrol bombs etc, is one case in point, where I think the movement had expressed an opinion that it doesn't accord with our sentiment of how we want a justice struggle,  particularly from a leadership point of view.",

We have just had the pronouncement and confirmation of Stompie Seipei as being in fact the person whose body was discovered, now the tension has begun.\n At that time also my recollection is that even the Crisis Committee had begun to throw its arms up in the air, in despair at not being able to resolve this issue because of the reports surrounding even the Football Club, because the youth congresses, they were saying they were sick and tired now of this thing and they are going to engage with the Football Club and for us, we had to make a very quick decision how we go about resolving this issue.\n On that evening, the evening of the 15th, there was actually a meeting at Ipeleheng in (indistinct), where this issue was discussed, where people had come together to say, I think the 15th was the day after the Stompie body confirmation.\n Now, we then had to make a decision because I mean, as I say that we had all the role leadership responsibility, assessing the situation and the mood, and the one thing we couldn't afford at that time, was to have a situation where amongst our own people, or people who have believed that they are in the same movement, to end up in conflict, precisely because one of the things people were saying was what is the leadership doing, why can't it do something about its problems?\n You know, we needed some direction, what is going to happen?  Now, the question is what do you do at that point in time, because our assessment then was that having isolated the (indistinct) at least as we perceived it then, has been around Mrs Mandela, having got hold of the reports from the Crisis Committee, etc, and for us in fact at that time, taking a look at it politically, it was clear I mean if one looks at all, I mean in our statement, nowhere does it suggest that Mrs Mandela, did this to Stompie or did that.\n We actually talk about complicity.  Now it was difficult for us to cast any direct evidence.  Now, you would tell me if in all of these events that were happening, around her homestead, you would need to have been, even Rip van Winkel I think, would have woken up.  \n Now, the point for me is that we took the decision because we felt there was a sense in which someone in a responsible position, could have done something and for us then, it was an incisive and decisive decision.  It had a shock element in it as well, because of the person involved and I think that it was also meant to convey a message down stream, that at least our movement can take its position on these matters, even if the person involved is in fact of a senior disposition.",

The fear that the community began to have of this group, was actually akin to the feat that any other community in other parts of the country had fears of vigilante whether they were the Witdoeke or the Ama Africa.",

I can assure you of course that speaking from this panel, we haven't got a mandate to further anyone's political agenda.  But we can't ignore those sort of perceptions.\n And I can tell you that in the course of our having been asked by the ANC and by the President, to investigate the existence or otherwise of spies within the ANC, some of the submissions that we have got, seemed to suggest that there is within the ANC powerful condemning forces and these condemning forces are struggling for dominance.\n They were identified in opinion form, on the one hand as Africanists, on the other the white liberal cabal, the Indian cabal.  Now, you will appreciate why against that background, it becomes important for us, when you are under oath, and especially in view of the sort of call that you have made, that people who have a record of the nature that you have identified, should not hold public office.\n Now, to the extent that Mrs Mandela is identified for instance, to be in the Africanist group and to the extent that you might be identified to be part of the so-called Indier cabal(?), I think what is very, very important for us, would be to get a comment from you because I can almost see that there would be in furtherance of those submissions that we have, a view that says the real reason that you made that call, and that in fact you came to testify, is because you are furthering the agenda of the so-called Indier cabal for dominance within the ANC and that the TRC hearings, and this particular one, are being used by you to carry out that agenda, that is a perception.\n So I would like you to let us have the benefit of your comments because the call you have made is one we cannot ignore, because it has been made incidentally in various Commissions, by the ANC which have been annexed to their submissions to us.",

The one is from the evidence of the witnesses that have testified here and both of you could choose to answer, it is quite clear that the Club's activities were taking place over a period of time, but there seems to be two turning points in the whole saga.\n The first is the burning of the Mandela house by the Daliwonga students, and of course the second is the abduction of the boys and of course the subsequent killing of Stompie.  Now the recurring theme which runs through the statements that were issued over that time, is that Mrs Mandela should be brought into the structures and brought closer.\n Now, my two questions are why did it take so long for any kind of action to take place, second is why could she not be brought into the structures and disciplined, she was part of some structure, even if it was loose?",

Now it is a mood point as to whether was that the appropriate point, at that point or should it have been done earlier.\n Perhaps if you look at it, and if you have to criticise ourselves, we could then say that perhaps they should have been done earlier, it should have worked well for the benefit for the individual in question and also for the movement, for the people as a whole, so it is difficult to say whether that was the right moment or the wrong moment to have done what we did.",

I would image that the Commission would then need to weigh that against the balance of probability in terms of the relationship between what they say and in fact the adverse aspects of the fact, their acts could well have been just mere criminal etc.\n The question is where is that link, how do you draw that list?

I have no direct or personal knowledge regarding the formation and purpose of the Mandela United Football Club.\n In respect of the investigation into the death of Dr Abu-Baker Asvat, and the Lolo Sono and Sibosiso Shabalala cases, I have been approached on various occasions by Mr Tony Leon, MP to investigate certain specific matters.\n I have also been visited in my capacity as National Commissioner, by the parents of Lolo Sono who were of the firm view that the police have not sufficiently followed up on all possible clues to trace their missing son or to prove their suspicion that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was responsible for this death.\n I view the representations in a very serious light and instructed the command structure of the detective branch to reconsider the cases in lieu and follow up on every alleged loose end and to take all additional allegations into consideration in conjunction with the relevant Attorney General.\n All information received by me was personally channelled to the investigation officers in question and feedback was provided to Mr Tony Leon.  Copies of the relevant correspondence between myself and Deputy National Commissioner, Mike Bester, with Mr Leon, are available.\n In essence the following information is contained in these replies to Mr Leon, namely firstly Ms Emma Nicholson, the British member of Parliament and Mr Katiza Cebekhulu were on various occasions during July 1995, interviewed in London by Superintendent H.T. Moodley.\n Mr Cebekhulu had to such date, given four versions regarding the death of Dr Abu-Baker Asvat, it was evident that Mr Cebekhulu is not a reliable witness and for this reason could not be used as a witness in a criminal trial.\n Superintendent Moodley was of the opinion that Mr Cebekhulu's knowledge of the death of Dr Abu-Baker Asvat is from conversations between himself and Messrs Dlamini and Mbata, the two persons convicted and sentenced for the death of Dr Abu-baker Asvat, whilst they were detained at the police cells in Lenasia and Protea Soweto.\n No new evidence could be found implicating Mrs Madikizela-Mandela in the murder of Dr Abu-Baker Asvat.  The Deputy Attorney General of the Witwatersrand, local division, was of the opinion that there is insufficient evidence for a successful prosecution of Mrs Madikizela-Mandela, as she on the strength of the available evidence, cannot be connected with the crime.  The Attorney General indicated that he decided not to prepare any application for the extradition of Mr Cebekhulu.\n The case docket of Mr Sono was submitted to the Attorney General, who declined to prosecute Mrs Madikizela-Mandela and members of the Mandela United Football Club as the body of Mr Sono had not been found.  The Attorney General indicated that the discovery of the body is necessary to institute criminal proceedings.  A possible site where Mr Sono had allegedly been buried was pointed out to the South African Police Service, the site was thoroughly searched twice aided by excavators and police dogs but to no avail.\n Following the statement attributed to Mrs Madikizela-Mandela in the Citizen of 19 September 1996, namely that certain women had told the TRC that their missing children had last been seen in the company of Mrs Madikizela-Mandela and that the TRC had received evidence from the askari who had killed these children and had not called on him to speak in public, Mr Leon was informed that the TRC by means of Mr Patrick Kelly, the Regional Manager Johannesburg responded on 8 November 1996 as follows and I quote:\n\"I have consulted our investigative unit on the matter.  Two cases relating to Winnie Mandela were heard at the Commission's Human Rights Violations hearings in Soweto on 22 July 1996, these cases were of the disappearance of Lolo Sono and Sibuniso Shabalala.  I can find nothing to support the assertion that the TRC has evidence from an askari relating to either of these cases\".\n Results of any further investigations or facts gained were dealt with according to normal procedures including submission to the Attorney General.  In a letter dated 13 October 1995, addressed to the Minister of Safety and Security, Advocate K M Attwell, the then acting Attorney General of the Witwatersrand Division, informed regarding the further investigation concerning Dr Abu-Baker Asvat's murder that there was at that stage, and I quote, \n\"Quite simply insufficient evidence for a successful prosecution of Mrs W Mandela.  On the strength of the available evidence she cannot be connected with the crime\".\n It has been brought to my attention, Mr Chairman, that according to media reports on 24 October 1997 Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has alleged before this Commission that the President of South Africa, President Nelson Mandela, had instructed me as National Commissioner of the South African Police Service to, and I quote -\n\"Dig up dirt\".\non Mrs Madikizela-Mandela with a view to their divorce proceedings.  This allegation is simply a bare-faced lie and I am duty bound to flatly reject it.  These allegations are an insult not only to President Mandela but also to the South African Police Service. \n Sir the South African Police Service is not an instrument of politicians to settle personal scores and I find it offensive in the extreme that anyone could even suggest that President Mandela would go to such lengths on a personal matter.\n Mr Chairman that is my statement, the original copy is in my possession and I can hand it in as an exhibit.",

I just wanted to say that in the investigation diary under the 12th of May 1995 - an entry by Colonel Hesslinger, there's an indication that he spoke to - well, he says, spoke to a Lieutenant Muller MID Soweto, who confirmed that Richardson was an informer.\n The documents and registers were in headquarters, Section K, a Brigadier Steyn and that Brigadier Steyn referred Superintendent Hesslinger to a Lieutenant Colonel Shaw.  The point I'm getting at is that it would appear that there are documentation sitting somewhere in Pretoria about informers and I'm wondering if that is the case, if you are able to establish - with documentation, that Gerry Richardson had been informer, that there would be a whole host of other documents sitting there which would indicate to the Commission who were informers.

We heard yesterday and today that perhaps there was third force activity going on at the time when the Mandela United Football Club was functioning, we've also heard about Operation Romulous to discredit Mrs Mandela.  What I'm trying to understand is that - and you yourself said when asked by Mr PIGOU about other informers, that you'd looked into it and you haven't been able to find other files but it does - I find it interesting that we find information concerning Mrs Mandela and that there's an informer suddenly that comes up, is it possible then for us to construe that perhaps there's still a third force functioning within the police force?\n I take your point that you have the greatest faith in your investigators because it's been mentioned at other times particularly in regard to what's happening in KwaZulu Natal - the term third force has been used even by our President, now is that possible.  Let me just make one more point, we've had communication with the police services throughout the country in terms of the period we're looking at and yes, we've had co-operation but often when information is asked for, we have been told that either the information has been destroyed or there's not information.  \n I just find it very interesting that suddenly we have this information coming up at a time when not only the Mbatha and Dlamini's are being questioned again but also the issue of Mrs Mandela is coming up to, perhaps you could comment on that.",

I'm not saying that we don't have people who are not willing to participate, I'm not that naive.  \n I think we still have a lot of people who are not willing to participate in the process but that's a different issue.
