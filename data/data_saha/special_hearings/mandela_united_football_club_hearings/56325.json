            "....hearing is that before the Commission can make any findings it has to try and get as much information as possible and get the views of everybody concerned before that time.\n We will be hearing a number of witnesses today and tomorrow.  It will be a very full programme.  I will be very grateful for the cooperation of the witnesses, of the legal representatives and those who are attending the hearing so that we can work expeditiously.  I want to remind you that this is not a court of law, nevertheless the same standards of decorum and dignity which are normally observed in a court of law we expect to be observed here. \n We will do everything we can to give everyone a fair hearing and at the end of the two days we will re-examine our findings in the light of the hearing which started last year before drawing our own conclusions which will be made available in our report to President Mandela, at the end of the work of the Commission.\n I would like to introduce the panel to you.  On my far left is Dr Xhoso Mgojo who is the convenor now of the Kwa-Zulu Natal district or province where one of our offices is based.  He is also a member of the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee and he is a Commissioner.\n Immediately on left is Yasmin Sooka who is a Commissioner, who is Deputy Chairperson of the Human Rights Violations Committee and is based in Johannesburg.\n On my far right is Dr Fazel Randera who is the convenor and in charge of the Johannesburg office of the TRC.  He is a Commissioner, and is obviously based in Johannesburg.\n Next to him is Miss Hlengiwe Mkhize who is Chairperson of the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee, a Commissioner and is based in Johannesburg.\n Immediately next to me is Dumisa Ntsebeza, a Commissioner based in Cape Town but also head of our Investigative Unit.\n My name is Alec Boraine.  I am the Deputy Chairperson of the Commission and it is my job to ensure that these hearings are conducted fairly and efficiently.\n I would like to extend a very special welcome to legal representatives and for the record I would be grateful if you could indicate, starting on my right, as to who you are representing and then we will proceed.",

            "\"I, the undersigned Andre Kritzinger\n declares hereby under oath as follows:\n I am a Superintendent in the South African Police Service.  The contents of this statement falls within my personal knowledge unless stated otherwise and to the best of my knowledge is true and correct.\nBACKGROUND:   On 9 January 1975 I entered the South African Police Service and since then have been in the service of that organisation.  I was advised not to load this statement by giving too many details regarding the course of my career.  I will limit myself to the years involved.\n In the period 3 September 1984 - to 16 April 1994 I was part of the Security Branch in Soweto.  During this period as a member of the investigating team known as the Terrorist Tracing Unit I was a component head and my function was investigating of security matters.  \n During my period at the Security Branch, Soweto, my rank was initially that of lieutenant and on 1 July 1989 I was promoted to the rank of Captain, the rank I had when I left the Security Branch in Soweto.\n I am now dealing with the matters mentioned in my subpoena.  The questioning and following death of Sizwe Sithole.  Although I know the name of Sizwe Sithole, I am aware of the fact that there was such a person I had no personal knowledge of the questioning and following death of Sizwe Sithole; the use and handling of informants, and sources associated with the Mandela Football Club and Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.\n Although during my career as detective I did on occasion use informants during the period that I worked at the Security Branch in Soweto I did not make or deal with any informants.  At the Security Branch in Soweto there was a very specific function and one of our functions was not dealing with informants.  I do happen to have knowledge of the fact that there were members of the Security Branch who did deal with informants and had the specific task of doing that.  However, I did not ever hear, nor was I aware at any stage of any sources which were specifically recruited or dealt with, with regards to the Mandela Football Club and Mrs Madikizela-Mandela.\n The abduction, assault and murder of Stompie Seipei in 1988 and information thereabouts, at no stage did I have anything physically to do with the Stompie Seipei matter.  \n On occasions the investigating officers did enquire as to whether I had any knowledge about Mrs Madikizela-Mandela and the United Football Club.  All the information I had in this regard I shared with the investigating officers that this was just background and no specific information regarding the murder, the relationship between the Security Branch, Murder and Robbery and other units in the South African Police Force with regard to matters dealing with Mrs Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club.\n To the best of my knowledge there was no branch of Stratcom at the Security Branch in Soweto which - regarding cooperation, the cooperation that existed was the normal cooperation and there was no specific action directed at Mrs Madikizela-Mandela or the Mandela United Football Club.  \n I was requested by Colonel Jan Potgieter and assisted him in the compiling of a docket regarding Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's activities.  In order to compile this docket I went to different units of the South African Police to gather information regarding activities.  A complete analysis was made of all information regarding her activities and a complete docket stipulating more than 30 incidents was built up.  The docket was finally handed to the Attorney General, Mr Klaus von Lieires.\n Thereafter I never saw the docket again and to the best of my knowledge it is still with Mr von Lieires at the stage when I was transferred from Security Branch, Soweto.\n The use of Intelligence material and the relationship of Intelligence agencies regarding matters affecting Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club, in this regard I refer to what I have said in the paragraph just before this one and the reply is applicable here as well.  \n The interrogation and death of Petrus Johannes Mabotha I was not involved in the interrogation or the death of Mabotha therefore I cannot give any further information in this regard.  \n Information regarding tapping of telephones regarding Mrs Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club, at no stage was I involved in any tapping of phones or the placing and monitoring of any listening device.  I know that this did take place on Mrs Mandela's phone and I read many of the transcriptions and I read summaries and extracts.  I placed this in the docket.  \n I am also aware of the fact that from time-to-time by members of the security branch made use of taps, but I have no knowledge of any incident where Mrs Mandela or the United Football Club was monitored in such a way.  To my knowledge there was no information from such source came under my attention.  \n It was brought to my attention that there are allegations that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was under a 24-hour surveillance.  To the best of my knowledge this is not true.\n The killing of Sergeant Pretorius and two MK members, Leka and Vinyenga in 1988.  I was not physically involved in the planning or execution of the action during which Sergeant Pretorius was killed. As a result I cannot provide any information about the facts regarding this matter.   I knew Sergeant Pretorius and I am aware of the fact that he was a person who worked with informers.  In my opinion he was a dedicated worker and had a good name among his colleagues.  His death was a great shock and I attended his funeral\".\n Mr Chairman that concludes my statement  which has been attested to today.",

The one in which a gun was found at the home of Mrs Mandela.  You were also the Investigating Officer on another matter where youth had their chests calved with inscriptions, Viva ANC, and you have knowledge of the fact that that happened at Mrs Mandela's home.\n You also admit in your statement that you read transcripts of the tapes that were made when her telephone was being monitored, so clearly there was a great deal of surveillance placed both over Mrs Mandela and the activities at her home and yet in spite of that, some of the most logical follow up procedures or as a lawyer I would think a logical, the interrogation of Mrs Mandela and her daughter, either taking a statement from her, these things didn't happen.\n Would you agree then that the only two conclusions that one can draw.  One, that either there was just very sloppy Police work, and quite frankly in terms of what we know of the activities of the Security Branch during that time, it clearly cannot be that conclusion, so therefore the only other conclusion that one can actually lead to is that it suited the Security Branch to have Mrs Mandela and her Football Club to continue operating in this fashion.\n Because you did nothing about it.",

The contents of this statement fall within my personal knowledge, unless otherwise stated and are correct and true according to my best knowledge.\n I was from 3 April 1981 up to 31 December 1987 attached to the Security Branch, Soweto.  I was initially attached to another branch in Soweto.  This included inquiries, information etc.  Later I was used for the collection of information gathering and in that component.\n When I reached the Security Branch, I was a Warrant Officer and was promoted to the rank of Captain when I left.  I was advised not to give details of my career, more careers.  I deal with the matters mentioned in the subpoena.\n The interrogation and the death of Sithole.  I believe that the incidents referred to took place in 1990.  I have no knowledge of the interrogation or the death of Sizwe Sithole.\n Use and handling of informers as sources associated with the Mandela United Football Club.  During my time in Soweto I was not involved with any tasks relating to Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela or the Mandela United Football Club.\n Mrs Mandela's premises were on the eastern side of Soweto and did not fall within the area for which I had a primary responsibility.\n I am naturally aware of it, that the Security Branch made use of informers and I myself, made use of informers.  I am not personally involved of any informers which were specifically associated with Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela or the Mandela United Football Club.\n I am aware that information regarding Mrs Mandela was received from time to time from a great number of various sources as it was received about other people as well.\n The kidnapping, assault and murder of Stompie Seipei in 1988.  In the stage that these things took place, I was no longer attached to the Security Branch Soweto and I have no personal knowledge of these incidents.\n The relation between the Safety Branch, Murder and Robbery, STRATCOM divisions and other Units in the South African Police with regard to matters relating to Mrs Mandela and the Football Club.  During the time that I was working at Soweto Security Branch, there was no STRATCOM component at Soweto.\n My Unit operated covertly and in that regard, did not co-operate in the same way with other Units of the South African Police Services.   Any liaison which did take place, would only have happened at a very senior post level.  To the best of my knowledge, the whole STRATCOM idea only found its basis in 1989 on a national level, that is.\n The use of intelligence material and the relationship with the Intelligence Agencies with regard to matters regarding Mrs Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club.\n I have no knowledge of any such material and I am not aware of any position I think, with regard to Mrs Winnie Mandela and the Football Club.\n The interrogation of Themba Johannes Mabotha.  I am advised that this matter took place during 1989, I have no personal knowledge of the interrogation or the death of Themba Johannes Mabotha.\n Information with regard to observations or monitoring including telephone tapping, bugging, etc in connection with matters relating to Mrs Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club.  I know that tapping of Mrs Mandela's telephone conversations took place at her home.  However, I never went to her home, never was there.  As far as I know, also there was never at any stage permanent monitoring of Mrs Mandela or her Football Club.\n The killing of Pretorius and two MK members, Maleleke and Mbenenge.  These also took place once I had already left Soweto and I have no personal knowledge thereof.",

The contents of this statement falls within my personal knowledge, unless otherwise stated and is to the best of my knowledge true and correct.\nOn the 29th of March 1965 I entered the service of the South African Police.  I became a member of the Security Branch of the SAP in 1971 and remained a member of that Unit until my retirement on 31 January 1995.\nOn 12 December 1984, I was transferred to the Security Branch Soweto where I served until 29 December 1988.  With my transfer to Soweto I had the rank of Captain and during my transfer I was, I had the rank of Major.\n I was advised that it was not necessary to give any further details regarding my career in the South African Police.\n At the Security Branch Soweto I was at the outset part of the information gathering component which became known as the Intelligence Unit as group head and at the stage when I was transferred from Soweto, I was the head of that Unit.\n I am dealing with matters mentioned in my subpoena.  The questioning and following death of Sizwe Sithole.  I have no personal knowledge of this matter.  I have been advised that the events regarding Sizwe Sithole took place in 1991 after I already left the Security Branch Soweto and was transferred to Cape Town.\n The use and handling of informants, sources associated with the Mandela Football Club and Winnie Mandela.  During the period that I was associated with the Security Branch Soweto I only have knowledge of one source which was specifically associated with Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club.  The existence of this source only came to my attention shortly before my transfer from Soweto, resulting from the death of Sergeant Fanie Pretorius.\n The Security Branch continually used informers and sources and during the years various informers and sources gave information regarding Mrs Mandela.  I cannot remember specifically that there was information during the time that I was there, with regard to the Mandela United Football Club.\n The abduction, assault and murder of Stompie Seipei in 1988 and information regarding that.  The whole Stompie Seipei ended after I had already left Soweto in December 1988 and I have no knowledge of these events.\n Relationship between the Security Branch, Murder and Robbery, STRATCOM divisions and other units in the South African Police with regard to matters affecting Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club.\n There was good co-operation between the Security Branch of the South African Police and other Units of the SAP such as Murder and Robbery.  Information was exchanged continually between the different Units, but I have no personal knowledge of any specific co-operation regarding to the activities of Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club.\n I was informed that there are allegations before this Commission that I was in control of the STRATCOM unit at the Security Branch Soweto.   I deny this allegation.\n To the best of my knowledge there have existed no STRATCOM unit outside Head Office in Johannesburg during 1988.  After my transfer to the Cape Province, it was part of my duties to create a STRATCOM unit.  I was not aware of any specific STRATCOM action aimed at Mrs Mandela or the Football Club during the time that I worked at the Security Branch, Soweto.\n It is however, possible that there was STRATCOM actions on instruction from Head Office or Security Branch Witwatersrand which were carried out during this time, but I cannot specifically remember that any of them were directed at Mrs Mandela or the Football Club.\n I knew Paul Erasmus well and exchanged information with him on a continual basis when I came into Johannesburg.  Because of the nature of my activities I came in Johannesburg often.\n I also knew Vic McPherson.  I want to point out that both Erasmus and McPherson testified that I was the head of the STRATCOM unit at the Security Branch Soweto, that is not correct, and I also want to point out that both of them testified that this took place in 1990.\n At that stage I had already left the Security Branch Soweto. \n The use of Intelligence material and the relationship with Intelligence agencies with regard to matters regarding Mrs Winnie Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club.\n In this regard I want to refer to what I have already testified in the paragraph preceding this one.\n The questioning or interrogation and death of Themba Johannes Mabotha.  According to information at my disposal, the detention and death of Mabotha took place in 1989, after I had already left Soweto.\n I have no personal knowledge of this matter.\nInformation including observations, telephone tapping, bugging, etc, regarding matters regarding Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club.\n I am aware of the fact that the tapping of telephone conversations of Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela took place on a continuous basis, I have no knowledge of any bugs which were used.\n The Security Branch Soweto did not have an observation unit that was out, excluding tapping, and it is not possible that they had the ability to observe a person for 24 hours a day.\n I have no knowledge of any permanent observation of Mrs Mandela's house or business or any such observations regarding the Mandela United Football Club.\n The killing of Sergeant Pretorius and two MK members, Maleleke and Mbenenge in 1988.  I was not involved in the planning of execution of the action during which Sergeant Fanie Pretorius was killed, nor do I have any personal knowledge of this matter.  I did know him very well and he was a loved member of the Force, known for the fact that he was a hard worker.\n We were all very shocked by his death.  Thank you.",

As far as surveillance is concerned, I have practical knowledge in the true sense of the word.\n I established a unit of that nature in Cape Town, and to surveil any person for 24 hours, is not an easy task and it was not possible within the Soweto context.\n As far as Paul Erasmus is concerned, yes, I knew him sir.  I think to a certain extent I even facilitated his transfer down to Mossel Bay, myself being in the Cape.  It is a given fact that Paul and I did see one another sometimes because I closely associated myself with Johannesburg Security Branch.\n I had personal friends there.  We were also on the same frequency as far as held hand radio's were concerned, and frequently if something happened in Soweto, one would arrive at a scene and Paul Erasmus would be there.  Particularly one afternoon when Colonel Sauer and Theart were shot, I had hardly gotten to the scene and Paul Erasmus was there, totally outside the ambit of his normal instructions and without how can I put it, as far as Paul in concerned, he might have had less wider and broader tasks and he might have deemed Mrs Mandela and that which went on around her, to be more important in his own task definition than we did in Soweto.\n I am not trying to beat about the bush Mr Chairman, but I can't bring it closer and speak on Paul's behalf, I apologise for that.",

            "I, the undersigned Daniel Francois Malan Bosman, declares under oath as follows:  I am a Lieutenant Colonel and former member of the South African Police.  At present I am a businessman of Bromval Way 19, Hillican Park, Randfontein.   The contents of this statement falls within my personal knowledge, unless otherwise stated and is to the best of my knowledge true and correct.\n During the period 12 December 1983 to 29 February 1996 I was associated with the Security Branch Soweto.  I was associated with the information gathering component and had the rank of Lieutenant when I arrived there and that of Lieutenant Colonel at the stage that I left.  I had been advised that the rest of my career is not relevant in the giving of this evidence.\n Initially I started with the Investigating Unit, but after the need arose later I joined the information gathering component and was tasked with the covert gathering of information with assistance of among others, the tapping of telephone conversations.\n I deal accordingly with the matters mentioned in my subpoena.\n The questioning and following death of Sizwe Sithole.  Apart that this person's name was mentioned in telephone conversations from time to time, I had no knowledge of this person nor do I have any knowledge of his interrogation and following death.\n The use and handling of informers, sources associated with the Mandela Football Club and Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.  The handling of informers, sources was handled by people who were tasked with that.  I was never one of these persons and did not work with any source or informer at any stage.\n Although I was aware of the fact that the Security Branch depended greatly on the information provided by informants or sources and a great deal of trouble was taken to recruit the informers, I am not aware of any specific informer which was directly associated with the Mandela Football Club and Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.\n I am aware of the fact that attempts were made to establish such sources, later I heard that there was one such source which appeared which did provide information to the Security Branch Soweto for a short period.\n The abduction, assault and murder of Stompie Seipei in 1988 and information in regard with that.  The only involvement that I had in this matter was that due to my position, I had insight into the telephone conversation which took place in the house of Mrs Madikizela-Mandela.\n From a variety of these discussions it seemed that there were problems regarding certain young people and that certain people were taken away from the Methodist Church and taken to the house of Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.\n I cannot recall the name Stompie Seipei specifically and cannot remember if the name was specifically mentioned before the raid which was done by the Police at the house of Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.\n Furthermore I can give no details regarding the abduction, assault and murder of Stompie Seipei.\n The relationship between the Security Branch, Murder and Robbery, STRATCOM divisions and other units in the South African Police, with regard to matters affecting Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club.\n There was continual cooperation between the Security Branch and other divisions and units of the South African Police.  As far as I know Soweto Branch of STRATCOM never existed.\n I am aware of the fact that STRATCOM actions were done by the Security Branch Soweto on the orders of the Security Head Office, Pretoria.  At no stage did I personally have any direct contact with a person of STRATCOM Head Office, regarding information about the Mandela Football Club or Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.\n Nor do I have any knowledge that there was any specific action between the various units regarding Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela or the Mandela United Football Club.\n After the Stompie Seipei raid my unit was approached by other units and requested to provide them with any information we had regarding the matter.  I do not know what information was provided as cooperation in this regard took place on the level of the Commanding officers.\n The use of intelligence material and the relationship with intelligence agencies regarding the matters of Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club.\n The distribution of information to intelligence agencies only took place on top levels, but I am aware of the fact that there was interaction between the Security Branch and National Intelligence.\n As far as my knowledge, no information was exchanged with any other agencies.  We also received information from time to time from other intelligence agencies, but as far as I can remember, it had never any direct regard to Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela or the Mandela United Football Club.\n Interrogation and death of Themba Johannes Mabotha.  I have no knowledge of the interrogation and death of Themba Johannes Mabotha.\n Information regarding the observations including telephone tapping, bugging etc, regarding the matters regarding to Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club.\n During the period that I was associated with the Security Branch Soweto, tapping was done on a large scale of Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's telephone conversations.  The contents of the tapes on which these discussions were taped, was routinely transcribed and given to the investigating unit or the administrative component where decisions were then made as to action to be taken.\n The use of bugs did not take place on a large scale, but did take place.  I am of the opinion that at a stage a bug was placed in the house of Mrs Madikizela-Mandela.\n This apparatus was linked to her telephone line so that conversations in her house, could be relayed to tape recorders which taped her discussions.  Information which was achieved or obtained in this way is dealt with on the same way as ordinary tapping, it was transcribed and handed over to the investigating unit or top management or both.\n There was never talk of any 24 hour observation of Mrs Mandela's house or the activities of the Mandela Football Club.  From time to time her house and business was placed under observation, especially during the time that she was restricted.\n We also drove past her house often and often her house was observed.  Any information which was gained, was also passed through to the investigating unit and the administrative component.\n The killing of Sergeant Pretorius and two MK members, Maleleke and Mbenenge in 1988.  I knew Sergeant Fanie Pretorius very well.  He was an extremely hard worker and well loved by his colleagues.  The day that he died, I knew about the operation, but was not part of it.\n I did hear what happened, later.  As a result I can give no personal information regarding the death of Sergeant Pretorius or the two MK members Maleleke and Mbenenge.",
