            "I want to welcome all of you to the hearing.  The Commission team is exactly the same as it was yesterday so I will not introduce them again.\n I would like to say a special word of welcome to a number of families who have lost loved ones from different sides of the conflict.  There are representatives from the Mabotha family here, as well as the Pretorius family.  Mrs Sepei is here, the family of the Sono's, Shabalala's, Asvat's.   Which is a grim reminder of the very high cost that was paid during the years of conflict and nothing should take away from that and I hope that we will bear that in mind and be sensitive to people who have suffered.  \n We have a very tough schedule this morning and I certainly don't want to take away anyone's right to ask questions, to cross-examine, to give testimony.  But I would appeal to the leaders of evidence, to legal representatives and to the witnesses themselves to try and confine ourselves to the heart of the matter.   This is a hearing concerning the so-called Mandela Football Club and Mrs Madikizela Mandela.  If we can keep that in mind I would be most grateful.  From time to time if I think that you are taking too much time I will remind you that we are under pressure.  I am hoping that we can finish at five o'clock and I know that that is \nsupremely optimistic, bearing in mind yesterday.  But let's make a try.  I understand that the lawyers and our leader of evidence, some of them have talked about possible ways of handling huge volumes of evidence and material.  Let's try and do that without stifling debate.  We want to get to as much of the truth as possible.  So thank you again in anticipation.   \n I call the first witness Mr Hume du Toit.  Welcome Mr Du Toit.  Thank you for appearing before the Commission.  My colleague Miss Sooka will administer the oath.",

            "Mr Du Toit, just a very small preliminary announcement to those who are here.  Once again with the heavy television lights and the temperature for those of you who haven't yet taken off your jackets and would like to do so please feel free to get as comfortable as you possibly can so that we can be efficient as possible as well.  Mr Du Toit I am not sure if you were here yesterday but if not let me say that it has become a normal practice to invite witnesses to read their statements into the record and I understand you do have such a statement and I invite you now with the permission of Mr Kemp to read that statement into the record now.\nMR DU TOIT :  \"I the undersigned, Joseph Hume du Toit\n declare as follows under oath.  I am a colonel and a former member of the South African Police.   I am at the moment a businessman of Bendor Street in Tzaneen.  The contents of this statement fall within my personal knowledge unless otherwise mentioned and is to the best of my knowledge true and correct.   I was during the period of 1 December 1988 to 9 February 1990 attached to the security branch Soweto.  I was attached to the tracing and investigation unit and with my arrival at Soweto I had the rank of lieutenant.  On the date upon which I left Soweto I had the rank of captain. I have been advised that the rest of my career is not relevant for this evidence.   I have been a member of the South African Police since the 4th July 1978 until my retirement on 31 May 1996.  I therefore deal with the matters mentioned in my subpoena.                                         The interrogation and subsequent death of Sizwe Sithole.  I don't know who arrested Sizwe Sithole.  He was during this period seeked by everybody for a number of misdemeanours but I was involved with his initial interrogation shortly after the arrest.  As I can remember he was arrested and interrogated for a short period at the Soweto branch before he was transferred to John Vorster Square.  I can't remember any details of the interrogation and didn't have anything to do with him after he went to John Vorster Square.  I know of the fact that he later committed suicide and that there was a commission of enquiry.  I testified before the Commission and I understand that this Commission has a copy of Judge Goldstone's report that he brought out.  In this regard the police have been acquitted of all blame.  Concerning Mrs Madikizela-Mandela.  Information with regard to Mrs Mandela and the football club came from various sources but I don't personally have any knowledge of any informers associated with the football club or Mrs Mandela.   In general the handling of informers was done by persons specially tasked therewith.        The abduction, assault and murder of Stompie Seipei in 1988 and information in relation to this.  This took place before I started working at Soweto.  The case was handled by murder and robbery and not by the security branch and I played no role in it until I was asked to help with the arrest of Johannes Mabotha.  I want to put it clearly that at the time of his arrest he was not related to the Stompie Seipei matter but was arrested because he had deserted as an Askari and because there was a suspicion that he had been involved with certain illegal actions.  After his arrest I found certain documents which are described by this Commission as the Rheingold Furnishers.  I was part of a group of members.  To the best of my memory after we arrested Mr Mabotha we let De Kock know that we had arrested him because he was a person who had deserted from Vlakplaas.  I cannot remember details but I think De Kock joined us later.  I remember that we took Mabotha and handed him to De Kock but I can't remember whether he requested us to take the man to Soweto and detain him there.  I can't remember specifically that I had anything further to do with him.  I was informed that De Kock apparently alleges that Colonel Potgieter gave him the instruction to kill Mabotha.  I don't know anything about such an instruction and it was definitely in my presence no such instruction was given.    The relationship between security and murder and robbery and Mrs Mandela and this football club.  To the best of my knowledge there was not a branch of Stratcom at the security branch.  As concerns co-operation between other units of the SAP and other agencies there was co-operation between them but there was to my knowledge no specific actions directed at Mrs Winnie Mandela or the football club.                                \n The use of intelligence material and the relationship with intelligence agencies with regard to Mrs Mandela and the Mandela United Football club.                                         Although there was continual contact with the various branches of the security forces, including the security branch of the South African Police and national intelligence, I have no personal knowledge of any intelligence material or relationship with the intelligence agencies which had any relationship to Mrs Mandela or the football club.  The interrogation and death of Themba Johannes Mabotha.  I already dealt with this above.         Information with regard to observations, telephone tapping, buggings, et cetera regarding matters relating to Mrs Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club.  I was at no stage involved in the tapping of telephones or the placement or monitoring of any bugs.   I know from personal knowledge that tapping of phone conversations did take place since I saw transcriptions of such conversations often.  I, however, did not read any conversations that related to Mrs Mandela or the football club.  I had personally nothing to do with the investigation of any of the activities of Mrs Mandela or the football club and can therefore not give any further information in this regard.       \n The killing of Sergeant Pretorius and two MK members, Maluleke and Mbnenge.  These events took place before I was transferred to the branch at Soweto and I have no personal knowledge of these events\".",

This is your affidavit.\n\"I am number 489 ...  a lieutenant in the South African Police stationed at the security branch Soweto.  In 1989 I went to Groblersdal as a result of information to follow up information in connection with a certain black man called Themba.  It was suspected that the black man was a trained African National Congress terrorist.  On the 20th February 1989 at about 12h00 Themba was arrested by me and I was informed that his real name was Johannes Mabotha.  It was found that the person was a trained terrorist and related to the SAP.  He was arrested during his infiltration and declared himself willing to work with the SAP but deserted again afterwards.  I investigated the subject and found in the left inside pocket of his jacket some documents with some names and addresses on.  One document was clearly used by a state department.  It dealt with Stompie Moketsi, the youth activist who had been murdered in Soweto.  The document reads the information by JKM.  I confronted him about the document and told me that JKM was an abbreviation for Johannes Kabodi Mabotha and that the document was in his own handwriting.  He told me that he had been told by Mrs Mandela to go to Botswana and to send the information in the documents through to the newspapers in South Africa.  He told me that Mrs Mandela had written the message which was in her handwriting on a piece of paper and he was supposed to rewrite this message and after that destroy the original.  The document was given to him at her home.  On another piece of paper telephone numbers of The Star and Sowetan were found as well as the names of the Citizen and City Press.  He told me that the details were also supplied by her, Winnie.  I confiscated the documents\".\nPlease have a look at this and see if it is your signature on the affidavit.",

I just mention this because it seems to me there is a discrepancy of two months here.   Your testimony is that he went back on exactly the same day.  Now let me put to you what Col Potgieter says.  He remembers, although he is not 100 per cent certain, that probably as he remembers it, Mabotha was taken back to the security police on the same day that he was arrested.  So that agrees with what you have been saying.   We don't know whether the detention register is correct.  It does seem as if there are mistakes.  Further I would like to say that Col Potgieter will testify, I took it up with him just now, that when Mabotha was admitted in terms of section 29 there were no visible signs of assault, that the process in terms of section 29 would have been to send him for a medical examination and that he, who was Col Potgieter, would have known exactly that Mabotha had been assaulted once the medical examination had taken place.

            "No.   I was at the head of the court orientated investigation unit of the security branch at Soweto during the time January 1987 to middle 1989. It might be a bit later than middle of '89. Then from October 1989 to December 1992 I worked as intelligence head of the Greater Soweto and Vaal Triangle area.\nSkip paragraph 5.  Paragraph 6.  The broad structure and components of the security branch at Soweto were as follows.  Administration, technical.  The technical component gave their testimonies yesterday.  They had to do with technical equipment.  Then the information gathering component where Watermeyer was and the intelligence or the advanced intelligence collection or gathering, such as Coetzee testified yesterday.  Then the terrorist tracing unit and then the court orientated investigations of which I was the chief. In paragraph 7. \nI would like to say that there was one great big investigation into Winnie Mandela called the Mandela investigation.  This investigation was into her helping activities with regard to trained MK terrorists.  It should be borne in mind that the security police investigated only those actions of Mrs Mandela which related to the security condition in our country.  His original idea was to use senior MK arrested members who were accomplices as ...   My conclusion was that the Attorney-General was of the opinion that Mrs Winnie Mandela could not be prosecuted by way of the use of the testimonies of accomplices but that such accomplices would first have to be charged and found guilty and then afterwards if they agreed they could testify against her.  With regard to the Attorney-General's opinion in this regard it was decided to open a separate high treason docket and to investigate this separately.  The cases against the accomplices were continued and many of them were successfully prosecuted.  The compilation of the high treason docket went ahead under my leadership and was eventually given to Advocate Klaus von Lieres.  The high treason investigation had nothing to do and did not overlap with the Stompie Seipei investigation, which was handled by murder and robbery.  The translation and the testimony on the cross-examination on pages 1602 and 1603  of the November interrogation is therefore confusing and does not give the correct picture.  It was said yesterday that I had a parallel investigation into the Stompie Seipei case with the Attorney-General.  That was wrong.  The matter to which we refer here was the high treason matter.  Further Advocate Von Lieres' attitude was that if he should prosecute Winnie Mandela he wanted to do it on a common law misdemeanour and not for a statutory political offence.  Although I cannot remember that he has told me this directly that was the conclusion I drew.  The high treason docket was presented to Advocate Von Lieres and according to his register this took place on the 3rd April 1989, file reference 63/89.  I personally went through it.  I have no knowledge of what happened to this docket.  I searched for it at the Attorney-General's office and couldn't find it.  This was during May 1997.  There was a signature.   I did this investigation after I spoke to Captain Mike Holmes, but couldn't find it.  There was a signature that it had been received, the docket had been received at the Attorney-General's office but no finding had been made with regard to the docket so there is no note whether the docket was referred to somebody else or whether there would be a prosecution.",

At the times I spoke to her I had no problem with her but she definitely had the attitude that she was elevated above the law.  No statements were taken because she never found herself within a situation where she was found in possession of certain weapons or that she was involved in scenes on the scene.  We had information but we had no evidence, no proof.  My intention with the high treason case was if the Attorney-General decided to prosecute, that we were then either going to arrest her or to serve a subpoena for her to appear in court.  That is what Col Kritzinger said yesterday.  As he testified yesterday undoubtedly she would have shown one the door.  Her actions at occasions before that was quite negative and un-co-operative.  After the Sehere case on 25 January she was interrogated at our offices by members of my staff.   I always say they interviewed her.  They went through her correspondence, et cetera, in the steel cabinets in her presence.  They took a statement which is attached as Annexure JDP in the middle of my document.  However, she refused to sign the statement.  And she didn't even want it to be read back to her.  It is annexure JDP 10. You will see on the right-hand at the top it says A 98.  And that was a statement by her which was filed in the Oupa Sehere case.  This statement I took from that docket at the Attorney-General's office.  While we are on that topic I would also like to refer you to\nJDP 9.   That is a statement under oath of her daughter Zinzi Mandela.  And that relates to the finding of the Scorpion pistol a month later, in February 1987.  Exactly a month after the Sehere case.",

With regard to a shooting incident in Soweto where an MK member known as V during a shooting incident under command of Colonel Grobbelaar was involved.  There was a blood trail to Mrs Mandela's house and my entry for that date was as follows.  It is cryptical but\n\"Soweto.  Accompanied Brigadier Coetzee ...\"\nHe is now Lieutenant General Coetzee. \n\"... to a scene of an explosion\".\nThat is where the firing took place.  We visited the house of Winnie Mandela at 8h00. There were traces of blood in front of the gate, at the intercom.  These were photographed and removed.  Secondly Mrs Mandela denied any knowledge.  \n\"3. The intercom rang inside the house.\n 4. No one was arrested.\n 5. Denied that there was blood at the back door\".\nThat is the entry for that day.

            "Mrs Mandela said in her evidence  the abovementioned was the father of one of her grandchildren and that it was killed by the police.  The situation with regard to Sithole and some of the other youths she has been with who had been killed or died in Soweto is as follows according to what I think.  Mrs Mandela, through what she said and confrontation and because of the fact that she didn't have respect for the NP and the government, entrenched herself amongst the youth.  The youth who had been with her have been influenced by her and they were untouchable because she has been seen as \"the mother of the nation who should protect them\".   Mrs Mandela also, because of her own evidence, allowed that a number of other military trained MK members visited her house and she also has been friends with youth who could be seen as militants and they had been seen as her big brothers.  In this regard especially I would like to refer you to statements which specifically relates to that.  We also don't have evidence to the effect that Mrs Mandela and the other youths who had been part of the football club could be involved in that.   I think that Mrs Mandela is responsible for the deaths of those individuals mentioned;  Sithole, a youth in the abovementioned category - I am not exactly sure about the date but another youth called Kenneth Dhlamine also known as Sithole was killed with an AK47 assault weapon.  Kenneth Dhlamini was during 1987 detained by the security branch in terms of section 29 in another case.  We can find this evidence in annexure JP 7, paragraph 7.  Persons who have seen the murder of Dhlamini, it identified Sithole as the murderer.  Sithole succeeded in not being arrested and got away during the time that he was still free.  There were a number of shootings in Soweto.  Those were on members of the S A Police and a number of those people were killed.  Ballistic investigations indicated that two AK47 rifles were involved in this.  One of the AK47 weapons was ballistically linked with the murder of Dhlamini.   A young man in possession of an AK47 rifle was arrested and at a later stage he seemed to have been Sizwe Sithole.  And he was taken to the Protea security branch.  As unit head I was told that he was arrested.  In terms of Act 51 everything was afterwards all right.  Sithole was further interrogated as far as I can remember.  He made certain admissions.  I can't remember detail.  The AK47 which was in his possession was taken by hand to the ballistic unit and we have been informed telephonically that that was the weapon with which Dhlamini was murdered and which was used in other shootings.  After my allowed 48 hours of detention he was freed in terms of section 29.  I can't exactly remember what was the reason for why he was detained in the John Vorster Plein police cells.  I suppose because of the constructural changes they were accommodated in other places.  I did not lead the interrogation but I did speak to him and I asked him how he was.  I didn't want to involve myself in the interrogation of those people because my staff are competent.  At this stage Sithole had no complaints with regard to his physical condition.  He was also not interrogated in one of the soundproof units but in one of the other offices.  He didn't seem to be depressed or emotionally unstable.  A few days after his arrest, at about 17h00, I was informed telephonically that Sithole died during detention in John Vorster and I was told so at home.  Because of the fact that he was linked with the Mandela family Mr De Klerk, the state president, then appointed a judicial commission for this purpose under Judge Goldstone.   We have written a briefing with regard to this.  Documentation with regard to notes by Mr Augustyn were shown to me and those indicate that Mr Sithole by misdeeds could be involved in those.   I also don't recall any involvement by Mrs Mandela by Sithole.  I would, however, like to refer to the investigation and the record of in camera evidence by Judge Goldstone in which it is being referred to Mr Augustyn where mention is made of Mrs Mandela and her daughter.  No further documentation in my investigation could provide any link between Mrs Mandela and her daughter on the one hand and Mr Sithole on the other hand and his criminal deeds.",

Paragraph 3: It is apparently common cause that the deceased was killed as recorded, that is to say shortly after he was handed by me to De Kock.  I deny in the strongest possible terms that I handed him with the purpose of having him killed and the reason for this as well as the surrounding circumstances appears from the following.\n\"During the time of 1987 to 1989 I worked as investigation chief at Soweto.  In '89 I got instructions from Pretoria to investigate high treason against Mrs Mandela and to give the docket to the Attorney-General Wits for his decision.  The motivation with this instruction was that Mrs Mandela lived in Soweto and that she, according to information, had been  involved in various actions as recorded.  During the running of this investigation I obtained evidence, documentation and other material.  It was seen to that Mrs Mandela's phones at her home and at her office were tapped in terms of the Post Office Act section 118.  During the tapping the name of a person named George Johannes Mabotha appeared and it could be deduced that he was a trained MK member.  During tapping it was determined that George found himself in Marble Hall, that he needed money to return to Soweto and that he asked Mrs Mandela to telegraph money to the local Marble Hall post office for him.  Upon receipt of the mentioned money George was arrested 0by the security police Soweto, although I was not personally present.  According to the detention registers he was arrested on 4 April and was detained in accordance with section 29 of the Internal Security Act.  He was released on the 4th October\".",

There seems to be a big discrepancy between the day on which he was arrested and the day on which he was detained.  I am not sure what happened there.  That appears to be the case if one looks at the statement under oath of Mrs Ngadimeng.  You must  remember that a person can be detained only for six months in terms of section 29 and before you could go to the revision committee, which I couldn't do because the interrogation had been completed, I couldn't get a warrant under section 31 because the Attorney-General had not given a finding so I had to release Mabotha.

I reported to the head office in Pretoria as such and they were adamant that the docket should be completed and should be delivered to Mr Von Lieres.  We then proceeded and I prepared it scientifically.   Like I have said before it wasn't finalised.  There were certain other evidence but we prepared the docket and we gave it to Mr Von Lieres.  And there it stayed.  Now I found myself in the dilemma that Mr Mabotha was detained.

And that is that because of the limited time for cross-examination here both my client and Mr Hugo's client their rights will be prejudiced if their legal representatives cannot cross-examine the other party properly on the issues where there are conflicting versions.  We will be limited to a very limited time of cross-examination which at the end of the day might prejudice our rights of cross-examination for a longer period at the amnesty hearing which would at the end result cause much difficulty if anything prejudicial comes out of this limited cross-examination, for the amnesty hearing in future.  It could prejudice it totally, there could be all sorts of legal problems arising and that is why that agreement was made.   Now if cross-examination is to be done here on that basis then obviously we will have to deal with cross-examination in full in respect of the versions and that is what we try to prohibit.  And secondly I just want to state that as Mr Vally said the agreement was pertaining to conflicting versions in the amnesty application but at the end of the day it is also about credibility and the question my learned friend Mr Hugo wants to pose is a question relating to credibility and if that is the case then I have lots of other questions which I am going to ask Col De Kock which also falls in the same category as the question my learned friend wants to ask now.",

But we quite clearly cannot have the luxury of a cross-examination that would go to the lengths that any lawyer would desire cross-examination to go in a court of law.  So we are trying to find a mechanism to bridge the demands of fair representation and the demands of us having to do that which we have to do here.  You must remember that there is still an opportunity in terms of section 13 when an adverse finding is going to be made against any of the people who are affected by the evidence or by the finding that we may come to that that person will be called upon to make written representation and if it becomes necessary for the particular witness to be called for further cross-examination so there are in-built mechanisms in the act itself where an adverse inference is going to be drawn from the evidence that will be led.

This interrogation finished at between three and four, it could be later but there was no interruption.  When one group was tired then another two, the groups were two, then another group took over, he was in a blanket, his clothing had been taken off so that it would not get urine on it, that it was not torn or blood stained or anything.  The blanket was his so that no marks would be shown, despite friction.  He was strangled, he was hit he was kicked, care was taken that no bones were broken and care was taken that his face was not harmed badly although his nose and his mouth did bleed, but it was not a continual run of blood.  He was also strangled, I don't remember if it was a wet sack or rubber, he was also hung upside down, he was seriously assaulted.\n Seriously does not necessarily mean that you bash open his head or break his back.  That afternoon he was a tired, broken, hurt man nevertheless he stuck with his report that he had been kidnapped and had been detained and that was when he told me later that he was being kept as a sex slave.  That was new to me in my career, I just couldn't accept that because he had a chance of running away.  That was what Mabota went through that day.  \n I have been a part of many interrogations of different degrees, difficult ones, easier ones, normal conversational ones, it depends on the operators and of the person being interrogated, whether he cooperates immediately, whether he's a hardened person, whether he would rather die than to testify and according to that such a person would then be interrogated on the grounds of whether he cooperated.

I wouldn't say who called whom because I can't remember, but I know the area very poorly but if one travels towards the police station from de Deur in an eastern direction, you see a crossroads, one goes north and one goes south there.  We moved from north to south first, past the turn-off for de Deur, we met him along the road and discussed the strategy and then from them myself and Wouter Mentz in a vehicle and Col Potgieter in his, because he had to go and get the person cleared out at the police station.  A second vehicle was driven by Louw van Niekerk and Dawid Britz.  When Col Potgieter left the police station, they would move from the turn-off road of de Deur in a western direction and make a U-turn at a reasonable distance where they would stop, Col Potgieter would then give Mabota, hand him over to Louw van Niekerk and to Dawid Britz.  They were both big and strong with the excuse that he was going to Vlakplaas.  This handing over took place at that distance so that identification by the police at de Deur would not have been possible.\n As a result of the plan that had to be made with Mabota, there were already two explosive experts to secure the place.  They had to make sure that there were no herd boys or hunters or anybody.  A second vehicle waited at the Bapsfontein highway, a land cruiser.  Mabota went with van Niekerk and Britz to that point.  He was transferred to the land cruiser and some of those then went to I think a certain mine.   We waited at the western side of the police station as a cut-off point if there would have been a fight at the handing over of Mabota and we first went to Vlakplaas.  I do not know why but it was quit that we went and from there I went to the Penge Mine and just before the entrance to the mine we collided with a big rotweiler dog and damaged my vehicle.  Maybe some people will remember that.  \n On the other side of Penge Mine I found Mabota, his were tied behind his back, he had not been assaulted, he was not asked any more questions.  I asked him where the weapons were, whether they had been taken out and he said he knew of nothing.  I said that's good and we took him down to the groove of the mine where there was already a block with 25 kg of plastic explosives.  \n When Mabota turned around I shot him two shots into his heart after each other.  Then his clothing was removed, his hands were untied and he was placed on top of the explosives.  I then walked off because exploding bodies was not in my line.  I actually buried people in the Republic and in Angola because one has to go on with the fight but we buried them later, so I can later explain to you why we made use of the explosives.

She did stand on her legs, she really exposed herself, I'm not trying to plead for her, there should be no uncertainty about that.

The normal procedure would have been that Security Branch or Division might feel that there was a presence of ANC members or operational members in their area, they would then request via head office for a group of askaris and we would look which of the askaris possibly might know some of those terrorists or trained people who might have been trained with them, who might know their family and the moment that they were deployed from Vlakplaas then the commander of the askari group fell under the divisional head of the security branch wherever that is, Durban, Cape Town etc.  From there the commander would go and appoint a member normally a member of the anti-insurgents' unit and say these are the members, task them with specific goals.  Would a Stratcom unit or anybody, should they need an askari, they would go to the commander in charge for order, discipline and their tasking and would say I have these photographs that have to be identified, or can you help me with this interrogation, or whatever.  These are situations on the periphery but the main task was the tracing and arresting of an MK member and especially the confiscation of weapons, ammunition and explosives afterwards because the moment you could do that, you have half an anti insurgent soldier, in other words, his teeth have been extracted.  You haven't done everything but that was a beginning.",

The Attorney-General then also from the Department of Justice budget gave money to those people and if it was not enough I had no doubt that from the secret funds it will be topped up and in that regard there is one scenario, the scenario is that we have listened to how important Mabotha was, he was of cardinal importance at the Soweto Safety Branch and the head office were to be approached telephonically and to ask him whether they had kept him in safety.  It would have been followed up during, in the report.   Each safety branch had security funds which they could utilise and then later report on.  Furthermore there were safety houses and operational houses throughout the country at each branch and in isolation as well he could have been looked after and kept there.  Vlakplaas had no detaining facility, it was not a camp, people went and go as they wished and Mabotha, after I attacked him at Marble Hall, wouldn't have returned.  I can assure you of that.   I had no grip on him in any way to prevent him from leaving it again.  If one looks at the internal security police structure, there was no way that Mabotha could be travelling to his parents' home in Pietersburg and without being attacked by people within 24 hours; they have also listened in to telephone discussions, there is no way that Mabotha could have survived on his own without help of the security police.   The Askaris at Vlakplaas wouldn't have trusted him;  I couldn't, wouldn't have been able to use him for work.   If he was shot he would have been asked questions, I couldn't have loosed luck in any way but he sat and he painted pictures, but if something happened to him I would have lost my own head.

We don't want that.  I can whisper it to you but then I would also like you to protect those people and their lives. One day I have been brought into contact with Reverend Verryn.  The information I received from grassroots level at the gutters basically was that three corpses were buried of people killed by the Mandela Football Club, but again I didn't know that it was an effort to bring, to cast a negative light on people and somebody said to me they would bring me into contact with Reverend Verryn.  We did meet at the Carlton Hotel.  I was interested in getting hold of the four corpses.   Winnie was not for me the argument of who killed them, let's first get hold of the four corpses.  He personally although he was a very pleasant man was very introvert.  I told him I was reluctant, he didn't want to speak to me.   I personally thought he was very strict and straightforward and I thought he was very devoted to his job but that was, that however was only a temporary meeting and I didn't immediately want to ask him about the corpses and this is not the way it's done.  And afterwards when I wanted to follow it up, he, all contact was broken.   I personally thought he was scared, the little bit of information I could gain I tried to follow up.\n However, with regard to Stompie Sepei I had no information on him apart from what I have read in the media.  At a later stage at the Adriaan Vlok police station there was a short conversation with me and perhaps it will be said later that the name of Stompie Sepei was mentioned to me, namely that Mabotha was the chief evidence, witness in the Stompie Sepei case.",

The impression one gains from listening to all the previous witnesses who were all members of security branch at some stage or the other is that the Soweto security branch unlike all the other security branches in the country was a model police station.  None of the officers committed any torture, none of them witnessed any torture, they followed every possible procedure.\n Now in your view, you worked with members of the security branch in Soweto.

Murder and Robbery it is legendary and I think they are even worse than the security police, perhaps they could even compete at the Olympic Games.\n Then you also had the vehicle branches who I followed them closely as a young policeman.  After three or four months of service I saw that they strangled a man at Benoni because they wanted information and they would go to all lengths to get it.  Today that is still the case.  If one reads the papers, it is still going on.  I nevertheless leave that here but that's not what it is all about.  \n The security policemen were dedicated, I got to know many of them as good people, some of them had compassion, some of them less and others had none, so I think one should look at this in a general way.   \n To come back on the question of the situation, if any of our wives were present and experienced what Mrs Mandela experienced, they would have done the same.  Her husband had been banned, she couldn't see him.  Children grew up around her, they couldn't see him. She has been banned, she has been trampled and now she's jumping up and down and she scares everybody in the country.   That takes guts and I am not trying - she also makes me as - scares me.",

The tone of the story was that Jimmy Mbane had worked for them, I don't know whether he was, what he did for them, but he was a problem for them at that stage and the request was that he had to be eliminated, and when we went away from there I said to Klopper \"if they want to kill him, they've got to do it themselves\".

And let me say that it leaves me with a great sense of sadness, the great disregard for life that there was from your unit and yourself, but be that as it may, just let me understand this whole process.  Here you have a man who spent six months in detention, we are told by this very senior police officer that he develops a very close relationship, he gets all the information he wants from Mr Mabotha;  at the end of the six months he has to release him and yet of course he had a sense that nothing is going to happen in terms of prosecution.   But that still doesn't give me a reason why he feels this person should be killed.  On the other side we know that Mr Mabotha was an ANC trained person, he turned to be an Askari, he'd been with your unit, he'd actually managed to get away and you say it might have been because they'd gone, for want of a better expression AWOL, gone to Soweto, had been drinking or whatever else.  So it didn't concern you initially but just let's remember that we're talking about 1988 when your unit is still functioning in a covert way, that even in 1990 when Judge Goldstone had an enquiry, you said something very different that they couldn't come to a conclusion on the covert activities that you were involved in.   Now is there a real possibility that in fact Mr Mabotha had gone to Mrs Madikizela-Mandela to get protection so that he was actually going to blow the lid on what was happening at Vlakplaas?",

Further, Mabotha was, had already been away from Vlakplaas for long enough that he could have told Mrs Mandela anything he wanted to about Vlakplaas so it's no use to close the stable after the horse has gone.  The information had been relayed, there was nothing we could do about it any more and with the Harms Commission in '89 Dirk Coetzee washed us out of the water, as it were.  It was not that Vlakplaas was a secret any more.  What happened after that they simply tried to perform damage control to close up the worst leaks.  We didn't have to kill him to stop the secret from getting out.  It was no longer a secret.  In fact there was one situation where a member came from Botswana to reconnoitre Botswana but he never got there because he lost his way.  It's not as though Vlakplaas, but it was already known to the ANC, so much so that in '82 pamphlets were distributed by the ANC with a total of eight Askaris' photos of them, their names, MK names, full descriptions and this was distributed throughout the country that if these people were seen they worked for the security police and they were called \"death to the impimpis\".
