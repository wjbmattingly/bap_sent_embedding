            "CHAIRPERSON",
            "We welcome you all including media representatives and witnesses. I want to pay a special tribute to my colleagues, the Commissioners and Committee Members in this region who have worked so very hard to prepare for this hearing.  And also our staff, to thank Patrick and all of the staff for working so assiduously. I pay a very warm tribute to my colleagues for all of their dedication.  And we are grateful to the trustees of this place for making this beautiful venue available.\n The TRC is tautologically a Commission. It is not and we must stress this, the TRC and this hearing is not a Court of Law and so this hearing is not a trial. We operate under a Founding Act entitled The Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act. \n That Act mandates us to provide as, and I quote \"complete a picture as possible of the nature, causes and extent of gross violations of human rights committed during the period from the 1st March 1960\", that is to include the Sharpeville Massacre of 21st March 1960, \"to the 10th May 1994\", the inauguration of the first democratically elected President, i.e. Nelson Mandela.\n These gross violations must have emanated from the conflicts of the past. We are required to ascertain the fate and whereabouts of the victims of such violations, and this is done by one of three Committees of which the Commission is constituted, the Human Rights Violations Committee; we are mandated also to grant amnesty to persons making a full disclosure relating to acts committed with a political motive during this period of 34 years, and this is the work of our Amnesty Committee; and we are then expected to provide for reparations to be granted to victims of gross violations, and this is the work of our third committee, the Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee.\n We are required among the recommendations we will make to the President at the end of the life of this Commission, at present July 31st, next year, to provide recommendations that are aimed at a prevention of the commission of gross violations of human rights in the future, and so we are not a Court of Law. I repeat this is not a trial.  There won't be a verdict of guilty or innocent at the end of this hearing or inquiry, come Friday.\n We are gathered to ascertain as much of the truth as we can establish about allegations from those who made statements to the Human Rights Violations Committee. These are statements from the families of alleged victims of gross violations of human rights.\n The Act enjoins that we should be victim friendly; therefore we are always driven by the statements of victims or survivors, and it is no different in this particular instance. Our focus is not a particular individual or group against whom allegations are being made. As always, we are here concerned primarily for the victims and survivors.\n I said there will not be a verdict because we are not a Court. We are here not in order to put anyone in the dock. We are not intent on pilloring, on ridiculing or humiliating anyone. Our objective is to find out the truth in order to assist in the process of healing our land, to promote reconciliation and to ensure that the awful things we hear about will not happen again. \n We seek the truth, not for the purpose of prosecution, we seek the truth for the healing of our land. On Friday when this hearing finishes, we will not provide you or anyone with a verdict. No, as with all of our other hearings, we will as a Commission subsequently be making a finding as to whether gross violations of human rights have in fact taken place, and the Act is quite clear about what it regards as gross violations - abduction, torture, killing or severe - and we have to seek to establish the identity of the victims.\n The enquiry will assist us in writing our final report, which is to be handed to President Mandela July 31st 1998, which will then be tabled in Parliament for later dissemination to the nation. We have to report inter alia on the antecedents, circumstances, factors and context of the gross violations as well as the perspectives of the victims and the motives and perspectives of those responsible for them.\n The Act makes it absolutely clear that self-incriminating evidence cannot be used in criminal or civil proceedings against the person giving the evidence, but when we draw up our final report, we the Commission will decide on whether we make formal recommendations that the cases of people against whom there is prima facie evidence and who did not apply for amnesty or refused amnesty should be referred to Attorneys General. Whether or not we make such recommendations our process does not impinge upon the criminal justice system of the country, which continues to operate in the normal way.\n We seek again, may I emphasise, the truth, not for purposes of prosecution, but for the purpose of seeking to re-integrate people into our society. The fact that we are conducting this enquiry and that South African and international media have chosen to give it unprecedented attention does not mean that the Commission recognises a moral equivalence between those who fought apartheid and those who opposed it. We made the distinction that most normal human beings would make for instance when someone who is about to be raped kills the person who is going to rape her, that is not the same as when someone morally kills another because they wanted to hijack their car.\n We will consider in our final report whether those fighting apartheid had moral justification, more moral justification than those opposing it. We are not speaking about a moral equivalence. The Act speaks about a legal equivalence, that is when a gross violation of human rights as defined in that law happens then it is a gross violation of human rights, no matter who committed them. If violations are found to have been committed in specific instances by people who opposed apartheid, that is not a judgement on the struggle or its morality.\n I want to finish by just reminding us what the preamble of the Act says -\n\"The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1993 provides a historic bridge between the past of a deeply divided society, characterised by strife, conflict, untold suffering and injustice, and a future founded on the recognition of human rights, democracy and peaceful co-existence for all South Africans irrespective of colour, race, class, belief or sex.\nIt is deemed necessary to establish the truth in relation to past events as well as the motives for and circumstances in which gross violations of human rights have occurred and to make the findings known in order to prevent a repetition of such acts in future.\" \n And the Constitution states that the pursuit of National Unity, the well-being of all South African citizens and peace require reconciliation between the people of South Africa and the reconstruction of society.  And the Constitution states that there is a need for understanding but not for vengeance; a need for reparation, but not for retaliation; a need for ubuntu, but not for victimisation.\n And the Constitution states that in order to advance such reconciliation and reconstruction amnesty shall be granted in respect of acts, omissions and offences associated with political objectives committed in the course of the conflicts of the past. \n And the Constitution provides that Parliament shall under the Constitution adopt a law which determines a firm cut-off date and before the cut-off date envisaged in the Constitution provides for the mechanisms, criteria and procedures including tribunals, if any, through which amnesty shall be dealt with, and it is in the spirit of that preamble that we gather today and for the next four days.\n May I introduce my colleagues on the panel. On the extreme end is Faizel Randera, who is a Commissioner and member of the Human Rights Violations Committee and he is the Regional Convenor of our Region here in Gauteng. \n Hlengiwe Mkhize is a Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee. She is based here in Gauteng.\n Dumisa Ntsebeza is a Commissioner and Head of our Investigative Unit. He is based in Cape Town.\n Alex Boraine is the Deputy Chairperson of the Commission, and on my left is Yasmin Sooka. She is a Commissioner and Deputy Chairperson of the Human Rights Violations Committee, and is based here in Gauteng. \n Khoza Mgojo is a Commissioner, member of the Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee, and is based in our KwaZulu Natal/ Free State office in Durban.\n There are these contraptions for those of you who will be wanting to use them to follow the translation, Channel 2 is English, Channel 3 Zulu and Channel 4 Sotho.\n The first witness to testify is Thami Hlatswayo. Order, please. The witness is on my left and on that panel there, formidable, are lawyers who will be representing witnesses, and in front there is Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and her legal team.  And over there are the TRC, Hanif and his team.\n Thami, which language are you going to speak?",

Mrs Mandela got out of the kombi, they got in through the front door, Dipuo opened the door for them.  Dipuo is the owner of house No.3, and they got inside and got us there waiting for them, and Peter asked Dipuo as to what had happened.  Dipuo said she didn't know anything but she referred to me and said they should ask me.  And I told them that we were inside the house, we were conducting a meeting with the aim of conducting a certain mission in Bophuthatswana, but the mission was not accomplished because I was told that I should wait only 15 minutes after Mrs Mandela had gone out.  And I told him that after 15 minutes he or she didn't show out. Later then I told Mrs Mandela that when I went out I came across Tsepo, who told me that as they approached the corner from a schoolmate's birthday party they saw a car hitting a person at the corner and that corner was not far from the house No.3.  I went back after getting this message with the aim of telling them that I had got this news.  And I heard the woman from next door, and said this car actually hit the person on the pavement, and I went into the house with that message and told Dipuo the very same message.

We even went to his friend's place, but we couldn't get hold of him, and we proceeded to Diepkloof, that is Winnie Mandela's house.  And when we got to Winnie's house, Winnie personally said to me, \"Guys, see what you are going to do with this one because she doesn't want to speak the truth\", referring to the Football Club members.  They started assaulting me and kicking me in accordance with Winnie's instructions and I think this continued for about five hours. And Zinzi came and asked as to what was happening and she pleaded with them to stop assaulting me, and they said, \"Mother, or Mummy, said we should assault her\", because that's how they referred to her.  And Zinzi went to her mother to try and find out as to why these guys were assaulting me, and Zinzi said I should go into the bathroom to clean myself up.  I was bleeding through my nose as well as my mouth.  And Jerry Richardson came in together with Morgan and she said ,\"Jerry and Morgan take this woman to her place,\" and they duly took me to my place.  When we got to my place my mother and I went to Dudu Xele.  My mother wanted to get some advice from Dudu Xele as to what to do under the circumstances.  We were sent to Mrs Sisulu.

If you are carrying a baby girl, we will just desert you and take you to your boyfriend's house, and we were joking over the issue.\n On Saturday morning Thole came and we were happy. And in the afternoon he said he was going to a night vigil in Pimville and I asked which night vigil was it, because you know my mother is not around, and why are you going to the night vigil.  And he said, no, it's one comrade's night vigil that I am going to attend.  And I said, please Thole take care of yourself and be careful.\n It was around nine at night and we heard a gunshot because we were not too far away where Thole died.  It was myself and Sisi, my cousin.  And we were so scared after hearing that gunshot because the way it was going on and on it was like it was shots just around the corner.  After a few minutes we heard knocks at the door, and it was Thole's friends, and they said, we do not know what we shall say to you, and I said, what's happening, what's wrong, and they said, Thole is late.  And I asked who?  They said, it is Sizwe.  I said, Sizwe?  They said, it is Sizwe, and they said they saw Sizwe and Buthile, who is another member of the Football Club there at Brandfort.  \n And I left the house and ran to the scene of crime and I realised and discovered that Thole was there and he was shot in the head, and there was a hole and the whole side from his left eye was open throughout to the back.  And I left the scene and went back home to get a blanket or something to cover the body.  My mother was not at home and I did not know what to do.

Where you say soon after Winnie's house in Orlando was burnt, then you go on to say Winnie and Shakes came to see your parents and Shakes came in first and briefed you that Winnie had sent for your brother but that she was really after you.  It's like the statement leading to a beating.  Can you just clarify to us what is the link between that visit and the burning of Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's house?  It's like there are two - I should think for the record's sake it's important for you to clarify what exactly were the circumstances, because it's like you linked it with the burning of the house, and also Shakes whispered to you that they haven't come for your brother but Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was after you, can you just clarify that?",

That's when I went into Mrs Mandela's car and Winnie said, \"Shakes, drive, we are going to my place, we are no longer going to the hall\", and as the house had been burnt, that has got nothing to do with the assault.",

            "On the 13th November I had gone to church.  Siboniso's father was at home at the time, and I arrived at home around about seven in the evening.  When I got home, Siboniso's father explained to me that there were certain young men, two of them, who had a box of matches with, and at the back of this box there was Siboniso's name as well as his address, and Lolo Sono's address and Lolo's name.\n As he was still explaining to me, he told me that this young men came twice to our place, and as he was still explaining I heard a knock at the door and I saw two young men. Mr Shabalala said to these young men, my boys, sit down, I am Siboniso's father and this is Siboniso's mother. I want you to explain as to why you are after Siboniso, does he owe you any money?  They said to us, aren't we aware that today Siboniso was supposed to leave, they were coming from Winnie Mandela's place, and Siboniso was supposed to cross the borders and we didn't know anything about that, and they said we were delaying them.  They stood up and went out at that moment. But Siboniso was not at home at that time. \n After about half past nine, Mr Shabalala went to Lolo's place. And when he got there, he asked Lolo's father as to whether these young men also came to his place and that they had his address, and Lolo's father said, they had already taken Lolo.   He had been assaulted by the members of the Mandela Football Club.  \n And Mr Shabalala came back to me and explained what he had been told by Mr Sono.  I was very surprised by this explanation, but I nevertheless asked, I said Winnie Mandela is involved in politics and how did she get involved with my son?  And Mr Shabalala said, he didn't know, he could offer me no explanation.\n I think Siboniso came at about ten or eleven that very same evening.  He was from a birthday party, and when he arrived, his father called him and told him that these young men said they would return.  He sat Siboniso down and explained. I was present when he talked to Siboniso. He told Siboniso about the young men who were looking for him beforehand, and Siboniso didn't seem to know anything about those young men.  He didn't seem to be aware of anything that could possibly make them look for him, and he kept on denying his knowledge of the young men.  And, as a mother, I said to Siboniso, I think we should take you away because Mr Sono had told us that Lolo had been assaulted, but Siboniso refused and said he will remain at home that particular night and he was waiting for those two young men to return.\n The following morning I went to Siboniso and asked him as to what we were going to do with this matter and he was sleeping on top of the bed, he wasn't inside his blanket, and he said he was going to wait for Winnie's people because if he ran away that would not help him in any manner because Lolo had already been assaulted.  And I asked Siboniso as to what relationship they had, or he had with Winnie, but he could not tell me.  His father also asked him, and he said he was not prepared to run away, he was going to remain and wait for the young men and hear as to what they wanted from him.  And he said whenever they come he would go with them and go to wherever Lolo was.  And we asked him as to whether he knew where Lolo was.  Then he said, if you say Lolo was taken by Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's people, then probably I will be taken there as well.\n And we left for work. When we came back Siboniso was not at home.  I looked for his shoes and his belongings as to whether he had taken anything with.  I saw that all his shoes were there except for one pair of shoes, and I realised that probably the pair that he was wearing, even the clothes that were missing were the ones that he was wearing the previous day.  \n In the evening when his father came, I explained to him and his father went to Mr Sono's place and explained to Mr Sono what had happened.  And Mr Shabalala said he had decided that he should go and report the matter.  He duly went to report.  \n My son disappeared on the 14th, that's when we got home and discovered he wasn't there.  And on the 15th Mr Shabalala went to the Meadowlands police station, and that's where he reported the matter.  He came back and filled me in as to what had happened.  And later on police arrived from Protea police station, and they said that he should report to the Protea police station.  He went there. When he came back I asked him as to what had happened, and he said they asked with regard to my son and said he should submit a statement.  Two days thereafter the police came to my place.  They searched the whole place.  They asked us as to whether Siboniso was involved in politics, and we said we were not a politically aware family. We had nothing to do with politics, but he was friends with Sono's son, that is our son.\n And time lapsed after the police had come to investigate.  They kept on calling Mr Shabalala to the police station.  And on this instance, that was in February, I think it was in 1989, when I was inside a taxi on the date I've mentioned, I was listening to the news and mention was made that at Meadowlands there are two young men missing, Siboniso Shabalala, as well as Lolo Sono.  That's when I realised that he had actually disappeared and it was well-known that he had disappeared and he was a member of the Mandela Football Club.  Mr Shabalala used to go to the newspaper reporters, Star, Sowetan, and he would give our son's photo to the reporters, and that our son had disappeared.  \n After a few days then I had heard this over the radio, a certain Mr Dempsey came to my place and he produced his identification that he was from Protea police station. He showed me a photo and asked me as to whether I knew the person on the photo, and I said this is my son.  I identified him positively.  He said he was going to take me on that particular day. I agreed because he had shown me a photo of my son.  He came back at about ten o'clock. He took me, that is Mr Dempsey, together with Mr Sono, his wife wasn't there, we went to Diepkloof mortuary.  When we got to the mortuary, they opened up the shelves.  They showed us some of the young men who had disappeared and they wanted us to identify them as to whether there were any people that we knew, but I couldn't get my son, and Mr Sono couldn't get his son as well.  We came back without having identified any of them.  I explained this to my HASSEN, and my HASSEN was surprised by this whole turn of events.\n After that we heard the stories doing the rounds that Stompie had died, and that there were certain members of the Football Club who had been killed.  It's only then that we were made aware of the goings-on at Winnie's house and we started reading newspapers.  At some stage they were called to the High Court.  They submitted statements.  Immediately after submitting the statements, Mr Shabalala said   [Tape ends.]",

            "...  he thought that they would see Winnie Mandela, that they did not, and they said they were not allowed to speak to Winnie.  It was said that they were not fit to speak to Winnie, and Dempsey accompanied them through the passages, taking them out.\n Quite some time lapsed, then in 1994 my HASSEN came back from work, and he went out saying that he was going to Dobsonville. He was shot in Dobsonville and he died.  That was on the 12th of August, and I went to fetch him. I buried my HASSEN but I haven't yet got wind as to where Siboniso is.  There's something that I've forgotten, when Siboniso had gone - that is after a day, or a day after Siboniso's disappearance, he phoned and said: \"Mum, I'm with Lolo\", but thereafter he couldn't speak any further because the phone was cut off.\n I buried my HASSEN on the 12th of August, and on the 15th of October early in the morning - I think it was about 4 o'clock or 3, I heard a knock at the door. When I went to answer it, I first peeped through the window and I saw a White man who said he was a policeman and I should open the door. I opened the door.  This policeman said I should open the gate. I went to fetch the key, I opened up the gate - they got into my yard.  \n There were two policemen outside and the other one had jumped over the fence in order to gain entry.  They said they were looking for Shadrack - Shadrack was my HASSEN. I told them that Shadrack was late.  They asked me as to when he had died. I told him that he died on the 12th of August. They said they were very sorry to hear that and they showed me a photo. They asked me as to whether I could identify the person on the photo. I said, yes, I said, this is my son.  \n They said they'd just come to tell me that my son died a long time ago and I was surprised by this revelation.  I asked them about Lolo. They said:  \"We have come to tell you about your son, your own son Siboniso.  If you want to know more about Siboniso as to how he died or where he died, whether you want to see him, you should go Pretoria police station, and you should ask all the questions that you are asking us\".  That when's they left. They left the photo with and they went away.\n I woke my children up after these people had left. They asked me as to where I got Siboniso's photo. I told them that it had been brought in by the police.  The children were quite surprised and they said, if I go there, I should take R4 000 with.  I never went there because I did not have that much money. I was not able to because they said to me they didn't want to tell me about Lolo, they wanted to tell me about my own son.  And I realised that if I go there without this R4 000 there wasn't much they could help me with.  I was all by myself, my HASSEN had died and I couldn't raise the money.\n After quite some time Mr Sono went to Cape Town.  When they talked in Cape Town, it was revealed, or it appeared on TV, the discussions that they had.  And when they came back this policeman Dempsey was already at my place - I don't remember the other one, but they were travelling in three cars.  And when they came they asked me as to what Mr Sono was doing in Cape Town. I told them that he had gone to talk about children.  They said he mentioned Siboniso's name - do I know anything about Siboniso. I told them that the police had come to explain to me about Siboniso, and I didn't know as to what to do with regards to this information.\n Dempsey took this photo of Siboniso. He said he was the investigating officer in this particular matter, and I told him that it's been 9 years since he's been handling the case, he doesn't want us to speak to Winnie, but he said he was safeguarding our interests. And that was very peculiar, it sounded very peculiar to me. He even came to take the photo but he had another photo of Dempsey. But he said wants to take the photo because it was brought by the police who had come to tell me that Siboniso had died.  I told Dempsey to take the photo. I told him that I'm asking for help and he was not helping me in any way, and that's the last I saw of Dempsey.",

That they are uttered almost in a cavalier manner and in a jocular sense is to be regretted.  That the processes would indicate the limitation of testing the correctness of some of his versions is also limiting in our ability to demonstrate the truthfulness of the allegations which are made or otherwise, but most importantly when we look at the documents that have been given to us now, they are not the same.  By way of illustration, you would find the statement of the witness now which reads and has a vehemence which are not in another section of the statement.  We do not know whether in the light of the seriousness of these allegations, whether we're not even entitled to be given the actual statements of these witnesses.  The evidence as we hear it makes serious allegations about matters for which Jerry Richardson has applied for amnesty. Surely we would have been entitled to obtain documents of this amnesty to understand how Jerry Richardson owns up to that particular event.
