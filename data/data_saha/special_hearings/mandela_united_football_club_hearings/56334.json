It was a meeting at Mr Aubrey's offices in Braamfontein, there were very few people, I think about eight or so.  I think Sister Bernard was there, Mr Mufamadi was there, Dr Naude was there, whereby I raised the first concerns of our second in that meeting, and it was at that meeting where I could not find the kind of answers that we were looking for and therefore I felt that the only way was for me to try and actually go to Mrs Mandela and that's when I invited Father Simangiliso and Bishop Manas to go with me to Mrs Mandela.\n The meeting with Mrs Mandela happened on the 13th, Friday 13th and I think my diary here of 1989 bears to that, that the Friday, the 13th was on a Friday, not on the 18th as Bishop Storey has said.  And therefore the sequence of events, the incident of the meeting with Mrs Mandela happened at a point when all those young people were still in the custody of Mrs Mandela and that's what we had gone there for, to try and secure the release of those boys from Mrs Mandela.",

I think different individuals, different collectives, different organisations, different structures did different things in order to address this issue.  As I have already pointed out the Crisis Committee was in fact almost solely responsible for co-ordinating all efforts that were designed to try to normalise this situation.  So when we went to Mrs Mandela's house again our mandate was not to go there see the boys and get them released, that was not really the purpose of our visit.  As Reverend Mbangula has pointed out, quite frankly it was really more a pastoral visit.  Because from experience, and as the good Archbishop would know there comes a time when either politicians or certain groups may be in conflict and you probably need a person who can be regarded as rather neutral to act as a mediator or to act as a counsellor whatever the case may be.  So I think that's how we saw our role and we've no reason to disagree with the way the Crisis Committee saw the situation.

            "Mr Chairperson of Mr Cachalia is particularly relevant.  Mr Murphy Morobe did not make his statement in the air from the statement given to us by Mr Cachalia, he is jointly responsible as an official, a senior official of the then United Democratic Front.  More important, for a lot of the relevant period Mr Morobe was not in the country or was in detention.  Mr Cachalia is in a better position to do what we have to in terms of our function. I refer to Section 4 amongst others.  If you look at Section 4 Subsection A, subsection Roman numeral 2, \"The functions of the Commission shall be to achieve it's objectives and to that end the Commission shall facilitate and where necessary a co-ordinating inquiry into the nature, causes and extent of gross violations of human rights, including the antecedent's circumstances, factors, contexts and motives which led to such violations.\"  The underlying theme of the hearings this week has been the activities of the Mandela United Football Club.  The Mandela United Football Club is loosely regarded as having been part, and they can dispute this in the submission but part of the wider  Mass Democratic Movement.  Surely the leadership of that particular movement should explain and this is coming from investigators, it's not a finding yet but should explain the kinds of actions that took place under the auspices or within the ambit of the activities of the Football Club and the youths surrounding the Football Club within the broader framework of the Mass Democratic Movement which I would submit the Mandela Football Club members who regarded themselves as being part of.\n So I think Mr Cachalia's evidence is particularly relevant. The section that Mr Semenya is referring to are the pervious four hearings that we have determined for this particular hearing.  The Section reads as follows.  \"The panel conducting the hearing may in it's sole discretion\", and I'll go straight to 1.2,  \"make a ruling on any relevant matter during the course of the hearing on the relevant matter\".  This matter is particularly relevant if you look at Mr Cachalia's submission, he talks about the background to the events.  He talks about his role in the United Democratic Front. He talks about the possible causes as to why such, and I use this word guardedly but also consciously, such an anomaly, and the reason I use this word anomaly, and that's a euphemism, such as the United Football Club could have arisen. It's very important for us to determine why it's a euphemism is that we have a series of cases where people who belong to this football club have ether been charged of very serious crimes or have been convicted of very serious crimes.",

            "May I proceed Chair?  Thank you.  I am an adult male residing in Johannesburg, I'm an attorney by profession and I'm currently employed by the government of South Africa as head for the Secretariat for Safety and Security within the Department of Safety and Security.  In preparing this statement at the request the Commission, I haven't come here on my own accord, I have come here at the Commission's invitation.  It is my hope that it will contribute to a better understanding of the tragedy really which is the subject matter of this inquiry.  The statement deals with the events leading to the issuing of a statement by the Mass Democratic Movement on the 16th of February 1989.  It was a statement which my colleague Murphy will deal with in greater detail but it essentially deals with the question of why the Mass Democratic Movement chose to distance itself from the conduct of Mrs Mandela and the Football Club.  It is however necessary for me to try and explain the circumstances which prevailed at that time.  A state of emergency was in force since June 1986.  During 1988 government intensified it's repression of leaders and organisations of the Anti Apartheid Movement.  In February of 1988 the United Democratic Front, COSATU as well as many of the UDF's key affiliates were effectively prohibited by government proclamation from engaging in any political activity.  In addition a prohibition was imposed on the receipt of any foreign money.  All our Soweto based affiliates were effectively restricted.  Virtually the entire leadership of the UDF was either in detention or on trial and those who were not incarcerated were given severe restrictions.  Comrade Albertina Sisulu and I were two such people.  Effectively my restriction barred me from participating in any political activity including my duties as national treasurer of the UDF.\n Now the number of detentions under both the emergency regulation and security laws was approximately five thousand that year.  Many were released but a core of one thousand remained.  In the Transvaal as it was known at that time the largest categories of detainees was students and community workers, as the State tried to contain the education crises and the rent boycott.  In Soweto large numbers of members of the Soweto Student's congress, Soweto Youth Congress, the Soweto Civic Association remained in jail. The ban on all outdoor gatherings remained in force under the Internal Security Act.  Other gatherings were banned or restricted under the emergency regulations. Areas like  Soweto were effectively under a political curfew.  Any political activity which escaped this net could not be reported.  Newspapers such as South, the New Nation and the Weekly Mail were temporarily suspended.  \n To say that it was difficult to operate to operate politically under these conditions was therefore and understatement.  It was just about impossible.  Despite this, the risk of sounding too cliched, the struggle continued.  Our instrument was the Mass Democratic Movement.  The MDM was in essence a sort of underground or informal organisation of COSATU and the UDF.  It was able to broaden it's scope of political influence over the country as it became apparent that the National Party really had no answer other than repression.  While detainees embarked on hunger strikes to secure their release, groups of MDM activists continued to use every conceivable subterfuge to meet in defiance of their emergency restrictions.  However as organisations were not able to meet formally the normal procedures used by democratic organisations namely mandates, proper recording of decisions and reporting back were often difficult to adhere to.  Our structures had therefore been weakened and our linkages with youth groups in particular became tenuous.  The youth and children of course bore the brunt of the State's brutality.  One commentator describes its effects in the following way. \"The Detainees' Parents Support Committee reported solders picking children off the streets at random and holding them for several hours in police vehicles or in remote areas of the veld. The children were beaten with fists and rifle butts, whipped with sjamboks and subjected to electric shock treatment.  By mid 1985, thousands of unaffiliated youths lacking direction of cohesion, many of them badly affected by their experiences in detention, bore themselves as soldiers in the liberation struggle.  They formed groups of street patrols hunting down other trouble makers, hooligans and vandals.  Initially they confined themselves to situations they came across as they patrolled the streets.  Then disputes were brought to them to \"judge\".  The effect of these gangs on the community, particularly in Soweto was extraordinarily destabilising.  As evidence began to emerge that the police both tacitly and actively showed support for some of these gangs, the fear they generated increased.   All the township residents were horrified by the disorder and the challenge to their authority by some of these young thugs.  In some cases gang control replaced people's courts which really in their non-violent form have long been a traditional form of dispensing justice in some of our communities.  Previously street committees made up of respected residents, almost without exception, men who were elected by members of the few streets or blocks they represented settled domestic and minor disputes.  At their best they gave a direct speedy and local participation in the pursuit of justice.  Now they became personal fiefdoms and small power bases using extreme forms of punishment.  This is the climate Sir in which Mrs Mandela created her own personal vigilante gang, the Mandela United Football Club.\n I think my initial response when hearing about this Football Club was that it was inappropriate to use the revered Mandela name in this way.  Surely there were other ways that Mrs Mandela could assist youths. I however had no contact with Mrs Mandela since the end of 1987 when I joined a new law firm.  I had seen Mrs Mandela regularly before this when I practised in my previous law firm which also represented the Mandela family.  After this the precious little time I had outside my practice was used to keep the UDF or MDM structures alive.  I also had very little direct contact with the Soweto based structures.  I did however begin to hear very disturbing reports of what could only be described as the criminal activities of the Football Club.  There were many rumours that circulated.  In the absence of any independent means of verification it was impossible to separate fact from fiction.  There were however a few common themes which recurred. And there were three broad themes that I want to talk about.\n The one is that the Football Club often dispensed their frightening brand of justice which included vicious assaults in cases ranging from domestic disputes to those who crossed their paths and were branded as informers.  It was widely spoken about in the community that Mrs Mandela often directed these operations.  Secondly there had bees stories that children had disappeared from the Mandela home. It was unclear however whether they had been killed by the Club, the police or had left the country, but there were parents who continued to ask questions about where their children were and this caused a great degree of anxiety in the community. \n The third broad theme was that the Football Club was infiltrated by the police and that some of it's measures actually worked for the police.  Some members of the community held the view that Mrs Mandela herself was working with the police.  This was because just everyone seemed to be aware that there were guerrillas and arms in the Mandela home.  Some of them had been involved in armed incidents in the township, some even ended up being arrested. In one case two guerrillas were killed after a shoot out with police for which Jerry Richardson was subsequently paid R10 OOO by the police.  A person associated with Mrs Mandela was convicted and sentenced and the guerrilla was sentenced to death following an incident in a shebeen which resulted in a person being killed.  There is Chairperson incidentally court records around all these cases.  There appeared to be no political motive which resulted in that person being killed.  \n Perhaps the most sickening case to my memory involved the abduction of two youths by members of the Club who were then brought to the  Mandela home where they were accused of being informers.

            "was sliced into his chest with a pen knife and the words viva ANC was carved down his thigh.  Battery acid was then poured over his open wounds.  The second youth also had the words viva ANC carved on his back.  At a subsequent trial involving some people of the Club, the victims were unable to identify the perpetrators of the crime. It was however common cause that this particular act took place in the home.  The magistrate had incidentally said at the end that these two people had been so horrified, so scared at what had happened, that when they managed to run away it was understandable that they were not able to identify their assailants.\n Now in none of these cases was Mrs Mandela charged or called as a witness and this of course fuelled some of the rumours around her. \n Now when the conflict and pupils at Daliwonga High School erupted resulted in the Mandela house being set alight while members of the community apparently just looked on, something had to be done to avert a full-blown crisis and the Crisis Committee which was comprised of MDM members was set up to tackle the problem in August of 1988 and there has been full evidence from the Crisis Committee on the activities.  \n Now I must emphasise that I am unable to give any direct evidence relating to the events around the Mandela home during the period in question, but my information came from several sources.  Firstly my capacity as national treasurer of the UDF, I had access to information from activists in Soweto.  Secondly as a partner in the law firm, Cheadle, Thompson and Haysom which at the time acted form the Methodist Church, I became intimately involved in the matter.  I had access to virtually all the material documents including key statements and affidavits.  My partner Fink Haysom and I spent many hours debating the appropriate responses to the crises.  I personally consulted with and represented Paul Verryn.\n My third source of information is that I interacted with MDM leaders constantly at this period.  One such person would have been Sydney Mufamadi.  There were certain objective facts around this case and there has been a lot of evidence over the last four days but to our mind at the time, and I'm not talking about hindsight, at the time there were certain in our view objective facts.  \n Firstly that four males including Stompie were forcibly removed from the Mans to the Mandela home.  Secondly they were viciously beaten at the Mandela home where they were kept against their will. Third, one young man Kenneth Kgase had escaped 7 January and reported his ordeal. Four, Stompie was not only tortured at the house, but then subsequently murdered in a savage fashion.  At best for Mrs Mandela Chairperson, at best for Mrs Mandela, she was aware and encouraged  this criminal activity.  At worst she directed it and actively participated in the assaults. Six, Paul Verryn was framed and seven, all reasonable efforts by the Church community leaders, Mr  Mandela, President Oliver Tambo to disband the gang of thugs by trying to secure Mrs  Mandela's co-operation had failed.\n By the 15th of February 1989 we were really at the end of our tether.  The principal resolutions of the 16th of January had not been implemented a month later and let us just remind ourselves what those resolutions were.  I was not part of the meeting.  I did not participate in it and I did not engineer any of the resolutions, but this is what the meeting said.  That when you be approached and be instructed to produce Stompie, that all progressive organisations should no longer give her a platform, that the Football Club be dismantled forthwith lest the community dismantle the Club for her.  That from henceforth she must desist from creating the impression that she speaks on behalf of the people.  That neither Krish Naidoo nor any other progressive lawyer in the country should act for her.  I'm personally uncomfortable with that fifth resolution because I think all human beings, irrespective of what crimes they may have been suspected of should have the best possible legal representative, but that is the decision that that community took.\n Now the Crisis Committee, and it is clear from the evidence as well that the Crisis Committee had become ineffective in the face of Mrs Mandela's obstinacy.  Stompie's body had been positively identified and our worst fears had now materialised.  The community anger was at boiling point.  Chairperson let me just stop for a moment and explain this boiling point.  The UDF had consistently over that period campaigned for the release of children.  They consistently campaigned around the brutalisation around the children in the townships.  We had gone, the DBSC had sent a delegation outside to Harare to tell the international community what was happening to the children.  So it was an extremely sensitive thing, forget the around this thing.  When I was released in detention in 1986, one of the first cases I was involved in was a case called State v Mahajane, where I tried unsuccessfully to secure the release of a 13 year old detainee.  We lost the case.  I was sickened by the judge, I was sickened by the courts.  What possible threat could a 13 year old be to the state, but that was the climate and that was the sensitivity.  And when I had approached, when I brought my own thinking to bear upon the decision we took, my professional life, my personal life and my political life came together.  I couldn't separate that.  \n So as the national leadership of the UDF then we realised that we had to do something and we decided to publicly distance ourselves from Mrs Mandela's actions.  And again I must emphasise we had very serious fears.  We were not sure whether people were going to march in the community on the Mandela home.  We were not sure whether the Daliwonga episode was going to repeat itself.  The situation was hot.  We weren't sitting calmly in some corner and playing political games and plotting, what do we do, who do we isolate, who do we integrate, that wasn't happening.  It was hot.  And that is the context that we are trying to explain here.\n I must say that for me it was one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made, but I think it was also one of the proudest moments that I can remember.  As time went on I have often over the last years, nine years had cause to reflect on that decision.  I hope that if I am ever confronted with having to make a similar decision that I will have the moral courage to do it again.  \n Unfortunately upon President Mandela's release from prison for Mrs Mandela the time had come to settle old scores.  She telephoned me one evening at my law firm after I had presided over a press conference at which Mr Mandela was present. She warned me to stay away from Mandela.  I wasn't able to pursue the conversation with here because the phone was put down on me.  \n Chairperson in concluding my statement, I would really want to make an earnest appeal to this Commission because this doesn't affect Mrs Mandela.  This affects us and it affects our future in the democracy in this country and in finalising this Commission's, in finalising it's recommendations, I think it should very seriously consider making a recommendation to the effect that anyone who has been convicted of having committed a criminal offence which amounts to a gross violation of a person's human rights should not be regarded as fit to hold public office.",

            "Chairperson and honourable Commissioners, to the extent that I got to know about some of the issues that were raised in your invitation in respect of which I was asked to appear before this Commission, I should mention that our primary source from and MDM perspective at the time was the Crisis Committee that had been constituted by leading members of the community resident in Soweto to try and help in what was clearly being experienced as a major crises affecting not only the Mandela family but also the broader Soweto community.  At the time when many of the events under consideration by the Commission and the sitting were taking place I was either in prison or overseas.  In June of 1987 together with Mohammed Valli Moosa was I was then the acting general secretary of the UDF.  We were detained by the security police in terms of the then prevailing general state of emergency.  I was at the time the acting publicity secretary of the United Democratic Front because as you know that the key leadership of our organisation were at that time facing charges for high treason.  It should however be recalled that that was a period characterised as my colleague Cachalia has mentioned earlier by heightened struggles against the then National Party government, which in response had also unleashed a ferocious counter campaign against the Mass Democratic Movement and many of our key activists were in detention at the time.  Our organisations which were an important source of stability for our community was generally restricted in terms of the state of emergency and most of the community leaders who were not in jail had been slapped with restrictions on their political and other activities in terms of the state of emergencies and I might add here that those who were not restricted, like Reverend Chikane were either poisoned or almost killed out of detention.  Thus making communication and effective involvement at all levels and at all times difficult and at times impossible.\n After a brief detention spell at St Albans Prison in Port Elizabeth in 1987, myself and Mohammed Valli were then transferred to Diepkloof Prison in Johannesburg where we were incarcerated until our escape from prison in 1988.  It was indeed while I was still in Diepkloof Prison that I first began to hear reports about the activities of the Mandela United Football Club.  Here I'm talking about the adverse reports that are a subject of this inquiry.  \n Of course, having been involved myself in youth activities myself from the early '70's, this initiative of a Football Club appeared to me as an initiative to be welcomed.  I come from Orlando East, the home of Orlando Pirates and football is just part and parcel of our existence.  So it is understandable. However amongst some of us in prison at the time serious reservations were being expressed about whether the Mandela United Football Club will be able to maintain a direction.  And here I'm talking about a direction which essentially is one which that would be seen to want to inculcate a particular demeanour among young people in our townships at the time.   I'm raising this because at the time of the state of emergency Chairperson, in our prisons where I was in Diepkloof there were hundreds of us and many of them were 13 year olds, 14 year olds, 15 year olds.  Many of them were just picked up in the streets and dumped into prisons with us.  Now the key question for us, especially those who were senior comrades as we were called in prison was what do we do with those young people in prison with us because we knew that idleness in a prison situation is very dangerous.  And then we actually went about creating an environment where we could have political classes where you could at least try to inculcate one kind of political perspective for them to appreciate their situation.  At least that was the least we could do and contribute toward ensuring that our environment in prison does not continue to contribute to what was what we believed was precisely the intention of the state that demoralisation of our youth and eventually in fact the subjugation of our people according to the dictates of the regime.  This anxiety was indeed heightened later on when about June or July, I think it was July but it doesn't matter, I think the Commission has a record of the actual date in 1988 when we received the disturbing reports in prison of the attack by pupils of Daliwonga High School on the Mandela residence in Soweto.  After our escape from prison, that is in September of 1988, our preoccupation continued to be about what it was to pull our structure together giving the debilitating effect of the state of emergency.  Even our escape if you are to think of it, was premised upon an approach that sought to execute actions that would begin to challenge the State of Emergency and eventually lead to its collapse.  \n As you'd know subsequent to that escape there were several hunger strikes that took place in prison where people demanded to be released and which eventually as you would recall, led in fact to the events in '89 and subsequent years.  A few weeks after our escape myself and Vally went overseas to visit a number of the anti-apartheid groups and individuals who had supported us during the struggle. For 1989 our major concern as we were looking at then was about how to get the major campaigns of the Mass Democratic Movement, like the Defiance Campaign which we launched then and this trouble took us the most part of December '88 and January 1989.  And while we're overseas, now the importance of what I'm telling Chairperson is that I am a living soul in this environment, I'm actually, I wasn't a politician. I was an activist, I wasn't being paid for doing the things that I was doing. It was a commitment of the struggle.  Now even as we're going about doing what we're doing, we constantly tried to keep in touch with what was happening and the point here is that my interface with the events surrounding the Stompie Seipei case and others was not something that happened when I landed at Jan Smuts Airport towards the end of January.  It was something that I was interfacing with that was impacting as well on my own thinking about these issues and we continued then to get reports about the goings on of the Mandela United Football Club and by that time the major story was about the abductions and brutal assaults on some youths in the Mandela homestead.  Pardon the spelling error there, and when we returned to the country towards the end of January 1989 we found, and certainly I going to my home in Orlando East, found the air in Soweto thick with the tension arising from the recent events surrounding the death in fact of Stompie.\n Now you might ask how do I get to know that the air is thick with this tension.  I grew up in the township, I was born in Orlando East.  In the 1970's as a secondary school student, Soweto was infested with gangsterism.  Any township you knew there were gangsters there and it did not need to be a rocket scientist to know when there's tension where people live with fear, you could discern it, it becomes palpable, especially if you are part of that environment. And form the reports which we received from members of the Crisis  Committee, we were left in no doubt that unless a quick and decisive political intervention was made the likelihood between a conflagration between at least the Soweto Youth Congress members and members of the Football Club was increasingly becoming a real possibility.  The organised youth formations, labour and civic organisation, were in fact at a point where they actually were at the end of their tether regarding their reign of terror that residents were subjected to by what had increasingly become an undisciplined group of youngsters who were surrounding Mrs Madikizela-Mandela at the time.  \n Apart from the moral repugnance with which some of us recoiled at the activities of what people in the township tended to generally regard as Winnie's boys, one of our major concerns at a political level was the extent to which the activities of these boys were beginning to detract ... acting the regime and remember I said that one was and activist. It is important to understand how these things impact on us when we consider what our strategic objective as an organisation and as a movement actually is.  Our agitation increased with each report from the Crisis Committee.  We suggested growing recalcitrance on the part of Mrs Madikizela Mandela and disdainful treatment of the Crisis Committee who it must be mentioned had as one of the items on the agenda, apart from the rescue of the boys or the release of the boys that were kept there, the desire to rescue her from behaviour which was increasingly exposing not only her but the entire movement from the machination of what was clearly National Security Management System operations, but Chairperson as the Commission would also have heard from the members of the Crisis Committee, she refused to heed even advice from Oliver Tambo and Comrade Nelson Mandela.  \n It is not Chairperson my intention to repeat what members of that Crisis Committee would have submitted to you as it is now a matter of public record, which was essentially the feedback we were getting at the time. Suffice it to say that our attitude in the Mass Democratic movement had, apart from their reports, the increasingly belligerent sounds from the community of Soweto and the desperate calls for leadership to take it's stand on this matter.  That was the basis for our subsequent action.\n It was thus in that context that on the 16th of February 1989 we called for a press conference under the auspices of the Mass Democratic Movement whereat we issued a public statement on the matter of Mrs Madikizela Mandela and her Football Club.  I think it's also important for one to pause, just to give the Commission a sense of what this Mass Democratic Movement was.  At that time with all the bannings and detentions, our organisations were getting significantly affected by that and it was clear that operating in a normal situation was not possible and we than had to find various ways of operating to a point that most of the meetings, those that we managed to conduct, they had to be conducted in a secret manner as possible and I think from the evidence that has been led here, even in terms of the Dobsonville meeting of January that year, it was clear that there was a sense of uncertainty and fear in meetings whenever people that were not necessarily part of the original organisation appeared.  There was a sense of fear, there was a sense of anticipation of possibly system involvement. Now for the Mass Democratic Movement then I acted as myself from my original position as the spokes person of the United Democratic Front, continued to play that role even for what we then called the Mass Democratic Movement.  \n In one of the statements and comments I made at the time, when we ask about what is the Mass Democratic Movement, what is going to happen with the UDF and the argument we put was that the UDF might be banned but what the UDF stands for will be continue and we're able to continue operating as a Mass Democratic Movement, we're a fairly loose conglomerate of groupings, essentially made up of United Democratic Front entities and the Trade Union Movement through COSATU, and where then at the leadership level to have significant interaction such that even as we are coming up with a statement on the 16th of February, which by the way was not very long after the confirmation of the body of a young person as being that of the body of Stompie Seipei and that is the tension that began to increase in the township.  By the time we came up with a statement it was clear to us that if we do not make an act and act decisively at that point in time, we are going to be faced with a situation in the township that will be beyond our control because at that point in time, that issue of the meeting and the resolutions of the Dobsonville meeting came up.  Have they been applied, have they been implemented?  People continued what they perceived to be still the Mandela United Football Club around Mrs Winnie Mandela at the time and this confirmation of Stompie's death actually added fire to the fuel and the other way around.\n It is then Chairperson with that in mind that you would actually see the pressure and the tension that was surrounding us at the time in terms of what do we do as a Mass Democratic Movement about this issue.  Now when I listened to the testimonies of the Crisis Committee and that of the Reverend Peter Storey, you know you had the sense because I was not keeping a diary, one of the best things we had to do in case we got caught was to try to forget as much as what you are doing, so I wasn't keeping a diary but of course the Reverend Peter Storey's a priest, he wasn't on the run, he was leading a normal life and he had the benefit of keeping notes of what he was doing.  They might not be accurate in a number of respects but certainly there's a certain sense of what you get of the atmosphere at the time when you go through the sequential recording of what was happening around these issues, that was really the way in which things impacted on you.  \n My Comrades from the Crisis Committee I can understand, I mean it is a situation from where you try to recollect as much as you can because information was not generally recorded because as it was indicated earlier on, in 1989 there was no concept of a Truth Commission in 1997.

            "Yes, okay, no I just thought Chairperson ...(indistinct) what was going on my mind at the time.\n We then went about dealing with this statement because this statement is the major intervention that the Mass Democratic Movement made on this issue.  Now as you would sense from the statement, the statement had been actually cast in such a way that it was clear that there was a number things that we were uncertain.  There were certain common threats even amongst the issues and the reports that we were getting. One of which was the element that we referred to in the statement relating to what we referred to as the obvious complicity of Mrs Mandela with respect to say the disappearance and even the subsequent death of Stompie Seipei.  Now it's a statement that took us many hours to construct.  In fact to be precise, over six hours it took us to actually get to a point where it became more or less a reasonable statement that would not even go to a point of levelling the accusation that the individual who is the subject of the statement  is by definition guilty of what we actually say is the reason for us making this statement. \n So the point about this statement Chairperson is that this was a statement that we hope with its being put into the system would help in stemming the tide of what we began to see as an explosive situation in Soweto and I'm sure that people that were observers at the time would actually take note of the fact that there was a degree to which it had a desired effect because certainly, here was a statement that said, irrespective of who you are in the organisation and in the liberation movement, it is important that we become uncompromising against issues relating to violations of human rights because it is precisely because we are fighting against that from the system that some of us went to jail, some of us were tortured in jail and it was therefore important that we shouldn't get to a situation where we condoned these activities and perhaps one might say, as you would know Bishop, that in some ways God works in mysterious ways.  That certain things would then happen in order to present you with opportunities to make certain decisions that you cannot necessarily plan for in advance.  It happened that this was the case involving Mrs Madikizela Mandela and at that time for us the question was not whether, who she was, it was a question of what lay behind the decision that we made.\n Thank you Chairperson.",

Just to complete then Chairperson, for me personally they issue here is that this process is important for me because this statement has had a profound effect for me as an individual on my relationship with Mrs Madikizela Mandela who I'd come to know from a very early age in the early '70's.  In fact it could be said I actually grew up under her.  And in fact it has an effect on me in terms of my relationship with here and with many others inside and outside of the movement, who, given the proximity or otherwise to the intensity of the events being investigated by the TRC, who would at the time and perhaps even now still have taken positions one way or the other.  I'm saying this because if you stayed in Orlando West you would have one sense of these issues, and perhaps an even more intensive sense of what was happening around the Football Club.  If you stayed in Zola or in Meadowlands perhaps you would experience events like Mr Sono experienced there, you know intermittent forays into your area.  And if you stayed very in Bisho or you know in Pampierstad, these events should be very remote from you and I think those of us who were right in the situation had the level of intensity.\n Now the point I'm making in conclusion is that what I got involved in as  Murphy Morobe had nothing to do with a personal vendetta I have against  Mrs Mandela, I think there were issues of principle here that for me it was important that my organisation, my movement begin to confront upfront.

            "Well for me one of the things - incidentally I spent time on Robben Island and one of the inmates on Robben Island was Comrade Nelson Mandela from whom many of us as young people learnt many things, and in a number of debates and discussions that we had on the island one of the issues that we actually spent a lot of time on related to the whole question of cults, the cult of the individual, the cult of personality, I think those who have read the histories of the world would know about those events in various countries where powerful figures where they design, and even in fact they desire and even in fact acquire reverence from in fact subjects become so powerful especially when they are not being questioned that in the end they begin to work against the interests of the very people who are giving them in fact their power.  So the question here for me even when I was doing the statement it was a reflection of all those things that I learned and what do I do with the situation, I mean I am faced with someone as I say as a young student at Morris Isaacson on my way from school, one of my routes took me past her home in Orlando West, sometimes I will stop over, sometimes she will give me tea.   In 1976 the Archbishop was in Soweto, Mrs Mandela's house was burnt and I was one of those that came to the house to actually offer that support at the time.\n Now 1989 presents us with certain sets of circumstances and I am a grown up person, I have developed in terms of my mind, I understand a little better about these things and one of the things I have come to understand is the whole question of power relations in any environment where you as an individual have to relate to someone else.  In the situation of the Football Club I think psychologists or social theoreticians will be very interested to make a thorough study of the dynamics that take place in that kind of environment where we have people that come from different places that do not have power, that do not have money, in fact that need some support and in their relationship to individuals that are powerful, have got all the means, and in that situation it becomes important to even understand the behaviour of those individuals when they have to relate in that situation.  Now it might be said to be theoretical, of course I stand to be criticised and even perhaps crushed on the ground, but at least that's my view and that's how I understand these issues.\n And for me I was faced in 1989 with the situation of saying, do I subject what I think at that point in time had reached a point where we need to take a principled position or do we say well you know somebody, it's one of us, it's wrong, and we might quote other instances and say why didn't you do something about the whole range of incidents all over the country, but I think that's another matter, but the point is that on this particular issue we took a particular view and I think that view, in my mind, you know is still reflected in the statement which I think is still valid.",

But having said that there were people who took sides on this thing and really it was a simple question, a very simple question.  People make political calculations, not only in South Africa, they make political calculations all over the world and if you were on the right side of Comrade Winnie, or the wrong side of Comrade Winnie, depending on where Comrade Winnie is in the structure, you took particular choices, and so, ja, in some ways it was a bit lonely because we had felt that, I had felt that a year after we had issued the statement in a sense some of the people were out for us, that there was a coolness, but having said that you know, as they say cowboys don't cry, you take stands like this and you mustn't cry about it.

            "On my part Chairperson this particular issue, when I talk about the effects clearly there is a definite way in which relationships have been affected here, you know, and it was bound to happen, it's by the very nature of the intervention.  Now one either takes it personally or one takes it politically and I chose to take it politically.  I have no individual or particular gripes against the person or any individual, I take the issue politically and for me I mean that's basically where I come from and up to thus far it hasn't affected me.  Sure I mean I know, I don't want to talk even about rumours etc because as you will see from my statement where I talk about undercurrents that's basically what it is people just don't come up, you can sense it, you know when people take particular positions and think that you know you are either not one of them because you take a particular view, for me it doesn't matter.  I think history called upon us to make a particular point and I think we made it.\n Now I think history once again will become the judge of whether we were right or we were not right, and I think that's why for me this Commission is important.  It must come up in those facts.  And for me it's also important that if we are wrong in what we did or said it will be incumbent upon us to take that and come up and say we were wrong and make the appropriate apology.  Now for me my eyes are on the Commission, that's why I am here to try to assist the Commission to get to the conclusion.",

            "I think that it seems sensible to say it would probably be better to call a halt to the proceedings for today at this point.  In an ideal world we would have wished to have completed the schedule that we had already set out for today but it isn't the case and I do want to apologise very deeply to people who have come and were ready to testify, Commissioner Fivaz, I think it would be, in fact irresponsible.  We are tired. I am a sick old man and so I can use that, I can't go on forever, these younger people might, so I suggest that we break and start, Mr Semenya you would start tomorrow morning.\n Thank you very much.  We resume at half past eight.\nHEARING ADJOURNS",
