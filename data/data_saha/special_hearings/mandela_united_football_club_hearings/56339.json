            "I wondered and even said this gun is not functioning.  We had to go back now.  We went back to get another gun.  We were looking for Botha at first.  We were in Zone 1, at the garage in Meadowlands.  We went to the hostel.  Fortunately we found Botha there with Kgase fixing the car.\n We left with him to a certain place there in Orlando.  I don't remember  quite well if it was Orlando and we got another gun.  We parked our car outside and Botha got inside for quite some time and he came out and told us that everything is fine and I have another gun now.  It was not as big as the other gun that we had at first.\n We got inside the car, we drove back and he dropped us at the bottle store and Swala left.  And we went back to that place.  It was around half past two or three, I am not quite too sure.  We got there, we got inside and the patients were no longer as many.  We only saw two ladies who were in a critical stage.\n Fortunately when we got inside, Mbatha went on, was told to go inside, to see the Doctor and I was waiting in the waiting room and suddenly I heard a gun shot, twice.  And the security door was locked.\n After some time Mbatha appeared next to the security door and suddenly I saw the security door opening.  I got inside myself to see as to what was happening.  I saw this gentleman laying down and we left the place.\n Outside we saw an ambulance and the lady who was working inside there, got outside and was screaming outside for help and we fled the scene.   They tried to chase us and Mbatha shot, shot right to the sky, a threatening shot and we ran and fled.\n And they tried to chase us, the ambulance men, but they could not catch up with us.  We got to as far as Diepkloof, it was around half past seven and we left for Mzamomhle.  We took Botha and went to the house where we would be given our money, our pay and we left.\n We parked our car outside and Swala got inside  and he was supposed to be getting inside to get some money as we have already carried the mission and he got outside to tell us that the lady was not inside.  And we started now complaining and said Botha, how can you do this to me.  Because we were supposed to be paid now, we have carried out the task but it is not appearing as if we will be paid and we (indistinct) we will go and come back the following day.\n We parted ways that evening.  I went to my accommodation to the place where I was staying.  The following day we planned that we will meet and go back again to claim our money.  And he insisted that we will get that money and we parted ways with Botha.\n The following day, the morning, after listening to the news, we found out that the police are in search of the people who killed the Doctor.  We left, I tried to hide and I came across another newspaper and saw a picture outside and my picture outside, that was a drawn picture.\n It was not my picture, quite well, there were some differences according to the picture that appeared on the newspaper.  There were incisions on my face, but very short incisions.  The difference in the identikit was that the incisions were longer, but what surprised me was that I saw my name and I got very scared at that stage when I saw my name and I decided not to walk around the streets during the day.\n I went to seek a hiding place.  I hid myself in that place.  I did not trust anyone and I was running away from the police as well as the rest and I refrained from moving around during the day, I only walked around during the night.\n I stayed for quite some time in that place and we lost each other with Mbatha and I did not know at that stage as to where Mbatha is.  I began not to trust Mbatha and I kept on hiding even from Mbatha himself.\n This went on for quite some time.  And we went to Kliptown, that is myself and Mbatha.  At that time the police were hot on our trail.  We went to Kliptown until late - round about half past six or seven o'clock and when we came back, looking for Botha, we just couldn't get hold of Botha because he had left.  We waited for quite some time in vain.\n Mbatha went his different way, I went my different way as well, because I did not want Mbatha to know as to where I stayed.  On a Sunday I went to (indistinct) and I stayed with another home boy of mine, who was a KwaZulu Natal policeman.  We stayed there, we had some drinks, alcoholic beverages.  I left him, I went out looking for my girlfriend.\n And she was not at her place, I was told that she had been arrested by the police.  And I realised that I was no longer safe.  I left the place as quick as I arrived because I did not want the police to arrest me.  A few days went by, let's just say that very same Sunday I went back to Diepkloof and when I got to Diepkloof I got wind that my brother had been taken away by the police.\n They said he should point out as to where I was.  I also ran away from there and I did not want to go to Mzamomhle.  I wanted to look for Botha so that I could get my money and get out of the scene.",

I will read you the questioning as well as the answer.\n On this occasion Mr Pigou was asking the questions.  Mrs Madikizela-Mandela, the transcript into the State versus Ikaneng case, the murder of Maxwell Modondo, one of the State witnesses only named as witness B, says that shortly after the murder of Modondo his body was moved across to the other side of the street by Sibusiso Chili and that when the body had been moved across there, while people was still standing around, he saw you in a vehicle looking at the scene at what was there.  This is may I remind you, a State witness against the murderers of Mr Modondo.  This sight of you in a vehicle is repeated by Mr Sibusiso Chili who was accused 6 in that case.  Were you at all present after the murder of Maxwell Modondo at the scene, did you see his body?  Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's response, that is absurd Mr Chairman.  I am sure you can spend a lifetime going through the court files, getting all sorts of versions of all sorts of things that was said about me, at all sorts of trials.\n Mr Pigou, no but the relevance of this particular viewing of yourself and testimony given under oath by Defence witness and a State witness is that you were there.  Mrs Madikizela-Mandela, that is absolute rubbish Mr Chairman.  Mr Pigou, thank you.  Mrs Madikizela-Mandela goes on, all sorts of versions were given under oath by the apartheid.  Mr Pigou, we are talking about this specific case, we are not talking - there are lots of interruptions -and then Mrs Madikizela-Mandela goes on, there is absolutely nothing new in what  you are telling me, it is absolute nonsense.\n Finally, and I ignore the interventions, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela ends of by saying I was nowhere near that scene, it is the first time I am hearing from you.\n So Mrs Madikizela-Mandela very strongly denies that she was on the scene, what is your response to her denial?",
