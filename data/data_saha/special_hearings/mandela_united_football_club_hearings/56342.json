It is a smoke free zone.  If you want to smoke, smoke outside of the building itself.  We would be most grateful if you could do that.\n I now call Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela to the witness stand.

Ma'am, we have heard over the past eight days, that in the past eight odd years, there have been rumours about your complicity in human right abuse cases.\n We have heard over the period that there have been smear campaigns associating you with these things.  We have heard about impressions which people have held about you in association with these human right abuses.  We have heard over the past eight days that over the eight years odd, there have been beliefs about your association in these things.  We have sat over the eight years, and listened to hearsay evidence linking you to these things.  \n We have over the past eight years, also had statements from deceased persons that seek to associate you with these human right violation cases.\n We have heard over the past eight years allegations which have been levelled against you.  We have also heard facts of assaults that have been inflicted on some of the victims.  We have also heard facts about the deaths of various people.  We have heard over the past eight days various conspiracies that have been wound up around these issues and we have seen over the past eight days, even newspaper headlines, today being the last day of the hearing, that you are a police informer.  \n I think the rest of the country and the world perhaps, has waited for an opportunity that you meet all these allegations and I hope to take you through various aspects of it.  My professional judgement though is that we may not be able to meet each and every such allegation and or rumour and meet it adequately, but it would be incumbent on us to address main areas that have arisen during the past eight days.\n Can I then draw your attention to the first area which is the four young men who were staying at the Methodist manse.

That his father begged you to leave him there? That in fact you merely went to fetch him from his father's house, and dropped him off at Jerry Richardson's house?   Is that still your position?",

The first statement I will read to you is the statement made by Major Moodley when he went to the United Kingdom to interview Mr Cebekhulu.  In the statement he says, I am reading paragraph 4.1,  halfway in that paragraph it says,\n\"Morgan and Winnie went, when two persons unknown to him came into the house and spoke to Winnie. He was then told by Winnie to take the two people and show them Dr Asvat's house.  He then accompanied these to Black males in their motor car and pointed out the house where Dr Asvat was.  They then brought him back to Winnie's house and left him there and went away.\"\nThat is just the first statement.  This statement is then Mr Cebekhulu's statement and he says in paragraph 11,  \"Mrs ...\",  sorry,\n\"He took two young men, two young men came to see Mrs Mandela in her home one evening.  Mrs Mandela had called me and instructed me to drive with them and show them where Dr Asvat's surgery was and in which street. I showed them the surgery.\"\nThe next sentence says,\n\"I had not seen these men in Mrs Mandela's house before, nor had I met them in any other place though neither of them had any family or other connection with myself of which I was aware.\"\nAnd then just the third statement is from Mr Tulani, Dlamini Tulani, ag, Tulani Dlamini, sorry, and he says here,\n\"She called a child and said that the child must call Katiza.  The child went out and a while later Katiza came into the room.  Winnie then spoke to him and said to him to show these people the person and the place in Rockville.\"\nAll these statements that I have read, basically, they all confirm one thing, that neither Mr Dlamini nor Mr Mbatha nor Mr Cebekhulu ever knew each other before you asked Mr Cebekhulu to show these people, Mr Dlamini and Mr Mbatha, where Dr Asvat's surgery was.

            "Mrs Madikizela-Mandela, before I begin, I think I want to preface what I am going to say with just a comment that I think all of us here remember what you have done, we appreciate where you come from and for many of us you were, in fact, one of the heroines of the struggle, but I sat through eight days of evidence and I think today, for me, was particularly painful and that is because I have heard the evidence and, from it, I think, some of the lines I can actually draw from the evidence is that, through your own sense of social responsibility, you gave shelter to homeless and, of course, particularly displaced youth, a football club was formed and by your own version, you, in fact, disbanded the football club on the instructions of your then husband.  The youths, however, continued to wear the uniform and, of course, basked in the aura of the Mandela name and the perception out there, therefore, in the community, was that the football club had not been disbanded.  From your own evidence, they accompanied you wearing football uniforms, even to the funeral of Dr Asvat in 1989 and I have heard your explanation today that those were the best clothes that they owned.\n Some of the youngsters who have come to give evidence did not stay with you, but many of them frequented the property and I concede that even those who did not stay with you, that there may be, amongst them, those who have been convicted of criminal activity.  Of course, we have amnesty applications for some of them, but when the Crisis Committee wrote the statement that they did and when they made their submission in paragraph 19 they say that they insisted on removing what they considered a bush around you, namely the Mandela United Football Club and I think that one can assume that the credibility of those persons, even then, was not questioned and they sought to inform you and warn you that you were surrounding yourself with persons of questionable character.  In fact, you yourself, during these hearings, have labelled the people who were associated with you quite closely, you have said that their evidence was ludicrous and ridiculous, but the suggestion of the Committee, in their own words, was met with a negative, a firm negative response from both yourself and the club members and in terms of their own report, despite their communications, despite the communication of the MDM and Oliver Tambo, you, in fact, refused to disassociate yourself from the club, but in today's hearing you say, also, that you are surprised at the fact that the father of one of the victims, Mr Sono, has joined, and I think you ruthlessly called it the charade that is taking place.  You call the report of the Crisis Committee exaggerated and distorted, you implied today that the MDM members who testified have an agenda, they had an agenda then and they have an agenda now and, in fact, in the Section 29 inquiry, you referred to their reports as Stratcom operations.  Now, I have a difficulty with that and I really have tried to understand why are you seeking to discredit people who I think honestly tried to come and give evidence.  I think for me that is a problem.  \nThe second question I want to put to you is that however you perceive the situation, these were youngsters who congregated around you.  You, in fact, took them along with you to many functions.  Do you not accept that you have to bear some kind of responsibility for their actions.  They, in fact, regarded you as their leader, their head of household and my question is what did you, in fact, do to control them or to make them accountable, because if your evidence is to be believed today, then everybody else who testified at this hearing is lying and, I am sorry, I have a problem, because I would like to believe that part of what we are trying to do is to establish accountability.  Now, you can say I am a non-South African, because that is what you said to me in the Section 29 hearing.",

As far as I am concerned the two youths who claim that I gave them money to kill Dr Asvat were lying.  As far as I am concerned Morgan's ludicrous statements made before you here are a pack of lies.  I can go on and on and on.  You are saying I am seeking to discredit people who were out to assist me.  They testified here, they drew reports, sent them to Lusaka without my knowledge, sent people to Victor Verster without my knowledge and the reports that were sent to Victor Verster were of a nature which affected the family to this day.  Reports which were based on untested information.\n You are saying people who wanted to assist me, are being discredited here.  In that regard I should imagine you are referring to the MDM statement by Adzar Cachalia and Murphy Morobe, who made a recommendation here.\n Adzar Cachalia who made that recommendation in his very last sentence, delivering that kind of sensational statement before this forum, you had a problem with that when I regarded such people who issued such statements, during those times.  You regard me as discrediting them.  I am an ordinary human being, they did things to me which were not acceptable.  It is not true that I totally refused to have the boys removed from my premises.  I have led evidence here to the effect that even though suggestions were made, that the boys must be placed elsewhere, that did not actually happen.  That process did not actually happen.   It was not as if they came with accommodation arrangements, which I totally rejected.\n You are talking about those painful times, you are talking about a society which was abnormal at the time, and things happened to those of us who were in the front line in the struggle.  Yes, I protected those children and continued doing so.  I let them wear those uniforms, yes, with hindsight, I should have taken the uniforms.\nBut my instinct of protecting the children during those times, when many South Africans were sitting comfortable in their houses whilst we fought a just struggle, it was during those times that these things happened.  You have a problem because the things, the fabrications that have been made here, are regarded by me as lies.  Yes, they are.\n Richardson could not be speaking the truth, you know that.  Morgan couldn't possibly be speaking the truth.  Those boys couldn't possibly be speaking the truth that I hired them to kill a close friend of mine.  I regard it as very tragic that you have to this day those perceptions about why certain people, some of them who were close to me, distanced themselves in certain circumstances.

            "Thank you Chairman.  I guess I should have a sense of what it should feel like to be falsely implicated in atrocities and then the consequently I use that as my point of departure to assess all the evidence to date.\n And I think Dr Boraine has painted what I would have put to you as the best case scenario.  That your perception is that you are a victim of a huge plot by the government security forces because on their own evidence, they came here and they admitted having infiltrated informers into your household, that they organised a huge campaign to discredit you and your organisation and possibly your husband as he then was.\n But in the midst of all this (indistinct) web of deceit, treachery and betrayal you are possibly all by yourself, harassed by the State machinery and not having any benefit of political support from structures that were in existence at that time and you would like us to understand that to be the necessary backdrop against which all these things were happening, that if there is any error it was an error of judgement on your part in not having been able to realise the type of people who were around you, and that the tragedies that followed were consequence thereof.\n That is where I want to depart from because for me it is the best case scenario.  Of course there is a worse case scenario and I think my colleagues have endeavoured to say the worse case scenario where we say why do all these people say all of these things, and you have indicated that you are going to address that in your reply to Dr Mgojo and therefore to all of us.\n I am just worried about one aspect and that is the death of Stompie.  We have two versions.  I want to tell you now that my impressions which are prima facie impressions are that when you look at the evidence of Katiza Cebekhulu, when it stands alone, it suffers from a number of deficiencies.  I wouldn't go so far as to call it as lunatic statements, but then you hold that view.\n But just on the quality level, one is able to say it has certain deficiencies.  He is the only witness who claims to have been an eyewitness to the stabbing of Stompie, as he puts it.  There is of course the evidence of Jerry Richardson.\n But Katiza Cebekhulu's evidence stands alongside the evidence of John Morgan.   And his evidence seems to suggest that there was a time when he was ordered to beat this dog and go and dispose of it and of course he says the dog was Stompie and where he saw the dog to be laying, he seems to suggest that it was bleeding from the neck.\n There is then the Pathologist's evidence which seems to say his findings are inconsistent with the slaughtering of a sheep, which would then lead me where I have to conclude that there is a consistency between what Cebekhulu says and Morgan says and the suggestion by the Pathologist.\n Now that is an impression that I want to take into account.  I also take into account Richardson's evidence.  Now, I know that your lawyer will address, because sometimes this is a matter of law, but if you were as a person who has heard all of these things, were to endeavour to persuade me, what would you say in order that I should accept Richardson's account of how Stompie died and that I should reject what Cebekhulu says, what John Morgan says and the inference I can draw from the Pathologist's report?",

We want to commend especially speaking of South African media, the TV Special Report and the radio team who have done splendidly.\n We thank the print media and we are glad for all the foreign journalists who have come so that the world can know of the process here.

We have already expressed our appreciation to them when they came here.\n Thank you to the caterers, thank you to the briefers, thank you to the translators, to the technical staff who have enabled all of this to happen.

We live in the same street in what is sometimes called Beverley Hills, our children went to the same school in Swaziland.  They call me uncle and so on.\n Mrs Madikizela-Mandela is godmother to one of our grandchildren, who was baptised on the Sunday of Madiba's release.  When I bishop of Lesotho I used to visit Mrs Madikizela-Mandela well maybe once or twice in Brandfort.  I have immense admiration for her and there is no question at all that she was a tremendous stalwart of our struggle, an icon of liberation who was banned, harassed, under surveillance, banished, with her husband away serving a life sentence, she had to bring up two young girls.\n We can never forget her outstanding contribution to the struggle and her indomitable spirit.  Everything was done to seek to break that spirit and she was an incredible inspiration to many and her contribution to the struggle can never be again said, she was the most apt representative for her husband.\n We struggled to establish a new, a different dispensation characterised by new morality, where integrity, truthfulness, (indistinct), accountability etc, were the order of the day.  We say that crime currently, domestic violence, not caring for our environment, corruption, selfishness etc, which are prevalent are there because we need the antidote of a new moral order, a respect for authority etc.\n Some of us were devastated, it also found it exhilarating what happened during this hearing.  Devastated by the performance of some eminent leaders of the struggle.  The moral (indistinct) that came from them, was unexpected and shattering.  There were splendid exceptions who stood out in stark contrast, Adzar Cachalia, Murphy Morobe, the two Methodist bishops, Sydney Mufamadi.\n And  at the time I was deeply, deeply distressed after Mrs Sisulu's testimony and I can say that I am now in a sense over the moon over what has happened to rehabilitate someone I hold in the highest possible regard.  There have been extraordinarily moving moments such as Bishop Verryn's (indistinct) to Mrs Seipei and then to Mrs Madikizela-Mandela.\n We need to demonstrate that qualitatively this new dispensation is different, qualitatively morally, that we need to stand up to be counted for goodness, for truth, for compassion and not (indistinct) to the powerful.\n I acknowledge Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's role in the history of our struggle and yet one has to say that something went wrong, horribly, badly wrong.  What, I don't know.\n None of us can ever be able to predict for you have to keep saying, there but for the grace of God, go I.  Something wrong, such that many leaders had to be involved in seeking to deal with a particular problem.\n It was marvellous seeing Winnie as she walked hand in hand with her husband then, leaving the Victor Verster prison.  It was wonderful seeing them walk together on the lawn of Bishop's Court on the day after his release.  I was one of the church leaders who was asked to come and speak to you.\n I came all the way from Cape Town.  I don't know that we will ever know all the details of what it is that went wrong.  Many, many love you.  Many, many say you should have been where you ought to be, the first lady of this country.  What was I going to say to you had we had this meeting as a church leader, because when I came and we tried to have the meeting, it was impossible to have the meeting for you were not able to see us, you were studying you said at Wits.\n This is what I would have said to you, this is what I want to say to you.  I speak to you as someone who loves you very deeply.  Who loves your family very deeply.  I would have said to you, let us have a public meeting.  And at that public meeting for you to stand up and say there are things that went wrong, there are things that went wrong and I don't know why they went wrong.\n There are people out there who want to embrace you.  I still embrace you because I love you and I love you very deeply.  There are many out there who would have wanted to do so if you were able to bring yourself to say something went wrong.\n Because all these leaders couldn't have been so agitated and say I am sorry.  I am sorry for my part in what went wrong and I believe we are incredible people.  Many would have rushed out in their eagerness to forgive and to embrace you.\n I beg you, I beg you, I beg you please - I have not made any particular finding from what has happened here.  I speak as someone who has lived in this community.  You are a great person and you don't know how your greatness would be enhanced if you were to say sorry, things went wrong, forgive me.
