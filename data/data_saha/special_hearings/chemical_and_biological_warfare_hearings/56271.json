            "No, no, I hear you what you say Doctor Basson.  I mention it to you because my recollection is that is what General Knobel had told us.  When he was confronted with this unique situation regarding the CD's he said that he had to rely on what you had told him and you couldn't blame him that he had to rely on people who needed to assist him and he still mentioned the examples of the case of Mr PW Botha's report which was not personally read by the Chairperson of the Commission, so that is why I'm asking you.  So you say you never told him formally told him: \"Look, this was completed successfully\"?",

            "Advocate, I don't want to repeat the argument, I don't want to repeat it Chairperson, and members because we handled it this morning to a great extent.  If I understand the attitude of Mr Vally correctly, he said that he does not have a problem with the second part of the application which is that the record should not be distributed to other people, other than those who really need it, for yourselves that is.\n His objection was against the first part, the in camera bit.  That was his objection.  So I am not going to waste your time any further unless you really want to hear from me with regards to the aspect of the making available thereof, for example to the office of the Attorney General or the Police who is handling the case or people who's got nothing to do with this case.  I will limit myself to the in camera bit of the application, the first bit of the application.\n I have already referred to page 33 of the law which gives you the capacity or the ability and you had insight into the statement of Ntsebeza, where he gave support to the counter application which was handed in earlier this week in the High Supreme court and he utters this as one of the things which the law assists the Committee with, to protect the right to silence or the infringement thereof.  To make the infringement thereof lighter.\n And also say that it is so important for your report that you hear the evidence and that you can deal with this properly and you can still protect his rights for example to have the hearing in camera.  My submission is, I was not involved in the application, but my instructions are that it was also the basis of the argument of the Advocate who acted on behalf of the Committee at that aspect, it is with regards to the protection measures which are there and which lightens the infringement of the right to silence.\n In the light of the protection of Section 33 and 31, this balance is that the public interest must gain priority, but Mr Vally now informs you that we are now at a situation where all the aspects which you want to know from Dr Basson, and these are the aspects he is specifically going to be charged with.\n So that is going to be very prejudicial to him if it is disclosed or if it is going to become to the knowledge of the people who is going to prosecute him.  I have already addressed you more properly about your right to silence, and there is a specific law in Section 35 of the constitution, the prejudicial aspect thereof.\n I refer you to that.  I also refer to Havenga which said that the disadvantage lies in the fact that you cannot force a person to show his hand before the time, and I am not going to waste your time any further.  You know everything about those aspects.\n But now we are in a situation, and we have now reached the stage where each thing Dr Basson is going to be asked about by Mr Vally, are aspects which are contained in the charge sheet and it is very relevant to the charge sheet and he is going to be prejudiced by giving answers now which is given in public and necessarily it is also going to come to the knowledge of the people who are going to prosecute him.\n It is naive to say by Mr Vally, that those people would not irresponsibly handle that.  Surely you know that about the prosecution of Mr Nkabinde in Natal where they went so far as to in this time with the constitution in place, that person went and placed microphones or bugs in his cell to listen to the consultations he had with his Attorneys, so to rely on the responsibility of the Police only, is not a sufficient guarantee for the protection of the right to silence of Dr Basson.\n Dr Basson is prepared to answer you with regards to all the questions which are put to him legitimately in terms of the court findings.  He has not given me any instruction to the extent that he does not want to adhere to that court order, that is why - or answer the questions this morning, but with the greatest respect, the moment when you, or let me rather put it this way, that obligation is only towards you and the responsible people, and that does not extent to the general public where it will be disadvantageous to him.\n My respectful submission is here that once again you've got to weigh the important things here.  On the one hand you have to consider the right of silence and on the other hand you have to think of the public interest.  The importance of the public interest is contained in the documents before the Judge Hlophe.\n It was handled on the basis of the public interest and you as the Committee, you expire today so it is very important for you as a Committee to obtain answers to questions with regards to Project Coast and therefore we have to infringe the right to silence and that is why Justice Hlophe gave his judgment.\n But with the greatest respect, a case was never put as a basis, neither in these documents nor in the argument of Mr Hlophe.  But his rights are of such a nature that the rights of Mr Basson must be destroyed in order to satisfy the public's inquisitiveness, because if that was the basis to intervene into a person's basic rights, then there would not be place in our law for the existence of a right to silence because public curiosity would always be there.\n In a lot of cases, its got to gain priority above the person's right to silence and with all respect, there would be no place in our law to the right of silence.  Therefore it is my respectful submission that at this stage of this whole affair, you would find a midway by destroying Dr Basson's right to silence, but also to protect him as best as you could.\n The law provides for this.  That is protection in terms of Section 31 and also in terms of Section 33.  I cannot understand the basis of the opposition of my colleagues against such a request if you consider the prejudice.\n As far as Mr Vally's attitude is concerned, and specifically with regards to the fact that he does not have a problem that you make an order that the record is not distributed, but he does have a problem with the in camera hearing.\n The problem I've got with that is the one is destructive, because if the proceedings do take place in public, what does that help if you then make an order that the minutes are not distributed?  All the media, all the people in the public heard what was said, all representatives heard what was said.  I do not know if there are people in this audience who belongs to the South African Police, it is quite probable, and maybe officials of the Attorney General, but they will be justified to sit here and have the right to be here, so what does it help if you prohibit the minutes from being spread but the total, all of the public including these certain institutions, have and they will be able to see Dr Basson's hand at this stage, before the prosecution even started.\n At this stage it is the application that it would, now it is only concerned with essential elements and you should protect him in the best way as you can, so this infringement to his right, which you are going to make, to give support to that.  If you will still be in a position to do your job as you are supposed to do it, therefore my submission is at this stage, in camera please.",

            "Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chair whatever I say now, like my colleague, has to be heard in the context of the earlier argument this morning.\n Firstly, public interest is not merely public curiosity.  The whole social contract which is reflected in the working of the Truth Commission in that it is transparent and interacting with the public, in terms of discovering what happened in the past, is much more fundamental and much more important to the creation of a new society based on truth and reconciliation, if the public is taken into the confidence of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in seeing the processes by which we are arriving at the truth, are beyond reproach.\n So the process is as important as the end result of the Truth Commission.  Secondly, the whole issue of the right to silence in so far as the potential prejudice to Dr Wouter Basson, is an issue which was extensively debated both here within this hearing which the Committee has previously ruled on, and which was extensively debated in court.  Our position remains the same, Section 31(3) of our Act and Section 35(5) of the Constitution adequately protects Dr Wouter Basson.\n In fact you saw the kind of protection that Mr Sifiso Nkabinde had, regarding those invasions into his rights.  Thirdly, there will be regardless of what the final decision of this panel is, whatever the ruling of this panel is, a final report drafted after having complied with Section 30 of our Act, in terms of which on the balance of probabilities, certain findings will have to be made.\n Accordingly I repeat the arguments raised earlier today.  The cases I refer to are the constitutional cases of (indistinct) v Levin and Nel v Le Roux, and I again request that the remainder of the hearing be accessible to the public and should it be necessary, we can make a specific ruling regarding the record of the proceedings, not being made available to parties such as the South African Police Services as well as anyone from the office of the Attorney General.\n Other than that, I will abide by the decision of the panel, thank you Mr Chairman.",

I have pointed out that it would be absurd for the Attorney General's office to in any way, have anything to do with this record.  It will simply taint their own case.\n However, if it is of concern to my learned friend, then there is no problem with such an order being made.  Any prejudice, potential prejudice which Dr Basson will suffer, has been taken into account by the relevant Sections of our Act and Constitution and therefore I do not believe that that argument has any basis.

            "Very briefly Chairperson.  The contra application, I've got that here with me and I will make it available to Mr Vally if he hasn't got one in his own possession, there is not a single reference in that contra application, to the public's right to be present, but the totality of the basis of the application that there would be an infringement of Dr Basson's right to silence, and this was purely the fact that you as a Committee, for your own purposes, you have to write a final report in the nearby future, so you must get the answers from Dr Basson.\n But there is not a single reference which I could find, in all those documents which centred around this need of yours, so it is on that basis that Justice Hlophe made that decision, and that it could be in camera and that the infringement would then be lightened.  The negative results would then be excluded and with the greatest respect, I find it really strange that now that the order was received from Hlophe and also that Dr Basson is prepared to stay with that and to give you the Committee, the answers because you really need the answers for your report, now there is a further request.\n Now the request comes it must take place in public.  The totality of the protection which was tendered in the application, you want to make that non worth it, so it is my submission that the judgment of Justice Hlophe, he hasn't given it yet, we can't see, but it can only be that there is an absolute, it is absolutely necessary for you to hear the truth, that is you, the Committee.\n It is on that basis that the application was brought in and it is my submission that Justice Hlophe's judgment would have been different if it was concerned with an open or closed hearing, and it is on that basis that I make the submission that you give complete protection to Dr Basson.\n With the greatest respect, if we have a situation here where a person is accused and he must testify in front of you and he must say things with regards to the charges which is brought against him, and that he has a right to silence, if this does not move you to have the proceedings in camera, then I would like to say I would like to see an application which was successful, because here we have an absolute need to protect this person's rights.  If this application is not granted, I would like to see the application that was granted.\n Maybe I can just formulate this to you properly and if you know about what was going to be asked, firstly we asked that the proceedings happen in camera, and that everybody be excluded - everybody who does not need to know this, should be excluded.\n The second application that no information should be made public regarding the evidence of Dr Basson.  It should not be made available to any person inasfar as it is necessary for the Committee in its official report, to possibly refer to the evidence.\n I am not trying to limit you in your reporting and in the third place, this would include that prohibition on publication that this would include that it should be prohibited that the minutes of these proceedings whether it is a sound recording or a written document, that it should not be made available to any person outside this Committee who needs it for the preparation of their report with a specific reference to the South African Police and the office of the Attorney General.

            "There is an application before us substantially in similar terms to one which was raised earlier today in these proceedings and that concerns the  public nature or otherwise of the proceedings which up to now have been conducted in public.\n The application is for the remaining testimony of Dr Basson which it appears to be common cause to a greater or lesser extent, would impact on questions that will arise at his criminal trial, his pending criminal trial, that those issues and the remaining testimony be taken in camera with a further ancillary order prohibiting the distribution of a record of the testimony which is to be given.\n The arguments have been presented to us at an earlier occasion.  Many of the arguments have been raised when there was the initial application not to compel Dr Basson to testify at this stage, but to hold over that testimony until after finalisation of the criminal trial.\n The submission in short of Mr Cilliers who again appears on behalf of Dr Basson, is based on what he refers to as the actual prejudice which Dr Basson will suffer in his criminal prosecution, should the remainder of his testimony be taken in public.  He submits that the prejudice lies in the fact that the testimony which he will now be giving, will amount to disclosing his hand at this stage, and it could be used for the purposes of the prosecution, to his prejudice.\n Mr Vally, who represents the interests of the Commission at these proceedings, has also restated basically his arguments which he had relied upon in opposing the earlier application which I have referred to of Dr Basson, not to be compelled to testify.\n He submits that Section 31 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act which regulates the affairs of the Commission, taken together with Section 35 of the present Constitution, provide adequate protection for Dr Basson in regard to the pending criminal prosecution.\n Mr Cilliers has referred in his arguments this morning, and in passing again when this application was made, to the danger of proliferation, but he has indicated that he mainly relies on the question of the prejudice in respect of the criminal trial, the pending criminal trial.\n The panel is sitting under extreme time constraints, this is the last day of the work of the Human Rights Violations Committee.  From the indications that have been given, there are quite a number of issues which Mr Vally still wishes to canvass with Dr Basson, so we are under the circumstances under pressure to respond immediately to this application.\n We will therefore not give full reasons for the ruling which will follow, save to say that having considered the arguments addressed to us and having taken into account the provisions of Section 31 of the TRC Act as well as the provisions of Section 35 of the Constitution, which are issues that have been raised at the recent High Court application which was launched by Dr Basson in order to review the earlier decision of this panel to hear his testimony, in spite of the pending criminal trial, we are of the view that sufficient protection is provided for in the law as it stands, and that there are no reasonable grounds for concluding that by hearing the testimony in public, which concerns issues which have already been largely canvassed through the testimony of other witnesses at these proceedings, in public, that Dr Basson would not suffer the actual prejudice which his counsel has submitted in his arguments to us.\n Taking into account the public importance of the subject matter of this particular hearing, the importance of the testimony of Dr Basson in regard to the Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme, we are satisfied that there is no grounds for ruling in terms of Section 33 that these proceedings should be conducted in camera.\n As an additional measure, which has been conceded by Mr Vally, we order that the record in the form of tapes, tape recordings or in the form of written notes, is not to be distributed to either the Attorney General who are engaged in the prosecution of Dr Basson, or in fact to any other Attorney General or to any member of the South African Police Services.\n And just to amplify the last part of the order, the prohibition also extends to any video recording of the proceedings.

Cholera is not such a kind of illness.\n It is very easily traceable and it is very easy even to determine where the cholera bacteria came from.  You can even say from which area it came.  I have studied through the years, but not with the purpose of using cholera.\n In essence the Department of Health is willing to go so far as to say that why there has never been cholera in Namibia and remember the Shonas in South Africa are well suited to cholera, but why there was no cholera is because the South African Defence Force was there, because they saw to it that the local population obtained clean water, they were aware of the dangers of dirty water and where there were people who carried this disease, they had to be treated.\n So what we achieved, was absolutely the opposite.",

Three months ago for example, the Department of Health - they have a Epidemiological Report which they bring out every three months, it is very clear that there are no cases in South Africa, no cases in Angola.\n In Namibia for example, there were mission hospitals where the staff were antagonistic against the government.

I am standing on the facts that I am giving you, there was not an outbreak of epidemic proportions after 1986 in South Africa.  It is evident that Mozambique has always been a cholera area and if you look at what the literature says, those outbreaks of cholera can be taken back all the way to Northern Africa, back to the bacteria that was responsible, it could be traced back to North Africa and you can also find the way that bacteria has walked all through Africa.\n Not one of these outbreaks of cholera is inexplicable.  If Mr Vally made the effort and read further, he would also see that the Department of Health in each of those cases in the old times, they could explain where they were coming from, which tribe was involved and how it ran its course.  So since 1987, according to the newest information, and that is a month ago, which is handed out by the Department of Health, there has not been more than maybe 16, maybe 20 cases of cholera in South Africa annually.\n Mozambique has always been a cholera country after the cholera was brought to Mozambique from North Africa.  So if Mr Vally wants to suggest that I took cholera to Northern Africa in 1980, I would say the project hadn't even started then.\n The history of cholera in Africa is very well described.  This specific cholera cultures to which he is referring, I imagine it must have been 1988, 1989 it can have no relevance to anything which happened in 1983 and even less so, if anything had happened in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, and once again, I want to conclude by saying that the Department of Health, every case of cholera outbreak was investigated by them to their satisfaction.\n There is not one unsolved case.",

After they have been deployed firstly, the first priority is the treatment of the patients.

Cyanide, I can go and buy cyanide and I can find it in any laboratory in this country.  I could go to the University of Cape Town, and I could have taken it off the shelves, natrium cyanide.\n But the important thing is that these things were readily available to the people who were trained by the Russians, where the Russians did not want to make the sophisticated weaponry available, because people did not know how to work it, so in our case the Russians came to us and asked us to destroy the programme.\n They did not trust the ANC with this, and in this specific case we used these things to give training.  We had to push agents into the field to do infiltration, and to go and perform certain actions and on a practical manner, I had to teach and demonstrate to these agents the techniques which were available to be used against them.\n It is very simple, with one or two chocolates, I cannot commit a genocide.

In a defence or military situation, it is a question of a situation that you have to keep your faculties together, to reach your objective.\n It is the same in a civil situation, you have to keep your faculties together to reach your objective.  There are a few ways to take your faculties away permanently, take them away, and that is to kill you.  You can't defend yourself, you can't think, you can't protect yourself.\n And by influencing a person's observational capacity and his perceptions, you can influence a person.  You can do that by disturbing the visual picture or also the brain's reaction on that.\n To change a person's emotions and you can cause the person not to achieve his objective.  That you can do by influencing the brain function so that the person does not recognise the threat or cannot handle this threat, or you can do it by various substances which can cause a lowering of the blood pressure.\n The person for example can't stand up straight because his blood pressure has fallen, and if he falls over he can't run away.  There are various such ways of incapacitating a person.\n The request of the Defence Force regarding incapacitants was to develop these substances which would not leave any permanent damage, and that group of incapacitants which did not cause permanent damage, were those working on the central nervous system and on the brain.\n The Defence Force said if we develop incapacitants, we did not have the money to develop a new weapon.  I could not develop a new projectile or a new delivery mechanism, we had to use existing delivery mechanisms which the Defence Force had.\n One of the existing methods was that certain substances would have to be released.  On a Friday evening you can walk around in town, and you would see various people incapacitating themselves by smoking.  We have learnt that trick from the local population.\n If you want to incapacitate people easily and without any costs, it should be something which would be absorbed through the lungs.  Every one of those things which Mr Vally mentioned, were things which could be inhaled through the nose or through the lungs.\n That would cause reversible effect on a person.

This position changed yesterday and with a great demand or with great problems for especially to clients, it is not necessary to mention their names now and because of my non-availability to day, I would have arranged that I would make preparations tonight.  I am seeing these clients tomorrow morning to enable us to finalise a submission.\n The deadline actually was today.  We will file that now on Monday.  I have to do the preparation tonight, and tomorrow the consultation and the finalisation.  That is my position.\n This is applicable to me and my client and my lawyer, Mr Van Zyl also.  Last night at half past ten I started consulting with my client and because at that stage, we only arrived in Cape Town we worked to round about two o'clock this morning. Eight o'clock we were here this morning, I had three, four hours of sleep last night, and the same applies to my client.  We have been here since eight o'clock this morning.  It is already five o'clock, and at this stage I am in a physical situation that I am tired, too tired to go on.\n The same applies to my client.  My client feels and he maintains that he prefers and that he has received advice that he need not answer questions if I am not available.\n That is unfortunately the situation.  I am repeating what we have said and as Mr Vally has said, what is still outstanding, it seems to me he has already covered all aspects.  I will give an undertaking and you can make such an order, that if any other aspects he requires information about, I will provide it in a written form.  I could supply it by next Friday.

That was made explicitly clear on Wednesday.\n There was no talk that Friday would not be necessary.  That is the first issue.  We have always made it clear we need at least two days.\n The second issue is we were told according to the strange instructions that Mr Van Niekerk received, that they had attempted to get other counsel, but Colonel Kaiser had declined them consent to obtain other counsel.\n Colonel Kaiser has confirmed in a letter that they were never approached to obtain alternative counsel.  \n Thirdly, we were told by Mr Van Niekerk that when they tried to contact Mr Malan, Adv Cilliers, Adv Van Zyl, they only got hold of Adv Cilliers, who said he was available on Friday.\n We were told he didn't get hold of Adv Van Zyl or Mr Malan.  Next yesterday we were told by Mr Van Niekerk that they tried a number of counsel in Pretoria and Cape Town, unsuccessfully, but in the morning we got a letter from Mr Malan, who said the only person who is suitable is Adv Cilliers.\n We now have a situation where Mr Cilliers wants to leave promptly at five o'clock.  This is unacceptable.  I believe, and I respectfully submit that by their conduct, they are trying to frustrate both the workings of this Committee as well as trying to frustrate the order granted by Justice Hlophe.\n I respectfully submit that if Adv Cilliers wishes to leave, that we be allowed to continue and I can't understand why yesterday and Wednesday there were no legal representatives available, today we have one, two, three, four and if you count Ms Nicole at the back, five people here representing Dr Wouter Basson, why none of them are available.\n I respectfully submit that this is a ploy to frustrate us, I have a number of questions left, we have not finished.  We still want to determine whether Dr Wouter Basson produced drugs to try and enslave the youth, if Dr Wouter Basson produced drugs to try and sell and make money, did Dr Basson actually dump any drugs in the sea or was this a fictitious series of events?  We cannot leave it here Mr Chairman.\n I would respectfully submit that we continue and Adv Cilliers, can make his election thereafter.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.",

Now Roodeplaat did not have the facilities for those kind of experiments.   The filters, or the extract products, after they were exposed to certain different temperatures and after they got older over certain periods, were then further analysed in laboratories.   I cannot remember which the specific laboratory was, but it was a pertinent part of this whole thing, we had different sub-components.   It could have happened at some or other university, it could have been at a private research institution, but it would have been completely unrelated to Roodeplaat and it would have been outside of context, and it sounds, and I'm scared of the word, sinister, I mean it sounds surreptitious, but in essence that's just a good - it's just to break up this whole thing into sub-components, so that there's no-one who's got only one answer.",

If Mr Vally does not regard it as an expansion of TRC52, I want to tell you that I cannot answer the question because I don't have competent legal counsel.

We can present documentation with the International Association of Police Chiefs already in the 1970's wrote thick documents how their task has been made difficult by the new generation of chemicals which are odourless and tasteless, thallium acetate can have no taste.  We know that thallium is tasteless because the acid which you add to that, that tastes like vinegar.   Odourless, tasteless is - with the Abiola sterk geval in Nigeria we had the example where some people held a post-mortem on his body, because these various toxins are there, and they said they could not find anything, because there's a large contingent of people who do not believe that.   Every research, and it was part of my duty to protect the South African community or society against such an onslaught. From a defensive point of view, we looked at these substances without odour or taste.  Professor Folb would say that that is just something which one cannot believe easily, there is no such thing as that.  If you look at the research you can find with the right equipment you can trace anything.   Work was done to identify these substances, but it's not something different from work being done world-wide, it wasn't a strange work and there was no preoccupation with this type of work, we did not give preference to this against ordinary defensive measures.",

I'm repeating, it was part of our defensive project to do research whether something like that was possible, and I want to tell you, in this world of the chemical and biological warfare, it's the world where there is the most misleading happenings world-wide.   What is the threat of the CBW?   Not the substance, but the threat surrounding these substances.   It's easy to say that one gram of a substance can kill a million people, but it's difficult to get one million people to stand in a row and inject all of them.\n The whole concept, and I want to say it, the reason why CBW contains such a threat is because of the risk it entails.   If I fight against an enemy and I know that he has chemical weapons and he throws some or other projectile on my troops and there's some or other red smoke and some or other person complains that his eyes are burning, what should I do in that regard?   All that I can do for that person is say, \"Put on your protective clothing\" because I, as a commanding officer, do not have the ability to decide within a few seconds what has landed on you, whether it was a lethal substance, so the soldier uses his protective clothing, and that means the effectivity is diminished by 60%, he can't hear, he can't run, so he cannot fight, but the enemy who threw that on me, he knows exactly what he has thrown on me and he could have made the necessary preparations to safeguard his troops, or they could have told them, \"Leave the clothes, just use the masks\", in other words the enemy's effectivity remains the same, and this substance which he throws on me, we do not know what it is, just the threat that they can use something on me, that is what CBW is about, it is about making the playing fields unequal, and I want to force my enemy to take in a certain stand where he has to demobilise himself by using protective clothes and he is diminishing his capabilities to fight.   If you can't see, hear or run, it's impossible to fight.   These are cardinal elements of warfare.   The problem is that the toxic potential of most of these substances are over-emphasised.   Where once we helped the Americans out of a predicament, where they heard that the Russians had developed a new CBW substance which goes through all filters and defence mechanisms.   Through our channels, we obtained that from Russia and we analysed it and we saw that it goes through every defence mechanism, and the western countries were hysterical about this.   Our approach was a bit different.   We were not worried because it went through all the filters... (intervention).",

When I was there, I was not influenced by that.   That was not part, and I'm not for or against that, I only experienced that the scientists I had contact with were worried about weapons of mass destruction, because they had the potential to be very harmful, when we saw in Tokyo, for example, with the subway incident.   The assistance I obtained was direct and indirect.   Some of the scientists were really worried about what the Eastern Bloc countries were doing.   Some of the scientists were more worried about what was happening in their own countries, and much of the information I gathered came from physicians for human rights.   What they did, they watched their governments so carefully to make sure that nothing would happen and they used the democratic systems in their own countries to obtain information and to force information from the government, and then they don't sell it, but they tell it to everybody else.   The same way in which SIPRI, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute handled their affairs.   We know that was a cover-up for the Eastern Bloc countries, because they were collecting databases of old chemical and biological warfare research countrywide and then made it available to embarrass the relevant countries.\n The answer I want to give you is a combination of yes, a great number of these scientists were afraid of the Eastern Bloc countries and saw us as a channel through which their problems could be addressed, and many of them were also worried about what their own governments were doing, and anybody who had a sympathetic ear, not about apartheid but about their own political situation in their countries, and that's why they provided us with information.   \n Apart from my South African passport making it very difficult for me to travel, I did not experience the apartheid problem in the scientific world, and there was no discrimination against me in that regard.",

If Mr Vally's going to continue with regards to these incapacitants, then I'd have to excuse myself and say that I cannot answer these questions because I do not have competent legal representation, except I would like to make one general comment, that if Mr Vally thinks that in general, with regards to chemical biological warfare research, at the head of the line in the general literature all over the world, it was ever published, then he lives on Planet Zero, he doesn't live on earth.   What would appear in international publications is basic pharmacological research.  I think there's enough pharmacological basis to describe all these substances as incapacitants.   You cannot drive a vehicle because you smoke grass, therefore it is an incapacitant, and the same goes for cocaine and several other of the substances mentioned.   So I don't think it has to be described in international publications, I think the government forced us to expose this project to the American and the British Intelligence Services, and there was questioning for six days and none of the Americans or the English expressed surprise that we've been doing this research.   As a matter of fact, a lot of them came to certain realisations and I think we did cause a bit of proliferation there when we gave the information where they thought they wouldn't receive any, and that's as far as I'm prepared to answer that question.",

We're not talking about small quantities for experimentation, we're talking about huge quantities.   How do you explain the fact that you were manufacturing such large quantities of illegal substances?",

            "Chairperson, it's late, I'm tired, can you please ask Mr Vally to make his questions short, I lose him halfway through his question.   I'd answer his question in this manner:  it's not so that General Neethling just gave us drugs.   There are signatures, there are delivery proofs of everything that he's given us.   That's available at the police forensic laboratory and we signed for everything we received.   So it wasn't like it was in the boot of my car.  By chance it was loaded into the boot of my car, because that's the only transport we had available to us, we didn't have Coin Security to work for us, the fact of the matter remains the quantities of which one speaks here is not as absurd as Mr Vally makes it to be.   Has Mr Vally got any idea what the monthly use of mandrax is in Cape Town?   If you can convey that to him, he'd probably find a completely different perspective with regards to this 1 000kg, and we have difficulty getting these facts from the South Africa Police, basically because they do not know, but if you go to look at projection figures and that which they confiscate, then one can accept that a 5% effectivity of the South African Police Department today is quite an acceptable level of success, then we talk about that 1 000 of kilogram, it's probably used up within a month or two in totality.   So I don't know why Mr Vally is concerned about 1 000kg, half of it was burnt and half of it was anyway thrown away, and we did it to create a pyrotechnic mechanism, and before I could finalise that, I used hundreds of kilograms to find the right recipe, you just don't throw a chemical substance into another mixture and then set fire to it, you've got to test different proportions, different quantities, different temperatures, and the problem with pyrotechnics is that you lose about 80% of your actual substance, a great variety of experiments must be done in order to check this combustion reaction, so one uses hundreds and hundreds of kilograms in an effort to do this research.\n So as far as the quantities are concerned, all I can tell you is that, in the broad spectrum of things, if Mr Vally wants to allege that these substances reached the streets, then I'd like to say that we could have made a month or two difference in the amount of time people's been using that drug.   To determine the amount of mandrax, thousands of kilograms a day is produced in India, which is spread all over the world.   So to talk about 1 000 or 1 500kg against the background of the years and years of abuse, then it's nothing.  It was one confiscation, they were all packed in the same manner, so it was the result of one confiscation by the police, and there were hundreds and hundreds of confiscations in the last few years.

Mandrax has got a different one, diphenhydromine(?), which is also part of mandrax, which is a more addictive substance.  So you'll find it in cough medicine and other medicine which has got anti-histamine, and it's actually treated by that.   So to make an allegation that methaqualone alone is addictive is absolute rubbish, there's no such thing, it's the combinations which cause the effect.   If mandrax was so addictive, would the user find it necessary to mix it with dagga?   Mandrax is not used on its own.   So you have a combination of three substances which work on the brain at one time.   Addiction is parallel to the amounts used, and not about one specific substance.

I also want to talk about an affidavit by Mr Jacome, Annexure G3, which Dr Basson has been given.   This was an affidavit made by Dr Jacome, who was used by Dr Basson to transmit money to Croatia to buy methaqualone.   This affidavit was made at the South African Embassy in Bonn on the 21st of January 1987 I believe.   No, no, I beg your pardon, it looks like there was a mistake here, on the 13th day of August 1994, I beg your pardon.

I find this upsetting, because we're once again moving in the economic area and instead of we're sticking to human rights violations, but if Mr Vally wants the answer, I'll give it to him.   The basic process of financial control in the South African Defence Force and specifically Project Coast, worked as follows. Annually there was a budget meeting and during this budget meeting certain goals and objectives were approved and specific amounts of money was allocated to them.   After these amounts were allocated, the projects for the year were then further implemented.   When the money was needed for a specific goal, the CCC or the financial management work group got together and if the amount was above a certain level, I can't remember the level, then approval was once again given that this amount of money be spent.   Now if this amount had to be spent, General Knobel wrote an authorisation where he authorises the spending of the amount of money.   If the spending of that money was authorised, then I could have taken that authorisation to the financial official of the project, and then he could get the funds to flow.   I had no signing authorisation, there was no way for me to control it.   If there were transfers to abroad, then we received authorisation from the South African Reserve Bank.   The CCC went to the South African Reserve Bank and to explain to the officials why the money was needed, in broad terms of course with regards to the secrecy, and to make sure that it's an official state transfer through the proper channels.   After this was done, the financial official then went back and the funds were then spent.\n Once again I'd like to say I did not have control over millions of dollars, I couldn't pick up the phone and do transfers or arrange transfers, I couldn't just phone people and give them codes, there was quite an integrated approval process.   I concede that at certain times when certain operational decisions were made quickly, I did have some discretion, but those discretions was not unapproved, and if I made my own discretion, it was approved de facto.   \n So to make an allegation that these millions was involved in any sense, firstly, in an uncontrolled process, and secondly in the violation of human rights or the buying of drugs to enslave South African people, the South African people did not need our assistance, I think they're more than willing to take their own risks and to obtain their own medicine in their own fashion, and I want to add, as far as Mr Jacome's affidavit is concerned, I have no control over that, I was not there, I was not present when it was taken, I did not influence him, I did not take his statement down in any way, I do not know why Jacome said what he said.",

If you look at that report, it's very clear that whoever was responsible for compiling that document is unclear about most of the information.   There was a problem regarding my own identity.   Up to 1996, our own National Intelligence, in a bail application I had, still confused my identity with that of another Basson.   Regarding the allegation, I want to say the following:  that so-called attack on Frelimo has been investigated properly, initially by the British Intelligence.   The attack on Frelimo was investigated in detail by an inexperienced doctor sent from Britain.   We warned him that he was busy not to be able to do his work, he hasn't worked in Africa before, he doesn't know Africa.  After his report, where they found it was a chemical attack, the United Nations sent representatives and their report was very clear - such an attack never had happened.

Then, come 1992, at a very young age, I thought you were, you must have been 42 then, you're retired, by the President of the country, he didn't come to you directly, but through other means, and you hear that there was the Steyn Report, which you've commented on already, what was your feeling at the time? \n I mean here you were, someone who'd dedicated yourself to protecting this country, and suddenly without any reason, or on what you say a flimsy report, you are dismissed at the age of 42, I understand you were brought in through other means back into the system, but officially you were dismissed from the army.    Now, again, just let me add a second bit to that question, I understand some of the other people who were also dismissed at the time challenged the decision. Were you one of those individuals too?   So, first of all, your own feelings about why and how you were dismissed, having dedicated yourself to this institute, and secondly, and to the country, and secondly were you one of the people who actually challenged the decision?",

In actual fact, not even the project leader, General Knobel, knew that this was going to happen.   In this evaluation of the programme by the so-called Steyn Report, nobody even took the trouble to speak to General Knobel, who was the project leader, and ask him if he knew what was going on at that stage.   So I can't say anything, but I have contempt for that report and I don't think it's worth the paper it's written on.   I also think that report affected the lives of several other generals, and, well not, and almost destroyed their lives and did a lot of harm.\n In my personal capacity I have never challenged this decision, for two reasons.   Maybe I was brainwashed, I was just a soldier and I accepted the decision of my superiors, if they say go, then I'll go, maybe that's a good quality of a soldier, he does what he's told.\n A lot of trouble also was done for me by people in the Defence Force in order to correct this faulty report, and it was often negotiated with me and I was told that this process would be corrected, and after a time I was reinstated.   I couldn't replace this, but a lot of people went through a lot of trouble to accommodate me, and this included certain government members, which I don't think it's necessary to mention their names, but it was handled on a very high level and I felt at one point that there was a true attempt to correct the faulty report and the facts, so that was one of the reasons why I didn't attack the dismissal, but I cannot think from my own personal experience it was a nice time in my life, it was not, and maybe we should look at my violation or my rights being violated.",
