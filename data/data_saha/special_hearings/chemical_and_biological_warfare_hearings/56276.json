            "I'll be commencing and Mr Chaskalson will be taking over Mr Chair.  The reason I'm beginning is, we need to invoke the provisions of Section 31 of our Act in respect of this witness.  I had a brief discussion with my learned friend.  If you look at Section 31(2) we may compel this witness to respond to questions which may be self incriminating.  In order for us to do that we have satisfy the requirements set out in Section 31(2).\n I can for the record, Mr Chairperson, confirm that:-\n (a) We have consulted with the Attorney-General who has jurisdiction for that requirement, Section 31(2).\n (b) We have to satisfy the panel that the information that we require from such a person is reasonable, necessary and justifiable in an open democratic society based on freedom and equality.  And I will briefly address these aspects.  \n Firstly, that the purpose of our Commission is an important both government concern and social concern in that we are trying to determine the gross violation of human rights in our mandate period and the value reflected therein in terms trying to expose gross violations of human rights would, I submit, reflect the values inherent in our Bill of Rights.\n Secondly, the restriction or the interference with the witness' constitutional rights is impaired no more than is absolutely necessary and in this regard I would refer to Section 31(3) of our Act which states:\n\"Any incriminating answer or information obtained or incriminating evidence directly or indirectly derived from a questioning in sub-Section (1) shall not be admissible as evidence against the person concerned in criminal proceedings in a Court of Law or before anybody or institution established by or under any law, provided that incriminating evidence arising from such questioning shall be admissible in criminal proceedings where the person is arraigned with a charge of perjury or a charge contemplated in terms of Section 39 of this Act or Section 319(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act\"\n Thirdly the benefits to be gained are not out of proportion to the restriction of the witness' constitutional rights and this regard I respectfully refer the Commission to the objectives as set out in our Act.\n And finally I would submit that the evidence given by this witness to the Commission, in view of our obligation to make a report to Parliament, to make recommendations as regards any potential future violation of human rights and what steps should be taken to prevent these are of significant social benefit to the society and therefore should be allowed to be led.  \n And I would respectfully submit that this meets the requirement as set out in Section 31(2) (b), that the information we require is reasonable, necessary and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality.\n As regards the third issue, Section 31 Sub-(2), Sub-(c) we need to satisfy ourselves that the person has refused or is likely to refuse to answer a question or produce an article on the grounds that such an answer or article might incriminate him or her.  \n My learned friend will confirm that in discussions before my submission that there is a possibility that he, a likelihood as the Act states that Doctor Swanepoel would have declined to answer questions on the basis that they may incriminate him and on that basis I have made my submission.  Thank you Mr Chair.",

I did give an indication that there might be some difficulties regarding incriminating questions and I agree with his suggestion that we in advance, bring into operation the specific provisions in order to protect the witness against the result of giving incriminating answers already at this stage, then we don't have any difficulties further, then he can without difficulty answer any questions put to him at any stage of the proceedings and we don't need argument in-between, whether this might an incriminating question or not.\n It's always a very difficult situation to handle, so I agree with the submission by my learned friend, that at this stage already the provisions of the specific Section are being brought in operation by yourselves and that the specific indemnity is given to Doctor Swanepoel.",

If it so becomes that it is necessary for the witness to be called then the witness will have to be called.\n Thirdly, isn't it about prejudice that this whole thing turns on?  And if it is on the basis of potential or real prejudice, being the issue insofar as your clients are concerned, and if we are going to make a finding because I think in line with, certainly some authorities, where a finding which is detrimental to the person who is mentioned to his or her detriment is going to be made, then an opportunity must be made available to the person prejudiced by that evidence in one or two forms.  Section 30 I think provides, it can be either in terms of written submissions or if it becomes necessary for the witness who made these allegations to be brought for subjection to cross-examination.\n What I'm trying to get at is, is it not something that, to use a colloquialism, we should play be the ear?  Let's have your objection noted only to the extent, unless of course you are going to argue very strongly and with authority that it is totally inadmissible, only to the extent that it can be admitted but no weight should be given to it.",

            "As it pleases you Mr Chairman, it's possible to argue that what you're proposing is perhaps in the direction Mr Potgieter is moving with his questions.  Perhaps a practical approach will save time and which will eliminate all disadvantages.  If can answer your questions in a certain order, whether it's admissible or not, it is not my argument that is not admissible.  You will have a discretion in determining your procedures to allow such a document or not.\n The argument goes further than that, it's based on that discretion.  And my submission is that you already at this stage have enough evidence to say that I don't want to take in this document.  Immelman is a very important witness, perhaps one of the most important, it not the most important and he must come to these proceedings.  He is available, he has been subpoenaed.   The submission I'm making is that in the exercise of your discretion you should not allow that negotiations take place and people be kept away who are necessary here to be able to determine the truth.  These people are available and for some or other negotiation with the Attorney-General, because of that they are not being called.  \n The reason why he is not being called is very, very improper.  In your search for truth, that is why you are here and a lot of money is spent on that, the evidence of almost the most important witness is not heard because the Attorney-General tells that this is going to impede my criminal case.  But at the same time the accused in that criminal case whose rights are being protected by the Constitution, forget about their rights, we are only protecting State witnesses not the accused.  That is not the impression that should be created here.  \n Regarding the admission here at this stage, just for a few questions, you are probably right, there is not total prejudicial circumstances which cannot be set right.  You can exercise your discretion afterwards and say the witness must still come here to be cross-examined.  I would request that after we've completed this evidence we should address you about this question, whether Immelman should testify or not and then you should make a relevant decision and make a ruling so that there's enough time to, before the end of the week, to fit him into the time slot.  \n I find it strange that these arrangements - I'm not saying Mr Chaskalson as a person was involved as a person and I'm referring to the evidence leaders, that they and the Attorney-General negotiated without Mr Immelmann's lawyer being informed about this.  I find this very strange that he was not involved.",

When I moved to RTO, one of the reasons was, he went to RTO, but he had to report back to me, so I remained involved with him.  He came back from RTO, because there he was not available and he also hampered the contracts with Eskom and the Police and with the Defence Force.  We had to appoint another Managing Director, and I consulted with him again.  I withdrew him, or I drew him back to RRL to give Dr Goosen another opportunity to improve his image, and I made him head of the experimental animal section, but sometimes his people could not get hold of him because the one says he's there and the other says he there, nobody knew where he was.  And then in the end Dr Goosen used the company for his own personal gain and he also used means from the company, and I want to make this statement, and the evidence is there, that the builders who built RRL, he asked them to make renovations to his house and then he drew a subsidy for that.

Part of the structures that were created were then also holder companies and the shareholders trust within the company.  Perhaps I am missing the point now, but the intention of the company was to privatise, to take over commercial projects in its full capacity to deal with commercial projects.  The Defence Force indicated that they would cease their projects, they did however conclude a contract with us for a further five years in 1989, or sorry, 1990 and with this contract we decided that we would deal with it and we would continue with the process.  In the privatisation process we gave them a loan account, the Defence Force, and we also had to buy the property from them.  In due course the Defence Force informed us that they had to implement increased option regarding the ending of contracts because they wanted to terminate the work and take everything back.  Our provision was that we would continue with the company.  In a specific year, I think this was also 1990, Minister Pik Botha announced in declare that we did not have chemical biological abilities, but he had to correct himself later and say that we did have this capability and this specific convention wanted to know who was involved, who were all the elements and what is their involvement in this specific subject, and on this basis we undertook not to make this known - it was undertaken not to make this known, but we were made known world-wide in terms of our involvement in the project and we started losing our clients, our commercial clients, that around which our whole company was built.  At that stage we tried to negotiate with our clients, and we said stay with us, we will carry on dealing with your things, things are changing, but they also said to us, no, let's rather leave it at that, we are no longer interested.  So we started losing clients as a result of the public making of this.  This led to the process that finally we had to liquidate or subsidise the company with no prediction of the results thereof.",
