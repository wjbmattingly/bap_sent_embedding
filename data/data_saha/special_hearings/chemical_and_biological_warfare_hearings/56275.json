I am just mentioning it so it wouldn't leave the impression that many things are not in dispute.  Many aspects are placed in dispute, but they will not be addressed during cross-examination.\n Dr Van Rensburg, I don't have clarity regarding exactly what your function was at RRL.

You should be knowledgeable enough to go in there, see the symptoms, make a guess, get the forensic examinations of the (indistinct) if there are any, to be able to sample the environment, the food they ate, the water source.  You must come back to the laboratory, you must take a guess, there guys were given Thallium or Botulism or whatever, you must have the apparatus ready, you must have reference substance ready to measure, to calibrate your instruments so that you can detect minute amounts in tissues or food or whatever.\n If you know what the enemy is doing, it is always a great shock if the enemy knows that you know.

The hearing being referred to there, is the amnesty application.\n I refer to the ruling of Judge Nugent in the inquest into the Khotso House killings, where he stated that there was no obligation on persons number one, to even disclose whether they made an application for amnesty, but number two, not to disclose the applications as such.  This is a ruling in that matter.\n He went much further to speculate whether we were ourselves, entitled to even release this applications.  The ruling of Judge Nugent in the Khotso House inquest is very clear and at the very least, at the very least, Mr Van Rensburg has that option.\n If the Commission had decided to release it, if we used it, then my learned friend would be entitled to it.

The legal position is there is a distinction between the South African law and the Canadian law. And the Canadian and European law where total procedures could be suspended and the choice which a person then has to testify is not a proper choice. Because of the prejudice during a criminal court case. The South African law follows a stricter approach because the choice to give evidence even if it is a difficult choice is still a choice. Here is now a case of statutory force and the proceeding regarding the interrogation of the witness taking into consideration his right to keep silent would not be impeded.",
