            "Just from a process point of view Mr Vally, I do not know if this wouldn't be an appropriate time for Mr Cilliers to place on record his position with regard to this morning in view of developments that have taken place, so that, you know, the record should be straight with regard to it.  Mr Cilliers if you could get yourself to a microphone.\n Mr Cilliers Mr Vally placed several things on record, one of which was that there had been correspondence between himself and Mr Dolf Malan, who I believe is an attorney instructing your good self, and that this correspondence culminated in a letter of yesterday in which he indicated that since we had not received any application papers, except draft application papers, and the expectation was that your client would have to appear before us at nine o'clock today, that prompted us to concede to Mr Vally's entreaties to us to have Mr Basson's name called out three times outside.  And when there was no response from him we were prevailed upon, and we did in fact find that subject to what submissions and representations you might make when you do come, because Mr van Zyl indicated that you might be coming, we were of the prima facie view that there had been a contravention of Section 39 of our Act.  That is the view that is on record.\n It is now an historical fact that you came almost immediately thereafter and you have remained in attendance.   We have since also been told that application papers, in relation to the matter that you had indicated an application would be made had actually been served on us and that seemed to be putting some other colour on the proceedings. It is true that these papers come at a time when we had least expected them because that was not the arrangement, but that is neither here nor there.  The papers are with us now and I think that process will have to take place.\n Now I thought that it would only be fair if you were given an opportunity now, rather than later, to place your own side of the story on record so that we can deal with this matter and get it out of the way.",

            "As it pleases you Chairperson, thank you for the opportunity.\n I didn't see all the correspondence which resulted from the discussions between Mr Chaskalson and Mr Malan, but the import of it, as I understand, was that should the application be served by today then there would be no arrangement for Dr Basson to be present.  I received the papers and the original documents, the stamped documents are here, and according to those papers the application was received by the Master yesterday.  I have no notification as to when it was served but I heard it was at 09H30 this morning that it was received here.  I understood that it was received by the Master yesterday for service, but I can't dispute Mr Vally or Mr Chaskalson's allegation that it was only received this morning.  So as far as I am concerned that if the application had been served and received by yourself in time then there would be no necessity for Dr Basson to appear.  We made the papers available quite some time ago at our corresponding attorneys and unfortunately it cannot be done by means of a fax because the original signed papers must be served.  That is probably what caused the slight delay.  \n To meet the urgency of the matter we, at an early stage, drafted a draft document in identical terms and sent it by means of a fax to Mr Chaskalson so that if certain answers had to be prepared by your office that you could have ample opportunity to do so.  And also to expedite matters we, in respect of the Rule 43 procedures, we deviated from those procedures to save time.  It is a time-consuming process.  As you know it affords parties 30 days to make records available and give parties time to answer etc.  It can take up to three months to prepare the papers.  \n So by agreement with your office, and I am specifically referring to Mr Chaskalson, we followed the Rule 6 procedure which should the answer be available by tomorrow or today we can reply within a couple of days and we could probably be in court already by next week.  \n So Dr Basson isn't here in terms of that arrangement, unfortunately, maybe the Deputy Sheriff only served those papers on your office this morning rather than yesterday as he was requested to do.",

Paragraph 49 starts off\n\"Information by Brigadier Basson supplied.\n Methaqualone was one of the incapacitating agents which was investigated in 1987 as part of the offensive CPOA programme and this substance, as some others which were experimentally manufactured, proved itself to be very good for application in the pyrotechnical format.\n In this connection the necessary substances of methaqualone and a number of derivatives thereof were manufactured.  The physiological effect on the target persons and experimental animals were determined and a number of mortars or samples were prepared for experimental purposes.\n The results thereof were fair or reasonable, although it appeared that the intense excitation and stress and tension which were caused or induced in the target persons during armed skirmishes could lead to the fact that this substance took longer to have the desired effect as what was noticed in experimental cases.  \n The utilisation of the substance was stopped in 1988\".\nAnd then it goes on -\n\"Since then a far more effective analog was developed by means of further research which should obviate the above drawback\".\n Now are we to understand from this firstly, that there were experiments done on animals and in people, and in fact it was used in a combat situation, the incapacitant which was made up of, amongst other things, methaqualone?",

As I understood it volunteers of Special Forces but also of 7 Medical Battalion group took part in simulation exercises in which they tested these few mortars to see what the effect would be on humans within battle conditions.\n So when you say experimentation it was a voluntary exercise, the type of exercise that I took part in myself at a later stage with regards to CR, not only to test the equipment that we had developed to see if we were protected against it well enough with our equipment, but also to see whether we could endure the effects of CR without using masks and filters and so on.\n Now in this particular case I was not involved or present with these exercises but this is the information as was provided to me by Brig Basson in answer to the question of the Office of Serious Economic Offences.",

We also know that at least a 1000 kilograms of methaqualone was produced at Delta-G.

The way I understood was initially, the initial work on methaqualone was done on the methaqualone which was extracted from the mandrax tablets that we were referring to this morning and which was dealt with in quite a lot of detail by General Neethling, and the impression I got when he gave his evidence is that 200,000 tablets in fact produces very little of the basic ground substance that you require.\n The production, as far as I am concerned, and it is also written in this letter to the OSEO was done at Delta-G Scientific.   We were informed at the Command Council meeting, or rather the Coordinating Management Committee level, that the purity of the methaqualone that was obtained was not adequate and that they were going to look for a different source overseas.  And that work that you are referring to was actually done in 1991.  The problem that arose was dealt with in '92/'93 as you will have gathered from the documents that I made available to you about the Croatian incident.  \n But when we briefed the Minister in 1993, Minister Louw, in that briefing you will see that we report that there is methaqualone available on the shelf, as it were, on the shelf.  That was the document of November '92 which said, what did we have in our possession and we reported that to the Minister.  To my mind that, or to my satisfaction that was the total quantity of methaqualone that we had available, which is the quantity which was then destroyed after the Minister gave permission to us to destroy it.\n You will notice, just if I may point out, to paragraph 51 of the document we are looking at, at the moment, we are talking there about \"rooe materiale\", in other words the basic ground substances.  Possibly Professor Folb can help us with a better word than ground substances.  But that had to be of a pure nature from which the methaqualone derivative or analog could then be produced.",

You will remember that.\n You will also remember that in that Coordinating Management Committee meeting that it is reported that the police at that stage did not want to be involved in the destruction process and instead of a policeman we then asked somebody from the Counter-Intelligence department to accompany the flight, which was I think a Commandant de Bruin.

            "Certainly I had to be briefed and also the Chief of the Defence Force.  The full Coordinating Management Committee met really only for budgetary purposes after '81.  As I indicated here Mr Vally, when I took over as Surgeon-General the first thing that I did with regards to this project was to get a full briefing on it and to find out exactly where we stood with regards to achieving the objectives which had been approved for this particular project.  I then was satisfied that we had achieved most of our objectives.\n Secondly, the threat that existed before and it was perceived to exist within Angola, and particularly within the surrogate forces, the Cuban forces and so on, was diminishing because the Defence Force were involved in the negotiating process which led to the withdrawal of the Cubans from Angola.\n Thirdly, the budgetary allocation to the project was being reduced because of general budgetary cuts within the Defence Force.  My attitude was that, as far as I could determine, certainly with regards to the defensive equipment that had been developed, we had satisfied all the objectives.\n However, as I indicated in some other documents and as I indicated to you with regard to the briefing to the State President later on, South Africa was moving towards a negotiating process.  We were involved in - or we were very much aware of mass action and riot control and emergency situations which were declared by the President, and the emphasis then turned to what we called \"dual use\" chemical agents.  CR was already available as an outstanding anti-riot agent, but also as an alternative to a retaliatory agent which could be used on the battlefield.  The battlefield threat was diminishing, the riot situation was increasing.  That is why the emphasis fell onto the incapacitating agents and the four varieties that were investigated.\n So what I am saying here is, for that purpose the project had to continue, the Coordinating Management Committee overruled my suggestion that we should consider beginning to scale it down and begin with the privatisation and commercialisation process immediately; that we should continue with the incapacitating agents.  When the briefing was given to the President he confirmed that and he also gave the indication that we should continue.\n At the same time you must remember I was the advisor to the Department of Foreign Affairs with regards to what was happening on the international front in terms of the convention.  In 1989, a year after I became Surgeon-General, I accompanied Mr Pik Botha to a conference in Paris where the countries that had signed the original chemical weapons convention, the old 1925 Protocol, and many other countries had decided that that Protocol was redundant, that it was not wide enough, it didn't cover the field properly, and a new chemical convention would have to be designed and signed.  That was in 1989.\n At that time I was given the responsibility, as was my predecessor, to ensure that whatever happens in the project takes place within the parameters of the existing conventions as well as this convention which was going to be signed in the future. So we literally had from 1989 until the actual convention was signed.  The convention, as you know, was signed in 1993 and you know what happened when we were due to sign it and what I reported to the Minister.\n So I am saying the Coordinating Management Committee met on an annual basis to approve the budget but there were other meetings held where it was mainly the Chief of the Defence Force and mainly the Chief of Staff, Finance and the Chief of Staff, Intelligence, and myself that had briefings from the project officer about what progress was made with regard to the project.",

In those minutes Brigadier Basson gives feedback in paragraph 5 about what had occurred, he indicates that the police were not prepared to go along with the flight, that we would ask the Director of Counter Intelligence to issue a certificate.  He also says that they took samples.\n The Chief of the Defence Force then says it should be kept by the Chief Director of Counter Intelligence until the destruction has been confirmed to the Minister and if he then has no further problems with it then the samples can be destroyed.  That's the instruction of the Chief of the Defence Force.  \n When the feedback was given to the Minister we said: \"Well what do we do with these samples, let's get confirmation of what is in it\".  Chief of Counter Intelligence doesn't have a laboratory capability, so the negotiations take place with the police service to see if they would be prepared to do this for us.
