These are not normal circumstances and may I add, they are not normal circumstances brought about by the panel or by anyone as was argued in Court.  They are normal circumstances which have been brought about by a lackadaisical and cavalier approach by this particular witness, both to the question of him bringing an application in Court virtually in July when they had made an undertaking on the 12th of June that they would bring an urgent application to seek the relief that they wanted to get in Court.\n I am not persuaded and I speak on behalf of this entire panel, I am not persuaded that this witness has been dealt with unfairly.  I am still wanting to know why Mr Basson did not arrive here yesterday and I am not prepared to take his explanation that he had things to do.

The position is Mr Chairman, that Doctor Basson was busy at the Pretoria Academic Hospital until after 6 o'clock last night.\n I must also place on record that the Notice of Motion that was issued by this Commission's attorneys asked for an order as referred to by you in the following terms Sir, and in view of your accusation that Doctor Basson is adopting a somewhat cavalier attitude towards this Committee, perhaps it is just as well that I read the relevant portion of the Prayers of the Notice of Motion and place same on the record.\n There was a counter application filed in this matter and the Notice of Motion is dated the 14th of July, as referred to by you.  The second Prayer in that Notice of Motion says as follows:\n\"That the applicant be directed to appear before the Respondent\"\nthat is this Commission.\n\"on Wednesday the 29th of July 1998 and to answer all questions lawfully put to him\"\nNow Mr Chairman, I am instructed that the Order of Mr Justice Hlope is to the effect that:\n\"That the applicant be directed to appear before the Respondent on Wednesday the 29th of July 1998 and to answer questions lawfully put to him\"\nDoctor Basson was here at 09H15 this morning Mr Chairman.  There was not time stipulated, either in the Notice of Motion nor in the Order of Court, that Doctor Basson should be here at 9 a.m.  \n A letter dated the 27th of July was forwarded to Doctor Basson's Pretoria attorneys, Messrs Adolf Malan and Vermeulen and he was requested before the Human Rights Violations Committee on Wednesday the 29th of July 1998 commencing at 9 a.m. on the 10th Floor and so on.  That was merely contained in a letter and the contents of that letter were passed on to Doctor Basson yesterday at about midday.\n I submit under the circumstances that Doctor Basson is neither a cavalier attitude in arriving here at 09H15 nor in any way showing disrespect to this Committee.",

Firstly, as has been pointed out by the Chairperson, that as at the 14th of July when our application or counter-application was served on Doctor Basson's legal representatives, it was clear that we were asking for an Order instructing Doctor Basson to appear before us today on the 29th of July.\n Secondly, when this Order was granted in the Cape High Court by Judge Hlope on the 27th of July 1998, he was aware of the arguments put forward by Doctor Basson's legal representatives to the effect that those specific advocates were not available today.  Being aware of those arguments, he gave us an Order instructing Doctor Basson to be present here today.  \n Thirdly, we returned a phone call to Doctor Wouter Basson's advocate yesterday at six twenty five p.m. specifically from Mr Adolf Malan.  He advised us as to what Doctor Wouter Basson has instructed his attorney presently, that the counsel, and I refer to all three counsel, Advocate Piet de Jager SC, Advocate Cilliers and Advocate van Zyl, were not available today.  He also advised us that the South African National Defence Force, which is responsible for footing the bill for Doctor Wouter Basson's appearances before the Truth Commission was not amenable to Doctor Wouter Basson instructing other counsel.\n We then called Colonel Kaiser at eight twenty a.m. this morning.  He is the gentleman in the South African National Defence Force who liaises with persons needing legal representation.  He advised us that he in fact had contacted Doctor Basson's attorneys yesterday after he got an enquiry from General Knobel's attorneys as to whether this matter was proceeding today.  \n I enquired from him as to whether he had refused permission for an alternative advocate to be briefed by Doctor Basson's attorneys.  He advised me that he had not.  He stated that no such request had been made to him.  I have given a copy of a letter which I sent to Doctor Basson's attorneys today, to Mr Malan.

You advised us that none of your counsel, that is Advocate Cilliers, van Zyl or de Jager were available to represent your client at the hearing on the 29th of July 1998.  You further advised us that the SANDF had declined to allow you to brief alternative counsel for the said hearing.  We contacted Colonel Kaiser of the SANDF today.  He advised us that he had in fact contacted you yesterday after receiving a query from General Knobel's attorney and that you had indicated to him that your counsel were not available to attend today's hearing.  However, you did not them or previously request consent to brief alternative counsel to represent your client at our hearing and have not done so to date.  He further indicated that he would have considered such an application sympathetically and would have consulted with the State Attorney concerning this issue should such a request have been directed to him.  In the circumstances, and especially as your client was aware of the relief sought by us as early as the 14th of July 1998 and which was subsequently granted by the Cape High Court on the 27th of July 1998, we trust that your client will comply with the said Court Order, failing which, we reserve our rights to take appropriate legal steps\"\nAnd the letter ends there.\n I just have one further item to add.  If the panel is inclined to grant a postponement I would strongly recommend that the postponement be no longer than tomorrow.  We will need at least two days to canvass all the issues we wish to canvass with Doctor Wouter Basson.   If such a decision is made to grant a postponement, it should not be longer than Thursday the 30th.  As we are aware and as has been made clear and again for the record, in terms Act 33 of 1998, this is the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Amendment Act, we are expressly not allowed to have anymore hearings in terms of Section 29 after the 31st of July 1998.  \n So effectively, if any postponement after this date is being sought this is to frustrate, number one, the workings of this Commission and number two, it will be contemptuous of the Order granted by the Cape High Court on Monday the 27th of July 1998.

In the light of the Judgment of Justice Hlope on the 27th of July 1998, it is my instructions from my client that in spite of the short time given to him in terms of this order, he is prepared to appear before this Commission.\n 2. It is further my instructions that the client seen in the light of this mentioned order is prepared to answer any questions which are legally put to him.\n 3. It is further my instructions that not one of Doctor Basson's legal representatives who consulted with him and who prepared to assist him during questioning before this Commission, are available to appear to assist him during questioning in terms of Prayer 2 of the mentioned Order referred to above.  It is further my instructions that in the light of the great extent of these documents relevant to this questioning and also the relevant facts, it was totally impossible for my client to give anybody instructions to assist him.\n 4. It is further my instructions that the Bar Counsel have been approached by the legal representatives of my client to clear the ethical position in the light of these particular circumstances.  I want to make it clear that the reason for the fact that the legal representatives of my client who prepared to assist him during the questioning not being present here is because of the short notice of this date of questioning.  It is then also in the pleadings before this Court and the decision of the Bar Counsel was that the legal representatives are bound through the instructions which they have taken earlier and that in terms of the ethical rules, they are obliged to fulfil those instructions.  \n 5. It is further my instruction and my submission that my client, in terms of Article 34(1) of the Truth Commission Act is entitled to legal representation during questioning. \n It is also my submission that it is one of my client's fundamental rights in terms of the Constitution.\n 6. The further submission for my client is then that such legal representation should mean effective representation.  In other words by a legal representatives who had the time to prepare themselves properly and to scrutinise the relevant documentation.\n 7. I want to bring it under the attention of the Committee that I personally had no occasion to consult or had any insight into any documentation.  I can say that I've met this client for the first time today.  I did not have the opportunity to study the record of the previous proceedings.  \n 8. It is further my instructions that the instance who finances the legal representation of the SANDF is not prepared to supply new legal representation.  The huge costs associated with the duplication of work is the main reason.  Practically they would not be able to prepare timeously for this questioning.  \n 9. It is my instructions once again to confirm that my client would not ignore the order the justice.  He is prepared to comply in all respects.  In the light of the problems mentioned above, my client is not prepared to testify without legal representation.  To give execution to the order of Honourable Judge, my client is prepared to answer in writing on any questions posed by this Committee should he be given the opportunity and to prepare these answers with the assistance of his legal representatives who can assist him.\n My client further indicates that he will subject himself to any time limits posed by this Committee for the provision of such answer as is humanly possible.  My instructions are furthermore that the answers should be provided by means of procedures which according to my instructions have already been followed during the working of this Committee in respect of other witnesses\"",

The sole issue that we adjourned for was for you to obtain and unequivocal commitment on the part of the Gauteng legal representatives as to their availability tomorrow and possibly Friday.

            "Well I will go through it very quickly. But the issues I want to raise are under the general umbrella that this is part of the pattern, by Dr Wouter Basson, to frustrate the work of this Commission, and I would remind the panel again that when he brought his application to interdict us or review our decision not to hear his evidence, he brought it by ordinary time periods.  He did not bring it by urgency, and in the normal course of events there is no way that we could have got a judgment prior to our time running out.  So that pattern is being repeated here in terms of the confusing instructions that are set out here.\n Now factually there are certain issues which I want to take up with the legal representative of Dr Basson.\n Firstly paragraph 3, the sentence -\n\"It is my further instructions that not one of Dr Basson's legal representatives who consulted with him and who prepared him for questioning by the Commission is available.\"\n I understood from my conversation with Mr Malan, the attorney for Dr Wouter Basson, that the reason he wouldn't be here today is that he had to see the SANDF to try and persuade them to allow him to instruct alternative counsel.  I don't know if he has any other reasons but this is all he told me.\nWe have already talked about the fact that Colonel Kaiser said he has not been approached on this issue before.  \n I specifically asked Mr Malan why he did not, himself, represent Dr Basson, his response was that he did not feel he was adequately prepared.  I am paraphrasing here, those may not be his exact words, but that's the effect of what he told me.\n So firstly I would respectfully submit that Mr Malan may possibly have been available.\n Secondly, we've already talked about the fact that the SANDF have not been approached regarding the briefing of alternative counsel.  We don't have anything to add on that issue.\n The other very important issue that I want to take up is this suggestion that we submit written questions to Dr Wouter Basson.  From our point of view leading evidence here we think this is the most disingenuous position taken by Dr Wouter Basson to date.\n The reason why we say this is that a long time ago, after a series of negotiations, we agreed to send some questions to Dr Wouter Basson.  On the 30th of April 1998 we did under some conditions.  This is DBN9 in the court papers.  Mr van Niekerk has advised us that he has seen the court papers.  We said these are the conditions under which we send the written questions to Dr Wouter Basson.\n1. The written questions in no way take the place of the proposed hearing.\n 2. The same questions and/or follow-up questions may be asked of your clients in both the written questions and at the hearing under oath.\n 3. The written questions are in no way exhaustive of all possible ......\"",

There were altogether approximately 35 questions.  These were just initial questions for us to save time at the hearing.\n We were then asked to give an extension in a letter of the 7th of May to the 15th of May.  This is from attorneys, Adolf Malan and Vermeulen.  It says:\n\"We would appreciate it if we were given an extension to respond to the questions until the 15th of May 1998\".\nIt says so in Afrikaans.\n We responded and said, yes, you have that extension. We responded on the 11th of May.\n On the 15th of May we were then contacted and said, we can't answer the questions until we get certain documentation.  We advised them that we would give them the documentation with the Section 29 notice, and we asked them to please respond again to the questions. We also said that in the interim he could respond to questions before getting the documentation if he was in a position to do so, and I am talking about questions like your qualifications, your position in the Defence Force, innocuous questions.\n On the 18th of May he said they were unable to answer any questions until they got the documentation.  We then said that this was not in terms of our undertaking, but, this is on the 18th of May, we are in a process of serving subpoenas on you in this week with the documentation, please let us have your response.\n On the 26th of May, after the Section 29 notice was served with the documentation, we again asked for answers to the questions.  On the 29th of May we again asked where were the answers to the questions.  And on the 4th of June we again asked where were the answers to the questions.  Now you must remember the hearings started on the 8th of June.\n Now Dr Basson has the temerity to ask us to submit questions to him in writing at this stage, after a court application where he was ordered to appear before us and answer questions in writing; after he had promised on the 30th of April 1998 that he would respond to very general, a lot of them were innocuous questions, we still haven't got an answer to those questions.  I believe that this is part of a plot to sabotage these particular hearings into Chemical and Biological Warfare, but Dr Wouter Basson, and I strongly urge the panel not to allow Dr Basson to misdirect the panel as regards the issue of written questions.  \n This Commission has previously taken a very strong stance on people who refuse to appear before us, no less a person than Mr P W Botha also demanded we send him written questions and we refused and that criminal trial is still pending. \n I think in view of Dr Wouter Basson's history in this matter, how he has dealt with us; the fact that he tried to use the court processes to sabotage us coming to a conclusion regarding this matter; the fact that the court has ordered him to appear; the fact that we were told that they were not allowed to brief alternative counsel whereas the Defence Force says no such request was made, and now having not responded to our previous questions asking us to submit all our questions in writing is indicative of the strategy being adopted by Dr Wouter Basson, and this panel should not tolerate it.  At very least should the panel feel so inclined it can be postponed until tomorrow, but I strongly would urge that this not be postponed to any date after the 30th of July, firstly, if the panel so decides; and secondly, that it should be made absolutely clear to Dr Basson that we are not inclined to submit questions to him in writing in view of his past conduct regarding questions submitted to him in writing and that that is not even an issue that we are considering.\n Thank you Mr Chair.",

There was ample time for you to approach the military people long before.

            "I am afraid that the perception that you have gained might be your perception or it might be shared by the rest of the panel at no stage did I attempt to delay anything.  I have tried to look after my legal rights.  Mr Vally's long speech about discussions to and fro, I was under the impression that I could exercise my Constitutional right to remain silent, and in my awaiting of the documentation, which I have received at a very late stage, I think I only received it at the end of May together with the order to appear here today I decided not to answer these questions.  And it happened that I was later on advised by my legal representatives that I must inform Mr Vally that I will not answer the questions.  This was changed by the fact that Judge Hlophe ordered me to testify.  Now this would give me satisfactory protection for myself in the sense that I will, together with my legal representatives answer these questions.  This would be satisfactory for me.\n The offer, and I do not like the word offer, but the possible compromise to save the time that might be lost in an attempt to put together a legal team for me, that some of this time could be saved with written answers which will not be done in terms of a request from anybody but in terms of Judge Hlophe's order.  That is how I see this aspect.  \n I have not tried to delay anything.  The week of the 8th or 12th of June I attended the hearing, time could have been saved by having me testify on the Monday instead of the Wednesday.  I do not want to go into those issues.  I am not convinced and I do not believe that I have done anything to delay the procedures before this Committee.\n My personal contribution, my responsibility and what I have read of the record of the Truth Commission I am not convinced that I can contribute to a great extent to what has been heard before the Commission.  What has been said before was said by inferiors and some of my superiors.  I am not sure how I can contribute to that.  Even though I do have certain doubts I am here this morning and I did what the Judge told me to do.  The only thing I asked was that everybody knew beforehand that I would not have a legal representative available for this hearing.  This does not make me less responsible.",

            "Thank you Dr Basson.\nR U L I N G\n This is an application for a postponement made on behalf of Dr Wouter Basson to a date convenient to the Commission.  The bases that have been given to us vary, but the essence thereof is that it is to afford Dr Wouter Basson an opportunity, which flows from our Act, to be legally represented.  \n These proceedings are themselves a continuation of proceedings which, with regard to Dr Wouter Basson, commenced on or about the 10th of June 1998 when he was sworn in but before he could evidence various applications were made on his behalf by his legal counsel.  \n One of the intervening circumstances before we could take evidence was an application to the Cape High Court, which was initiated by himself, and a counter-application which was brought in by the Commission, the outcome of which the court order was issued with various reliefs to the Commission, the essence of which was to dismiss his application and to order him to appear before us today to answer all questions lawfully put to him.\n We are, therefore, in the continuation of those proceedings which, as I have said, commenced on the day when we were to take evidence from Dr Wouter Basson in June 1998.\n A very passionate plea, both by himself and by his legal counsel, or legal representative today, has been made on the basis that, if for no other reason but for the reason that our Act entitles him to legal representation it would be unfair if he were not to be represented, preferably by legal counsel of his choice, but certainly by competent legal representatives who would be able to represent his best interests on the merits.\n Mr van Niekerk has indicated that he himself is neither competent, by reason of the fact that he has not taken any full instructions, nor able and ready to represent Dr Wouter Basson on the merits, clearly by reason of the fact that in terms of the legal ethics that govern the conduct of attorneys, it would be unimaginable that he should even pretend to be representing somebody from whom he has not been able to take instructions.\n This panel takes the points, they are very sympathetic.  Against their own will they indicated that it may well be that in the interests of fairness, and in the interests of justice Dr Wouter Basson should be granted a postponement.  \n It is in accordance with the exercise of his legal and Constitutional rights that on a plea for a postponement on the grounds advanced this panel should be inclined and keen to grant him a postponement.\n I had occasion during the course of the proceedings to remark that no rights are absolute, and I think the panel has to weigh sometimes, as most tribunals have had to do, and as most courts have had to do, competing rights. The Constitution has or the Act has in the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act has a duty to do certain things, one of which is to carry out the mandate of the Commission.  The particular Committee vested with the duty to take evidence on perpetration of gross violations of human rights and matters incidental thereto is the Human Rights Violations Committee.  Its mandate ends on Friday.  \n There are certain obligations on it and whilst we appreciate the inference to be drawn from Dr Wouter Basson's interventions, namely that we have been dealing with him since August 1997 or 1996 for that matter, and therefore we had plenty of opportunity to have engaged with him, the fact of the matter is that on the 29th of July 1998 we have not so engaged with him and we have only the following two days to do so.\n We would therefore urge with every sympathy that we have shown, but with everything at our command, that he should utilise the remaining part of today and endeavour to get either legal representation or the legal representatives of his own choice as he has indicated, or such legal representatives as will be able to come and represent him on the merits tomorrow at 9 o'clock, which is the date on which we have agreed the matter must be postponed to.\n May I just add in parenthesis that these proceedings are not proceedings in a court of law, this is a tribunal, it is one that has been set up in terms of Section 29 on the basis of which we subpoenaed Dr Wouter Basson.  I will have more to say about the validity of that subpoena when later on during the course of these proceedings I deal with the question of whether or not Dr Wouter Basson was contemptuous of this court when he arrived as he did at a quarter past nine.  These are matters that we still will reserve until we are in a position to do so at the tail end of these proceedings.  \n I might just remark that in connection with the postponement, it is to tomorrow at 9 o'clock in this room or such time at 9 o'clock.  I have to emphasise that we will reluctantly have to proceed tomorrow whether or not Dr Wouter Basson is legally represented.   We will now adjourn until 9 o'clock tomorrow.\nHEARING ADJOURNS",
