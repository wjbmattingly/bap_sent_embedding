If you look at the previous minutes Mr Vally, dated the 9th of January - oh no, I beg your pardon, that's not right, let me just get back to that one, when the substances were destroyed, the substances we discussed yesterday, there was a requirement both from the Auditor General as to the value of the substances that had been destroyed.  For that we had to obtain a value certificate, which I think is added or is attached to the destruction certificate and which ultimately led to General Meiring having to submit to the Auditor General a letter in which he says what the true value was.  That is attached to the documents here and I think you may have seen it.\n At the same time the Attorney General's office, as far as I can recall, required about the destruction and whether we could provide the necessary report.  If you look at the minutes of January '95 which follows the meeting that you are referring to you will see that we were still waiting for a written report from the police so that we could provide ultimately a complete report to the Attorney General.

            "No, Mr Vally.  The Defence Force has contracts with numerous private companies that provides technology and provides equipment etc., to the  Defence Force.  The fact that Protechnic was a specialised company in terms of the development of detection apparatus, decontamination apparatus, evaluating masks and filters and so on, obviously made it a primary company for the use of the Defence Force.\n When it was taken over by Mr Zimmer and Mr van Remoortere who also testified here, it was then a totally private company where that type of expertise and, the main client of that company was the Defence Force certainly and the Defence Force had contracts with them.\n What happened then was, Protechnic was considering closing down because the Defence Force requirement was reducing, it was becoming less than what it had been before.  We had established the technology, we had established the state of the art standardisation techniques for masks, filters, decontamination etc., etc.  And they were considering closing down.  \n I then went to Armscor and said we cannot afford to lose this expertise that we have in that company.  I recommended to the Co-ordinating Management Committee that we should persuade Armscor to take over this company.  The New Chemical Weapons Convention makes provision for any country in the world that is a State party to that convention to have what is described in the Convention as a single small scale facility which can continue to do the type of research to keep ahead with the state of the art equipment in terms of masks and filters and decontamination and clothing and that sort of thing.   \n That was what was taking place here.  Armscor had agreed that they would go into a negotiating phase with Mr van Remoortere and they had come to an agreement about the payment and they took over the company and from that moment onwards the company was registered as the single small scale facility of South Africa in terms of the New Chemical Weapons Convention, and was so declared.\n And in fact very quickly after the Convention entered into force, the Convention entered into force in March/April last year, if I remember correctly it was the 28th of April and very soon thereafter the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons did an inspection at Protechnic in terms of the requirements of the Convention, gave them a positive report and soon after that, during November of last year, Protechnic transferee to new premises just outside Pretoria as a subsidiary now of Armscor and they were reinvestigated, reinspected by the OPCW and again given a positive certificate.\n So what is reflected here is the process of where I'm being made aware, and Mr van Remoortere spoke to me personally and said: \"I'm considering selling this company, I'm not getting enough business and I've lost interest in this area of expertise, what should I do\"? And I said: \"I will bring you into touch with Armscor and you start negotiating with them\".  And this is what is reflected here.",

            "That list, from A to G were the front companies that had been approved for that year by the Minister.  If you look at the bottom, paragraph 5, it says\n\"During 1990 one of the previous front companies namely Delta G, has been privatised and is now no longer a front company\"\n So what I'm trying to explain to you is that on an annual basis, in terms of this project, we had to get approval through the office of the Chief of the Defence Force and through his Chief of Staff Finance, which is a laid down procedure within the Defence Force, to obtain approval by the Minister for front companies.  \n I also have a letter here which you do not have in your possession which is of the previous year, where Delta G is still included as one of the front companies, but in that year the privatisation process began to take place and the privatisation process is explained in a very lengthy letter which you do not have in your possession but which is now in the possession of the Auditor General and of OSEO, in which the Minister and the Minister of Finance approved the process that was going to be followed to privatise both Delta G initially and later on Roodeplaat and some of the others later on as well.\n That led to the directors, basically the directors of those companies with a shareholding in the company, taking over the control over the company and controlling it through a holding company.  What Doctor Mijburgh said yesterday was essentially true.  The Medchem Technologies that he had established was the holding company as he explained.\n The briefing to the Minister of Defence, Annexure H, which is now a year later in August '93, if you look at the attachment to that briefing: \"Aanhangsel A\", I'm giving the Minister a summary there of what the situation was with regards to front companies and I said: \"This is the chronological history of each of these companies and how they developed, there is the history of Delta G: \n\"Founded April 1992\n Plant opened Midrand '85\n Company sold to employees in 1991\n Last contracts finalised March '93\n Final transfer of share certificates 1993\"\nCan you see, that reflects the process.  Roodeplaat the next one:\n\"Roodeplaat founded in 1981\n Sold to management\nFinal transfer 31 March\n Infradel, Sefmed, D John Truter\"\nAnd that is where the list ends.  Which again reflects to you which were the major or front companies that had been established with State funds.  \n And if you then look further it says:\n\"Other Companies\"\nAnd it mentions:\n\"Lifestyle Management, Protechnic Laboratories and Technotec\"\nwhich were private companies and that I say very clearly there:\n\"They were however never owned by the SADF\"\nNow this is why I've been trying to say to you from the start that Protechnic was a private company.  I've been reflecting on this, you must understand I took over as Surgeon General in 1988, this is how it was transmitted to me, conveyed to me and I had no reason to doubt it and I reported as such to the Minister.\n In view of what you've asked me and in view of the other testimony that was given here I can see that it is possible that SRD was a front company which Jan Lourens I think gave testimony to that effect, it then changed its name to Protechnic, it may still have been a front company then but at a certain stage it was taken over by van Remoortere and Zimmer and it was then a private company.  And certainly when I was Surgeon General and I had to co-ordinate or manage the project I saw that as a private company.  There's nothing sinister about that.\n Now to come back to your question, this list that you've just started reading from with 102 names on it, I assure you the only companies on this list that were front companies were those reflected on the documents that I've now referred to you.  All the others were established by individuals as explained by Doctor Mijburgh.  What I think happened here is when the privatisation was taking place, when it became clear to the two main companies, we're really talking about Delta G mainly and Roodeplaat, those directors of those companies had to find another area where they could carry on with their business and they established these companies.  \n Let me tell you National Intelligence at the moment is conducting a full investigation into even other names that are not included on this list, and so is the office of Serious Economic Offences.  They are extremely interested to see what had happened to all of these companies.\n My own knowledge of them is really of such a nature that I can't give you any further information.  I can simply confirm to you that none of the others on this list, except the ones I've given you on the reference, were front companies of the Defence Force.",

I can't remember which document it was but it was one of the bundle, where I made the testimony that a Counter Intelligence Report was drawn up by the staff of the Chief of Staff Intelligence.  In that document you will see one or two or three of these other companies are investigated, I think Aeromed was one.\n I certainly knew in 1991 that there was an investigation into the so-called Aeromed Services, on the basis that there were links with members of the Project Coast.  After that investigation had been completed I was assured that there was no criminal activities discovered and that the case was closed.   From then onwards I had no further knowledge until I received the first letter from the Offices of Serious Economic Offences in January '93, which is in my bundle here and you will also see what my reply was to that.  In that letter from the Offices of Serious Economic Offences, there are also a number of these additional companies mentioned.  We can go to it if you like but I don't waste time, but not nearly as many as we have on the list now.\n The next step was when we started working closely with National Intelligence.  I explained already how that had taken place and when I began to link up with National Intelligence, not necessarily Mr Mike Kennedy but some of his other colleagues assisted me in helping the Office of Serious Economic Offences in trying to unravel what the position was here.\n I must admit that it was only last year when I visited the offices of National Intelligence that I became aware of a document which I happen to have here, on companies associated or linked in some or other way to Project Coast.

            "No, Sir.  Let me try and give you the background there.  There are, as far as I can remember, 13 CD Rom optic discs in the safe.  After the technical information was transferred from documents onto the discs, the discs were brought to me by Colonel Ben Steyn in a safe.  I established that the discs were inside the safe, and as far as I remember there's also an additional floppy along with it, which is the access mechanism, access coding that you require to be able to access the information on the discs.\n It was then put into a very large wall safe attached to my office and my headquarters and only Colonel Steyn and I had control, joint control over the small safe, smaller safe, the portable safe.  After the demarche and particularly after the Americans and the British expressed concern about the safety of the information on the discs, I went to see Mr de Klerk and I followed it up with a letter and that letter I can give you a copy of.  It was in April 1994.  \n At that stage we changed the joint control in such a way that all three of us, the President, Mr de Klerk, Colonel Steyn and myself had to be present in order to access or to be able to open the small safe.  The position was then changed, it was then changed to a safe in a different part of my headquarters, a huge safe with two keys and a combination and the small safe with its two keys was put into the bigger safe.  \n And in that joint control we gave the President one of the keys of the big safe as well as the combination of the big safe.  I kept the key of the big safe and one of the keys of the small safe.  Colonel Steyn had the combination of the big safe and the other key of the small safe, and that was how that situation was maintained.\n The discs were never accessed, although we recommended to the previous government and to the present government, particularly with regards to the investigation of both the d'Oliviera Commission as well as of the Offices of Serious Economic Offences, that at some or other time we would have to access the information on those discs.\n After the withdrawal of Mr de Klerk from the government of national unity obviously the situation changed.  Let me just say this, after we briefed Mr Mandela in August '94 and explained the security measures to him, he indicated that we should maintain it as it is at that time.  \n In other words that Mr de Klerk should still retain his part of the control.  But when Mr, and I beg your pardon, when Mr Mandela met the overseas delegation from the USA and the UK, the whole question of the security of that information was again discussed with them and they expressed their approval of the system which was in place and it was maintained exactly in that way.  And then when Mr de Klerk withdrew from the government of national unity, I indicated to him that he would have to give up his part of the control and hand it over to either Mr Mandela or Mr Mbeki.  That ultimately took place and at the present time the control is exactly the same with present Surgeon General having the position that I had, with Colonel Steyn still being in the office there as the past Project Officer and still the expert on chemical and biological defence and I believe Mr Mbeki now has the further control.\n But the answer to your question is, the information has not been accessed ever, although may I just add this, when we discovered or when the trunks were discovered with information on it, a lot of files on it, the files that we are dealing with at the moment, both National Intelligence and I recommended strongly to government that we should access the information, because if we access that information we can then deal with what was the official project programme as I've been describing it to you up to now and what was outside that programme.

I may just mention that the company that had carried out this task, as far as I could establish afterwards, was given a contract by D John Truter in 1991, to establish a data base for the project.\n The decision that all the technical information of those two companies, we're talking mainly about Delta G and Roodeplaat, that that should be put on discs was confirmed by Mr Louw, the Minister of Defence in January '93.  The company had already had a contract.  I was not even aware which company was involved but the work had been done, it took almost a year for it to be completed.  You see we are here dealing with a minute of January '94 so that's a year later.\n When the trunks were discovered and I was invited by National Intelligence along with Colonel Steyn to come an evaluate the contents of the trunks, I immediately realised that those trunks contained most of the research, technical information of research carried out at Roodeplaat.  There was some of Delta G but you will agree with me it's mainly Roodeplaat work.  And my first question was, these are the documents that were supposed to have been destroyed and which we had reported here that all technical documents had been destroyed.  \n And that was when I started asking questions of National Intelligence and I can confirm that in June last year, the trunks were discovered February/March last year, in June last year when we were discussing the technical information on the documents vis-a-vis the technical information that was supposed to be on the discs, that I was informed by National Intelligence that this was in fact done by Data Imaging Information Services.

Now during this hearing we've had very eminent scientists coming and speaking, the very people who were actually - Dr Basson was not a Microbiologist at the end of the day.  Was there every any thought given to the posing the question that, let's go to the actual people who were the heads of the various departments, the Dr van Rensburgs, the Dr Immelmans, to ask them - even Dr Steyn, I mean yes, he's the project co-ordinator now, Dr Basson was a project co-ordinator.  But was there ever any thought given to that idea, to bring a team of people, I'm talking about at the time, because they were really the individuals who knew.  When Dr - it's a question I'm going to come back to later on in terms of the fertility programme - you know, Dr Basson knew nothing about that, let's be honest about it.  Yes he's a chemist, but he knew nothing about what the lady doctor was doing within that programme.  Now that would have been the sort of cross-checking I suppose that we would have expected, and that's what our concern is about at the moment.  Now was there any thought at that time, besides giving it to Dr Bothma and Dr Steyn and Dr Basson, to bring these very eminent individuals in.  Let's leave Professor Falck out, he wasn't even part of your thinking at the time.",

            "Dr Randera, I'm trying to answer you question.  The project started in 1981.  The system and the way it was co-ordinated and controlled was established from then onwards.  By 1988 that system was working and was running with good security and it was handed over to me as a successful way of conducting the project.  In other words, for 8 years it had run that fashion.  I was briefed and I asked the question, have we achieved out objectives and I was satisfied that we had.  I immediately said, in that case we can now begin the following process, namely the process of privatising, commercialising, normalising and looking after these scientists.  We had a large number of very eminent scientists, as you correctly say, that we had to look after.  I explained - I think you heard what I said yesterday, that I was initially opposed and I was told that we cannot terminate it at that stage.  I was in favour of the fact that it could be not terminated, but scaled-down to the level where the maintenance of the capability could be maintained.  That only took place about two years later when it was agreed that now the process of privatisation and commercialisation could take place.\n So within three years of me taking over as Surgeon-General, this is where we are now.  I'm saying again, with the wisdom of hindsight it might have been a good idea to do what you are suggesting.  But let me just say something else to you, within those years, the eight years and the three years, a number of our staff that were associated with the project became knowledgeable.  One of them was Dr Brian Davie.  Dr Brian Davie fulfilled the role as the technical advisor to myself for a while, but because of the important role that he was beginning to play in support of foreign affairs and in support of the development of a Non-proliferation Council, the beginnings of the new act, Non-proliferation Act.  He was very quickly scooped up as it were by the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons, where he is today, working as a director.  He was one of the persons who could have been a great help.  The minute he was scooped up by the OPCW, Colonel Steyn was the next one that stepped into that position.  And today I am sitting with exactly the same situation, or rather the present Surgeon-General is sitting with the same situation.  At the very moment Colonel Steyn is in Geneva attending the conference of the Biological Weapons Convention in support of foreign affairs and giving advice to them as to the working papers, as to the friend of the chair meetings, as to the resolutions that South Africa is submitting.  We have only two people that really would be in the position to help us, all the others as has been pointed out here by Mr Vally, has resigned from the Defence Force, has been embroiled in other companies or has left the country, and as he correctly says, some of them have gone to Canada.",

This impression was further strengthened by the detailed document of the US and UK governments, dated 11th of April 1994.\"\nNow, that's February 1994, and you're very concerned about Dr Basson's credibility.  You know that your knowledge of what was or was not put on the discs came from Dr Basson.  But if you look at J5, which is the minutes of the Co-ordinating Committee of the 9th of January 1995, under the paragraph 3 where it says \"Datavaslegging\" with reference, I assume, to the optical discs that you talked about.  It says \"afgehandel\", concluded.  My question is, because you became aware and were concerned about the role played by Dr Basson, didn't you think it was necessary to re-visit the issue of what he had told you he had put onto the discs?",

            "Mr Vally, remember this is a - in fact this was the final Co-ordinating Management Committee, it didn't have a function any further.  With regards to the project, that component had been completed.  By this time the discussion about the documents and about the control over them and about the demarche and about the position of Dr Basson was at the level of Government.  I have said to you that we discussed this after the briefing I had from National Intelligence, along with Mr Coetzee, we discussed it during the demarche with the President, with the Chief of the Defence Force at that time, General Meiring, and with the Minister.  That was already in February '94.  After the election we had to wait quite a while before they had the opportunity to brief Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki and Mr Modise, Mr Kasrils, that had been done in August '94.  At that stage both I myself and Mr Mike Kennedy as you see from his own affidavit had regular meetings with the President and the Deputy President together and separately, and we had discussions, some of which were formal discussions of which minutes were produced, some were informal discussions.  And the main issue then, as I explained in my affidavit, was to deal with the demarche because this had international relations implications and proliferation implications, and to deal with Basson separately.  And we did, we did - at that meeting when I briefed President Mandela, we discussed the position of Dr Basson personally, and at that point we had agreed, both I and National Intelligence informed President Mandela, in front of President De Klerk that his initial dismissal founded on or based on the Steyn Report, was in fact an unfair dismissal, he had never been charged with anything, he'd never been given a chance to give an explanation.  He should have been given that opportunity, or he should have been placed in a position where he could be questioned properly.  The only persons who had any dealing with Basson directly was myself and Mr Kennedy of National Intelligence.  And on the basis of what he said to the President they had agreed to satisfy the concerns of the Americans and the British, to re-apply him on permanent basis.  For that we had to apply to the Commission for Administration to do that, because a person who is on pension cannot just simply be taken back on a permanent appointment.  The Commission for Administration took almost a year before they acceded to our recommendation - in fact Mr Mbeki personally had to go and see the Commission for Administration in order to be able to get him re-appointed.\n So concerned were they about the control over Dr Basson, over his movements and so on.  But the point that I'm trying to make, Mr Vally, is all of us, I put it in my affidavit, at that point everything I knew, everything that I was concerned about was shared with the President and the Minister and the Chief of Defence Force.  It was not any longer at the level of a Co-ordinating Management Committee to make a decision.  So from the point of view of what they could have done at this which turned out to be the last meeting, was nothing, it was rather at the level of the Chief of Defence Force, the Minister and the President.",

So within that Committee there were really two or three of us who had full background information and knew that there were investigations going on, that there was a question mark, certainly as far as financial management was concerned, and the possible financial abuses.  General Meiring was present at the meeting with the State President, Mr Coetzee in the demarche in February in - where my comments on the American report was tabled and so, so clearly he had exactly the same information that I had, I had kept him up to date.  In my affidavit I arranged for him to also be seen - or also to see myself and Mr Mike Kennedy, and that happened in '94, but also in '95, '96, later on.

            "Dr Randera, you're quite right, I don't think the questions are unfair, and in your position I would ask the same type of questions, but let me say this, you're quite right - before I became Surgeon-General in 1987 I raised my first concern to General Geldenhuys with the fact that I became aware of the fact that Wouter Basson was getting instructions, not related to the project necessarily, but just in the broadest possible way, getting instructions and acting as an advisor to other Commanding Officers, to other organisations, even at the Departments without the knowledge, the apparent knowledge of the Surgeon-General.  I raised that in 1987.  When I became Surgeon-General I again put that question to them, and I've already testified to that.  So you're right, clearly it disturbed me that there was not sufficient control.\n May I, if you will allow me to say to you, it is at the present time still a major problem.  The - my successor says the same to me, he says, I don't have control over people under my command, they are being seen directly by, and he names all sorts of people.  And I say to him, now you will understand the position that I found myself in.  \n Now when we come to conclusions of this hearing, I think the one thing that stands out, is that the dilemma we had with this highly technical type project, which requires a detailed knowledge of chemistry, and as you pointed out, also of other fields like Microbiology and Toxicology, etc, that you end up totally relying on one individual who has a lot of freedom of movement and has the support not only of his own Commander or channel of command, but also of other command channels.  That is the dilemma.  I really don't know how one overcomes that, how - you know it's not a good thing to run a project through a Committee in any case, in my opinion, it's better to have a one person responsibility, but because of the complexity, both on the financial side, both from the security side and of the scientific side, this is how it was constructed and I can assure you, if you come in as a new Commanding Officer of an arm of service, and you inherit a system which is believed to work and which is believed to succeed, it's virtually impossible to change that.",

It operated as a private company, it was fully integrated in chemical community where it operated undercover successfully till the programme was stopped.\"\nParagraph 39,\n\"Chemical agents were categorised as lethal, incapacitating and irritating agents.\"\nUnder paragraph 40,\n\"Lethal agents, these agents were considered to be those that had been developed exclusively for use as lethal chemical agents in weapons of war.  It was apparent at a very early stage of our research, but there was no sense in trying to develop and study molecules that were more toxic that those already known in the field.  Those molecules were an adequate deterrent even though they had been around for many years.  What was important is that new delivery and penetration enhancement techniques have made protection against these agents vastly more difficult.  Following philosophy regarding these agents was developed and implemented.  All known molecules in this group would be synthesised on lab scale.  This was followed by confirmatory investigation of the chemical and toxicological properties of the molecules.  Further research would be done on the various penetration enhancement techniques applied to these molecules.  All substances in the above findings will be made available to the Defensive Equipment Research Programme and no weaponisation would be implemented for any of these.\"\nI think I give you more details of that later on, let me just make sure.

            "Mr Vally, what I find very unfair is that you are trying to indicate that the final decision and the final management was in the hands of one person, that is not true.  It was a Co-ordinating Management Committee under the chairmanship of the Chief of the Defence Force.\n In terms of that management he had available to him the Chief of Staff Finance, the Chief of Staff Intelligence, the Chief of Staff Logistics, the Chief of the Army, the Commanding General of Special Forces, later on the Chief of the Airforce and when it was required, also the Chief of Staff Planning and the Chief of Staff and one of these incumbents was also General Steyn.\n Now the Surgeon General was there from a point of view that the scientists that was control of the Project Officer and the Project Officer himself, the Project Officer was a member of the medical services and the management was then entrusted to my predecessor, the Surgeon General.\n This project had run for eight years and it achieved all the objectives that it had set out to achieve.  We spoke very little in this hearing about any of the achievements.  I'm constantly reminded that it cost the State a lot of money and what have we got to show for it.  You've not paid any attention to the defensive equipment that had been developed, to the detection apparatus, to the decontamination apparatus as well as the decontamination substance.\n You've spent a lot of time saying how irresponsible it is to use CR.  Some of the scientists have said CR remains in the area where you apply it, that's why the decontamination fluid was developed to ensure that that problem would not arise.  You don't say any word about that.  You indicate that you believe that these records that we have may contain nothing.  I've indicated to you that I've recommended the government a number of times that we should access that information so that we can see how valuable it really is.  And I've said to government that that's a national asset of strategic importance that we cannot destroy and we will not, at the behest of the Americans or the British, get rid of, it's too important for us.\n You don't mention anything about the knowledge and the learning process that we had in advising the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Trade and Industry with regard to the implications of the various Conventions, with regard to the legislation of this country, with regard to inspections, with regard to declarations.  \n You don't pay any attention to the important role that South Africa now plays within these two conventions and the respect that they have been dealt with in the international arena where they are giving impetus to new developments in terms of these conventions.  I'm not only referring to those two conventions, I'm referring to the Convention on Anti-personnel Mines.  You think that all of those things just come out of the air.   You don't pay any attention to the fact that one of the officers who served in the medical services is now sitting on the OPCW and playing a very important role there.  \n You don't pay any attention to the development of a 7th Medical Battalion Group which is a quick reaction group and which has saved lives in this country on a number of occasions because of the fact that they had developed in the way they had with parachuting and free falling and having special medical bags and the skills and the planning skills to do operations and to do the necessary planning for a disaster situation.  All of that you think just happens.  All of this developed at the same time when we were busy with this project.  \n In fact the whole 7th Medical Battalion Group has been so discredited that all those members have resigned and are now sitting either overseas or in some of these companies that you've been harping upon this morning.  I think it's very unfair to now hamper or pay attention only to one aspect, mainly the irresponsibility.\n I have admitted to this hearing on a number of occasions with the wisdom of hindsight I might have acted differently.  But you don't give me any leeway in understanding how it works in the hierarchy of the Defence Force where the Surgeon General is part of the team and where he is under the command of the Chief of the Defence Force and where any type of action that you seem to expect me to have done, could have led to somebody simply saying: \"We don't need you anymore, get out, we don't need you around\".  You've got to understand that but you're not understanding that.\n I dare to ask you if in this Commission members of the Commission know exactly what is happening at the level of research and development of your own researchers.  Are all those records made available, do they ...[indistinct].  I've heard your Chairman testifying in George that he didn't have the time to read the report that Mr Botha put in.  I've heard from members of this Committee that they haven't had time to read the Cloud Report which was drawn up exactly with the purpose to inform you fully of all the circumstances that existed and to inform government of all the existing circumstances so that you would have a total understanding of our programme.\n I've given a briefing to Mr Mandela which you have and I've given the summary of the two transparencies that I've shown you, and in that is shown all the equipment that we had at that time, masks and filters and detection apparatus and decontamination and clothing etc., etc.  You've heard testimony that that is being sought after by the countries that were involved in the gulf war, which gave a lot of credit to South Africa's position.  What more can I say to you than what I've been testifying in the last few days?  I've admitted that is I'd had the wisdom of hindsight I would have acted differently.\n I made a briefing to the TRC on the medical services in totality earlier last year, in May last year, and in that briefing I said that I was not aware of any activity within the medical service as an organisation which in any way I need to be ashamed about in terms of their ethics and their moral standards and the service that they had delivered.\n I've drawn up a code of conduct for that service of which I'm extremely proud and I said so here in public.  What I also said was that I regretted the fact that the type of hearing that took place led to a discreditation of the entire organisation and to a loss of manpower and loss of expertise which we will never ever be able to replace.\n You've made mention of the fact that we may have potentially proliferated.  I'm saying much of what has come out of this hearing has contributed to proliferation and will undoubtedly contribute to our international relations being jeopardised and I've said so to Mr Mbeki last week and he agreed with me.  I just want to say this ...[intervention]",

            "Possibly he will have come and testify here if he says that because you know he was very well represented here by lawyers who haven't really projected that image to us.  If anything the lawyers who represented Mbeki and his government have given us an indication that that office is very pleased about the way in which we have handled these hearings.  We don't regret having taken the decision that we took.\n And quite frankly General Knobel, you know the more I hear you speak the more I distressed I personally become because you, inasmuch as you seem to say we do not appreciate the good things that the project was all about, it seems to me you do not appreciate what the Commission is about.  \n The Commission was not set to discover how good South African was in the past, it has a specific mandate to examine amongst other things but more particularly perpetration of gross violations of human rights in the context of looking at the motives and perspectives, the antecedents, the context, but with a clear mandate to look at violations of human rights.\n It may well be that the CBW programme, and at this stage I'm not even making a decision because the panel has got to do that, but it may well be that it did all the good things that it did and I don't think there is anyone here who is going to gainsay that but the fact of the matter is that your scientists came and sat here and testified about the other things that they did which you yourself are admitting ought not to have been done and that is unfortunately what we are here about.  We are not here to say because 90% or even 99% of the work that was done by the CBW programme was advancing the interest of science and technology in this country, then we should ignore the 1%, we would fail in our duty.  \n It is not about whether or not the percentages were 80/20, 70/30, 99 to 1%, it is about the fact that if all this evidence points to us being satisfied that things that have been testified about here are in fact capable of being concluded to have happened, it is about whether or not any decent society should have had those aspects of technology being used in the advancement of those objectives.\n If we come to the conclusion at the end that even though 80% of the work that was done by that programme was good, was well intentioned, advanced in the ways in which you have said, it advanced the image of this country, we will not because the 20% of it is making us a prier in the world of today, we should not refrain from making those conclusions.\n So it really is not about whether or not, it's the same thing we hear now and every day: apartheid was not so bad, we produced the best schools, Stellenbosch, Pretoria, we produced professors in all fields of human endeavour.  Yes, that is true but again we produced the worst of schools, we produced the worst of universities some people were denied by virtue of that same ideology of becoming the best that society could have produced.\n So please, let us, especially if that is your contribution to what the question to you, it is certainly not a contribution.  You are being asked about a specific aspect, what do you consider your contribution or lack thereof to have been in that part of that CBW programme which to us appears to have been obnoxious in the extreme, to have been intended for purposes for which that programme had not been set.\n Don't tell us about the good thing, we all know them, we accept them.  Take it for granted that we accept and we laud them for what they were but what is your responsibility when once you discover that there was such a horrifying programme that that man was at the head of.  What is your contribution?  Do you feel remorseful about not having acted and acted strongly enough in order to counter what he was doing?  In fact, did it ever strike you that you may have had to apply for amnesty for your role in being part and parcel of that machinery?  If you feel that you didn't have to apply for amnesty, that you have nothing to be apologetic about then say so but don't please let us weigh in terms of which was more advancing the interest of this country and which not because we are going to forecast on that which should not have happened.

We dealt with about 40 pharmaceutical companies, recognised pharmaceutical companies in the country who supplied us with all the necessary pharmaceutical needs that we had.\n The Surgeon General had a certain responsibility in terms having on the shelves supplies that would last this country for a minimum period of three months or in some cases six months, of certain pharmaceutical products, particularly those that deal with malaria or those diseases that tend to come in epidemic natures and obviously with the possibility of being isolated in terms of its pharmaceutical needs, the Surgeon General had that kind of responsibility.

General Niewoudt was on that Committee and when I became\nSurgeon General I was also appointed in that capacity as a representative of the Department of Defence, in fact in representing the Minister on that Committee.\n On that Committee the whole question of the population explosion was constantly being discussed and the water supplies of the country and the infrastructure that had to carry this population.  Things like the illegal immigrants coming into the country and the very large population that had to be carried by the resources of this country.  \n As was testified here by Doctor van Rensburg if I remember rightly and I read it, he indicated that the World Health Organisation had indicated that there would be a use for a vaccine that could have an effect on population development.  So to come to your question - I see you're getting agitated, I was informed when I became Surgeon General, that my predecessor had approved that a commercial project could be carried out at Roodeplaat and I have indicated to you that commercial ventures were allowed, that they could study fertility and they could study the possibility of developing a male contraceptive pill as well as a vaccine.  And that that was done, the information I had does not concur with what was testified here, the information was that this could be done for the People's Republic of China in exchange for technology that would be made available ...[indistinct].

And you are a scientist  yourself, not in the sense of a Brigadier Basson or Immelman, you were an anatomist, Professor of Anatomy before you joined the Medical Services, joined the Army.  I suppose I'd like you to comment:  1. On this issue of scientists in the past and how they became involved, because we're trying to understand institutes as well.  More specifically I want to understand your own, because I think the Chairperson said earlier on: \"What responsibility are you taking yourself\", your own thinking and your own psyche at the time in becoming not only involved in the Defence Force, and I take, I mean I heard you very clearly when you spoke at the Medical Hearings on the pride that you take on what was achieved by SAMS, but nonetheless we were involved in a conflict in this country, you were part of that conflict, pre 1994 and so I'm trying to understand your own role and your own thinking.

            "Doctor Randera, in my briefing to the TRC on the programme I went out of my way to try and clarify my initial position and why I became involved with the medical service in general.  I can sum it up by saying that I initially did not want to join the permanent force because I was quite happy in the academic environment and I was making a contribution in the citizen force.\n However, my predecessor had been battling to separate the medical service from the army and the airforce and the navy and creating a separate arm of service which is unique in the world.  Today there are quite a number of countries that have followed suite but at that time it was totally unique.  He inspired me with a missionary zeal to help him to establish that and the emphasis at the time was to create for ourselves our own image, our own ethic, our own code of conduct, our own uniform, our own budget, our own command and control system.\n All of that had been achieved, but one of the issues that was very strongly conveyed to me, that as an academic I had to bring in the academic approach to elevate what was basic military training, with military emphasis, with military requirements and with typical military disciplinary code as being the guiding line.  I had to bring into it the professional code, the code of conduct of the various professional statutory bodies and to write a code of conduct for this which was a unique situation, a professional person in uniform.\n That process took at least 15 years.  And that is really the process that I tried to convey to the TRC at my last briefing, which I was very proud of.  Every profession, there are 27 statutory professions in the medical service, every profession has had designed for themselves a caduceus which they wear to comply with the requirements of the International Red Cross recommendations in terms of the Geneva Conventions.\n Every bit of conduct within the military environment in uniform, but in the uniform of the medical service, is designed to comply with the Geneva Conventions with relation to the conduct of medical personnel.  \n Having listed to this hearing, having heard what we've heard with regards to what I intend to submit to you are mavericks in the organisation, has horrified me and I'm very distressed by it and I'm absolutely in total agreement that whatever comes out of this hearing, one of the things that should come out of it is how do you prevent this sort of thing happening again, without losing what has been established on the positive side.  I would feel very, very, distressed if we lose what is on the positive side because of what is emerging on a negative scale.  That I would like to make a contribution to prevent from happening.  \n I will say this, and I've heard testimony by a number of the other witnesses, as far as the ethics and the morals are concerned I can see no difficulty with the Surgeon General been given the responsibility of being involved or even co-ordinating a project which will ensure that the medical personnel act within international conventions and accepted international conduct. \n We've had discussions here about whether CR, is it right to develop something like CR.  You've heard the answers, people have said it's much better to use something that will either incapacitate or subdue a crowd rather than shooting them.  I feel the same way.  I feel the same way about the carrying of weapons.  It is true that the medical service carried weapons but strictly according to the conditions as set out in the Geneva Convention, to protect themselves and to protect their patients.  \n The Geneva Convention states very clearly: if there is an international conflict and a declaration of war, those conventions apply fully but they also recognise that there are other conflict situations which is not an open declaration of war and where circumstances prevail where the position of the medical personnel is different.\n I've considered all of that and I have constantly been measuring the medical service against that, particularly in our situation and what we used to call: \"the bush war\" and within the internal environment.  \n I'm distressed with you about the possibilities that have come out here about the indications, I've admitted to that.  I think the biggest dilemma and I've said that before this morning, the biggest dilemma is that we have found ourselves in a position where we only had one person with the very wide powers of self decision making, freedom of movement and the only person who had all the skills and knowledge of this very, very complex programme.

However you are right, I am concerned about that today.\n I must however say that I also share the view of Lieutenant General Neethling when he said that the tablets that we were talking about, I think it was 200 000 tablets, that really is not all that many tablets.  What I am concerned about is if a thousand kilograms of substance were then converted into tablets, that would be a major problem.  I'm not sure if we have proved that Advocate Potgieter.  We've indicated that there is such a possibility and I'm gravely concerned about it, that I would admit.",

We all knew that at some or other point there was going to be a new Convention and we would have to rethink the position of retaliation.  We all knew that, we said that, we advised government in that regard.\n You know today we are sitting with a very large quantity of CR both weaponised and non-weaponised and it is being maintained at the instruction ...[intervention]",

I was the one who said to the President: \"You cannot trust the finding of these two demarches\", because it was really one demarche but two different governments that they were dealing with.  I agree fully with what the Chairman says there and I advised government accordingly.\n At the level that I discussed it with the two scientists, and I had them separately in my room, the two of them together separate from the rest of the team, the intelligence people were not there and the Ambassador and the High Commissioner were not there, and then we had a different kind of discussion and I asked them: \"Are you satisfied with the programme that we had an does it make sense\"?   And they both indicated that they were totally satisfied and that it was a very sophisticated programme.  I said so yesterday to Professor Folb, because it was a point that also concerns me, that's why I'm discussing it with him. That's why I'm saying, the use of those substances as potential incapacitating agents is recognised and it's accepted, maybe not by the public or you and I, I agree, but certainly internationally.  \n We have the evidence of General Neethling that they in America even look at LSD as a possibly incapacitating agent.",

            "Well that's it.  It appears to be the conclusion of these proceedings.  Much of what I would have said at the conclusion of everything has already been said in my intervention when Doctor Knobel was saying his piece when in fact he was entitled to say what he wanted to say.\n Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of these proceedings and I think we need to thank everybody who has been party to these proceedings.  It has not been the easiest of proceedings to deal with because of all the sensitivities that attach to dealing as candidly and as openly with a project of this nature but still infusing into that process a responsibility that should make sure that we comply with the duty to inform the public without in a sense throwing out the child with the bath water.\n I'm concerned that it is the view of General Doctor Knobel that those in authority might feel that we have not handled these proceedings in a manner that would obviate proliferation but I would hope that after all is said and done even government will feel that we have tried as much as possible to handle what is really a sensitive programme with care and with sensitivity.\n There are particularly people who I would like to mention even if it is in their absence.  Professor Peter Folb made himself available as a consultant to the TRC at no cost, voluntarily, and that is something that I needs to go into the record as an indication of the preparedness by a number of people to be as helpful to the process as possible.  His expertise has been very helpful to our investigators and it is a matter of gratification to also understand and know that his expertise is acknowledged by his piers in the form of amongst others, General Knobel who himself is an expert in his own field.  We have to thank Professor Folb in his absence and would hope that these remarks will find their way to him as an indication of our appreciation for his services.\n We must also thank particularly the legal representatives of everyone.  We have been engaged in mini battles in the process of these proceedings with some or most of them but it has all been in the spirit of trying to do that which lawyers know best, representing the interest of their clients in the best tradition of their profession.   We would hope that altercations that have taken place in the process of trying to get to the end of these proceedings and revealing the truth will be taken in the spirit in which they were all engaged in.\n We have had to deal with the proceedings on the basis that pending the outcome of the High Court application we will not take in the period allotted to us, in other words today and yesterday, the evidence of Doctor Wouter Basson.  So as far as taking that evidence is concerned it is suspended only to the extent that we will await the outcome of the Court process.\n Speaking for the panel, we are of the view that it is not only in our interest and the interest of society and certainly the interest of the Commission but in the interest of Doctor Wouter Basson himself that his perspective and his testimony should be received.  I know this is a forlorn cry but to the extent that I can persuade from a moral point of view, his lawyers and knowing as I do that colleagues do not give instructions to their clients, they take instructions from their clients but if it is possible and it is within them to persuade him to come and testify, we would ask them to persuade him in the way in which they persuaded Doctor Mijburgh, that it may be in his interest to come and testify and that at the end of the day there is nothing to fear in giving a perspective, especially if that perspective is the truth.\n So we will not take the evidence of Doctor Wouter Basson at this stage but I want to place it on the record that we have not abandoned efforts to take that evidence, and the only intervening circumstance between us and that event is the fact that there is an application which seeks to stop us from taking that evidence.  Of course he can override that by voluntarily deciding at last that he wants to come before us, not only to state his own perspective but also in a large measure to clear his name in those respects where he may unfairly have been prejudiced by either the manner of testimony or some of the things that were said.\n Subject therefore to the recall of Doctor Wouter Basson, these proceedings are adjourned sine die.\nHEARING ADJOURNS",
