            "Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to start.   Once again we welcome everybody to this hearing on the Chemical and Biological Warfare programme, as it has been popularly or notoriously called.  We were taking the evidence of General Knobel, and as I understand the position, we are further going to take the evidence of Dr Wouter Basson and Dr Mijburgh.   There was an indication that an application was going to be made to the High Court by legal representatives representing certainly Dr Wouter Basson, and that we would have received court papers by now in which Dr Wouter Basson's confidence to testify in these proceedings would be placed in issue in view of the fact that he still has to appear on criminal charges in the foreseeable future.  I do not know what the position is, Mr Vally, how you intend to proceed.\n I may just observe in passing that there was a newspaper account of an interview of Dr Wouter Basson which purported to have appeared in Punt Geselsradio, in which he seems to have given a fair amount of testimony about his goings on in the period under consideration by this Commission, and I'm stating that because it seems he's prepared to talk to Punt Geselsradio, if that report is true, and he is ready to come and talk to us.  But I don't want to jump the gun.  \n Mr Vally can you indicate to us what the position is, and then maybe the legal representatives of Dr Wouter Basson if they're here will put us in some position to understand what is going on.  Mr Vally?",

            "Thank you, Mr Chair.  Mr Chair, for the record I want to put the following things - bring the following things to the attention of the panel.\n On the 8th of June 1998 we were advised that Dr Basson wished to make a legal challenge to the ruling that he has to give evidence before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  He was called to give testimony on the 9th of June 1998 and argument was led, and a ruling was made by the panel on the 12th of June 1998, turning down the application of Dr Basson.  After the ruling was given, Advocate Cilliers, counsel for Dr Basson, indicated on the record that a court application on behalf of Dr Basson, at that stage possibly Dr Mijburgh as well, would be prepared within a few days.   On the 15th of June we were advised telephonically that Dr Basson and Dr Mijburgh would not be prepared to testify at the reconvened hearing and that they were in the process of finalising their applications.  We were advised that the applications would be served on us by no later than Thursday 18 June 1998.  \n On the 17th of June 1998 we were advised in writing that they were not in a position - this is - sorry, correspondence with the attorneys, Adolph Malan, of Dr Basson, we were advised that they were not in a position to let us have papers formally by Thursday 18 June, as they were still busy finalising the papers.  We then got an indication that we would receive the final papers by close of business on Friday the 19th of June.  Between the 17th and 18th of June we also were advised that Dr Mijburgh would be prepared to testify and that the legal challenge would only be brought on behalf of Dr Basson.   On the 19th of June we received a fax which advised us that Mr Malan was in Harare at the time and he apologised for not sending us a draft application, he would enquire about this from Carelson and would revert to us.  We asked for the application to be served on us by no later than Monday the 22nd of June.  \n On the 22nd of June we received a telefax which said they would keep us informed as to the progress of the application.  Eventually - I'm just cutting through - we had dealings with them right through, on the 23rd of June, etc.  At some point we received draft papers.  We received initially just a draft founding affidavit on the 24th of June, thereafter on the 29th of June we received a draft notice of motion and draft founding affidavit, neither of which were attested to or issued by any court.  To date we have not received any formal application.  \n Now, we have said in our letter on the 1st of July 1998 that should we not receive any application by the start of the hearing, then we expect Dr Wouter Basson to be present here at this hearing.  We repeated this in a letter dated the 3rd of July 1998 and subsequently as late as the 6th of July 1998 we again pointed out, and I quote from our letter -\n\"Finally we wish to point out that we still have not received the duly issued application on behalf of Dr Basson.  From your correspondence it seems that we should receive this shortly, but we would once again state if we have not received it prior to the commencement of the hearing tomorrow, we will require Dr Basson to be in attendance at the hearing from 09h00 on the 7th of July 1998.  If a booking is required for Dr Basson please contact us at your earliest convenience.\"\nClearly we have not received any application, we've been told for a long time it's imminent.  We have, both at the last hearing and after the ruling by the Commission, requested Dr Wouter Basson's presence here.\n I would ask the panel to formally call Dr Wouter Basson and thereafter we can take any steps necessary if Dr Basson does not accede to our request that he appear before this panel of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

My colleague, Mr Cilliers is also appearing on behalf of Mr Basson, is also present here -I see he's not present at the moment.  He dealt with that aspect, and as far as I know he also had talks with Mr Vally and Mr Chaskalson via my attorney, Mr Malan.  I'm not in a position at this stage to answer, irrespective of what Mr Vally has now put on record since I wasn't involved in those discussions.\n As far as I understand my attorney, Mr Malan, is currently at Silberbauers Attorneys in Cape Town, they're the correspondent attorneys and it is my understanding, and I stand to be corrected, that the application was filed yesterday, but that is second-hand information and I can't vouch for that.  \n Apart from the fact that I also appear on behalf of Mr Basson I am specifically here today to assist Mr Mijburgh in testifying and I would request that if these aspects should be taken further, that as soon as Mr Cilliers is available, and he is present, I'm assuming that he is probably also at the Attorneys at the moment, that the matter regarding Dr Basson then be dealt with later with my colleague, I don't have any specific instructions regarding the position.",

In the circumstances I would like to suggest that it is fair that the position be clarified with Mr Cilliers, he might have facts which I don't have at my disposal and that we at this stage continue with the evidence of Mr Mijburgh, and that when Mr Cilliers becomes available, then that matter in relation to Mr Basson be taken further.  I am not in a position to place any facts on record in respect of the application, the filing of the application and in those circumstances it would be only fair for the situation to be clarified with Mr Cilliers by the panel, and that he should explain to you what the facts are, then you would be in a far better position to make a proper judgement.\n In these circumstances I would like to request that the matter in respect of Mr Basson stand down until later in the day, until Mr Cilliers is present, and that we continue with the evidence of Mr Mijburgh.",

My own impression, and I must state it is a very prima facie impression, I would stand to be persuaded, is that we are being treated with the utmost contempt by Dr Wouter Basson, but then that's a very prima facie impression.\n It is also my impression that if there was any endeavour to treat this panel and the Commission with the respect that I hold they deserve, legal representatives of Dr Wouter Basson would be here to make the explanations that you so endeavour to make.  It's not about whether there is evidence that can be called, it is about whether officers of the court who know their responsibility to this Commission in the same way as they have a responsibility to their clients are here at the time appointed for the resumption of these proceedings.  They are not here, neither is their client.  It's a matter of grave concern.  I just want to note that and place it on record.\n I think Mr Vally's application is validly made and it shall be granted, and Mr Vally if there is anybody here who would go and call Dr Wouter Basson's name outside there three times, I would stand that that should be done.",

Once again I'd to place it on record that, as you've said, your approach is a prima facie one regarding the position of Dr Basson and your other remarks as well.  I would just like to state that it is my submission that you would probably be in a better position to take a view as to this matter once you've been fully briefed.  As far as the presence of Mr Cilliers is concerned, as I understood the arrangement today, was that we would immediately proceed with Dr Mijburgh's evidence.  I did not foresee that the issue of Dr Basson would be immediately taken up.  As I indicated earlier, I wasn't involved in any of the correspondence or arrangements in this regard.",

As far - if Mr Vally's submissions are correct then they will be subject to contestation by the other lawyers, but if on the basis of what he has said, there was a fax yesterday re-emphasising the need for Dr Wouter Basson to be here at 09h00 today in view of the fact that now application has been submitted as had been promised, then we hold that in a very serious light.  But then as I say, subject to whatever submissions they may make subsequently, we may be persuaded otherwise, but at this stage I personally, and I think I speak on behalf of the panel as well, I'm taking the strongest exception to this type of treatment from colleagues.

The context of political conflict in our country. The context of a revolutionary onslaught, Communist onslaught. Which brings me to my first question which is; what was your own understanding of that period and your particular involvement within this whole programme? Because again today we have talked about the defence force but the companies were set up with a specific purpose and that was to develop the chemical and biological warfare programme for South Africa at the time.

I mean the questions have been posed about these capsules that were produced by your company and the possibility that those capsules contained either mandrax or ecstasy. Are these issues that concern you today? That there is a possibility - I am not asking you whether you think it was but are you left with question marks that clearly you haven't been able to give us those questions as the MD of this company?

So in that respect I understood it as that we were rendering a service to the defence force.\n And as I said to Dr Orr just now I didn't have a moral problem with what we were doing at Delta-G in a sense that I felt that although it was quite normally there was a major and emotional outcry regarding chemical and biological warfare those aspects with which we dealt with at Delta made possible more humane warfare in terms of incapacitants and crowd control measures, etc. I hope that answers the question about my own involvement.\n Yes I am surely responsible in the sense that we developed certain substances. I always believed and I never had any reason to doubt that it was a well thought-out  plan of action by the defence force. My contact with the defence whether in my capacity as managing director of Delta-G or otherwise I never thought that we were actually engaged in anything underhand or immoral.\n And then yes as far as the third question is concerned, yes there are certain questions in our minds today.
