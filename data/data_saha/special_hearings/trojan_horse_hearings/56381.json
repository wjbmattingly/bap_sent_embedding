            "Could I continue Chairperson?\n\"I, Douw Vermeulen, hereby state under oath.\nI am an adult male and I am a security advisor and I live in Goodwood.  \nI was approached by the Investigative Unit of the Truth Commission and notified that I would have to appear before the Commission on Monday the 19th of May to give evidence and to answer questions relating to the so-called Trojan Horse incident which took place on the 15th of October 1985 in Athlone, in which Shaun Magmoed, Michael Cheslyn Miranda and Jonathan Claasen died and others were injured\".\nI will now just mention that I was also subpoenaed to appear here today.  I just add that to my statement.\n\"In order to assist the Committee I decided to make this affidavit and this affidavit is only to be used for purposes of the Commission's work and I understand that it cannot be used against me in any legal action.\nDuring October 1985 I was a lieutenant in the South African Railway Police and stationed at Bellville at the Regional Task Force.  \nOn the 15th of October 1985 there was a lot of unrest in the Athlone area and the focal points of the unrest were in Thornton Roads and Belgravia Road.  Vehicles were stoned and burning objects were used to blockade roads and a lot of damage was done to private property, especially vehicles.  At that stage the unrest had been continuing for some days and experience had taught us that there was not much use in trying to apprehend the ringleaders, or to try and arrest them by means of normal policing methods and normal police vehicles, because as soon as a police vehicle appeared on the scene the people would just disappear.\nOn the afternoon of the 15th of October 1985 I was summoned to the caravan which served as the Joint Operational Centre for the security forces that was stationed at Manenberg Police Station.  \nMr Loedolff, the commanding officer of the Regional Task Group instructed me to go in the direction of Athlone with an unmarked vehicle.  We were supposed to move in the direction of Athlone Police Station in Belgravia Road and then to Thornton Road, back to Old Lansdowne Road, back to Lansdowne Road, around Old Crossroads and Manenberg Police Station.\nHe pointed out a truck to me.  In the back of this truck there were wooden crates and told me that my section members had to conceal themselves in these crates.   His instructions were further that should we be attacked or stopped at road blockades we should try to arrest those responsible. \nMr Loedolff also mentioned to me that if it were to become necessary to open fire we should exercise caution so that the people on the left-hand side of the truck should fire in the left-hand direction and the same for the people on the right-hand side of the truck to prevent those people, members on the truck, actually firing at each other and thereby exposing their colleagues to danger.\nThe persons under my command were, on instructions of Loedolff, given 9mm pistols and shotguns.  The shotguns were loaded with birdshot or AAA shot.  The bigger type of shot, namely SSG and LG were not used on that particular day.  I inspected the section members to make sure that they had their shotguns and that they were not loaded with any other type of ammunition other than AAA and no.1.\nThe following members were under my command on that day; Sgt A M Smith, of the Railway Police, he was the driver of the truck. Sgt Sayer from the South African Railway Police.  He was the passenger in the front.  He was also the notary of the section.  W/O Swart from the South African Railway Police.  Constable A J Smit from the South African Railway Police.  Constable A J Rossel from the South African Railway Police, and Sgt J J Burger, South African Railway Police. Constable W K F Puchert of the South African Police.  Constable P H du Toit, South African Police\".\nYou will note - once again I deviate from my statement made to the Commission on Monday to say that we also decided that Constable, I am not sure, maybe he was Sergeant Frank van Niekerk, would also join us on the truck.  \n\"Apart from the driver and the passenger the other people in the crates, they hid in the crates on the back of the truck except for Sergeant Burger who sat in a little compartment behind the driver.  I was also in the back of the truck on the driver's side.\nAt about 16h45 we entered the unrest area of Athlone in this truck.  On the corner of Thornton and St Simons Roads in Athlone the vehicle was attacked by a group of people who stoned the vehicle using stones, half bricks and other objects.  \nFrom where I was concealed in the back of the truck I heard the windscreen breaking and how the driver brought the vehicle to a halt.  I immediately stood up and noticed that they were burning blockades in front of the truck, to the right.  The vehicle was stationary and I notice that on my side of the truck, that is the right side of the truck, there was between a 100 and 200 people, who according to my observation, were busy hurling objects at the truck.\nFrom experience I knew that the normal modus operandi when a group attacked such a truck, was to first try and bring to a halt this vehicle, to then stone it, to then move closer and slash the tyres to prevent it from carrying on.  Thereafter it would be set alight.  I also realised that we were in danger and especially the people in the front of the truck were already in danger of their lives.  There was no doubt in my mind that if we didn't immediately react to this attack we would probably not emerge from this attack alive.\nI then took my shotgun loaded with AAA and fired in the direction of the attackers on my side, that is the right side of the vehicle.  Because I told the section members before our departure that should we find ourselves in danger that they should not shoot until I had given the order, my section members, after I fired the first shot, also started firing at the attackers.\nAfter we commenced firing the attackers ceased their attack and I gave instructions to my members to stop firing.\nMembers then jumped from the truck on my instruction and tried to arrest some of the attackers.  Quite a few arrests were in fact made.  I did not take part in the arrests because I was protecting the truck.\nAlthough I can't remember exactly how many shots I fired I noticed that I said in my statements after the incident that I had fired seven shots and I accept that as correct.  All the shots fired by myself were aimed at the attackers who were attacking us with stones and other objects.  \nI also remember that I fired at a person wearing a green shirt who was busy throwing stones at us, although I can't say whether I actually hit the person, a person with a green shirt who I think was the same person was later found dead in a house nearby.  I last saw the person running in the direction of that house.  I later ascertained that the person was Shaun Magmoed.\nOn the left-hand side of the truck two people were fatally wounded, Michael Miranda and Jonathan Claasen.  Because my attention was focused on the attack coming from the right-hand side of the truck I can't give any further details regarding the fatal wounding of these two last-mentioned people, although I accept and assume that they died as a result of shooting wounds sustained in the incident.  One of them was a young boy.  He was approximately 10 years old.\nI have no doubt that the attack on us was unlawful and that if I and my members did not react to these attackers we would have been killed or very seriously injured, especially if the attackers succeeded in setting the vehicle alight causing us to escape in amongst the attackers.\nI must point out that the conduct of a crowd, who have already commenced with acts of violence, that is unpredictable and that many people had been killed by crowds in unrest situations in the country.  Although I expected stones to be thrown at the vehicle and that our actions were specifically aimed at arresting some of these culprits I never foresaw the possibility of an attack of such intensity and launched by so many people. I was caught unawares by surprise.  The intensity of the attack was of such a nature that the only response in the circumstances was to start shooting at the attackers.\nAfter the incident I made two affidavits, the first dated the 19th of October 1985 and a supplementary affidavit dated the 12th of February 1987.  I also testified on the 17th of July 1986 in the prosecution of E Surja and 12 others who were charged in the Regional Court on charges of public violence arising from the incidents of this particular day. \nAfterwards on the 4th of February 1988 I testified during a formal inquest into the death of the persons who died during this incident.  \nI was told, and I believe that it is correct that the Commission is in possession of both the statements which I made, as well as the transcription of the testimony that I gave at the two occasions.  \nI am also aware of the fact that a video recording was made of the incident and that that is similarly in the possession of the Commission.\nI do not have any other documentation or evidentiary material which could help the Commission in regard to this particular incident.\nThe incident obviously had a tremendous effect on my life.  It, amongst other things, led to me losing 22 kgs of weight.  I went down from 83 kgs to 61 kgs and brought about a lot of tension in my marriage.  This brought about a divorce in 1990, but I had already left my wife and child for some considerable time before the final divorce date.\nApart from this I was also charged, along with my section members and others, in a private prosecution in the Supreme Court in Cape Town on charges of murder arising from this incident.  After a protracted trial of about five months we were found not guilty.  An appeal was noted to the Appellate Division in Bloemfontein but the appeal was also unsuccessful.  The court case, which took place about five years after the incident, led to further severe tension between myself and the people around me, and that is in fact putting it mildly.\nIn the middle of 1990, I was, on my own request, transferred to the South African Defence Force where I did internal investigations.  Since 1994 I have been working in the private sector as a security advisor.  \nToday, 12 years after this incident and after being thoroughly cross-examined about what happened on that day on two occasions, and being put through a long trial and having listened to my conduct being criticised I am still convinced that if I had not shot at the attackers on that afternoon my members and myself would probably have died on that day, or would have been seriously injured.\nThe fact that people and especially a young child lost their lives in this incident is something which will stay with me till the day of my death.  I am sorry that such a thing had to happen.  \nToday I realise that if the government of the day had started on the road of negotiations at a much earlier stage incidents such as these would never have taken place.\nSigned:  Douw Vermeulen\".",

I think that - we do appreciate the difficulty, but we've had many witnesses come here to the Commission even witnesses who came to testify about the incident who struggled with the memory of the events themselves and many of them cried through their testimony and that is expected.  When people re-tell an experience that was traumatic it is part of it and we are hoping that as part of the catharsis, as part of the way of dealing with the trauma, it is one way to deal with the trauma from the depths of themselves.  So it is important, and we perceive this process as important.  It is more important to speak truthfully about the incident because that is one way in which any person suffering from trauma can release himself or herself from the pressure of the trauma.  And for that reason I may have to get back to the video.  I will not be able to promise that I will not go back to the video.  This is part of the evidence, part of the testimony and the trauma, re-traumatising of people is unfortunate, but fortunately one consequence of it is that when people speak the truth they are released from the burden of the trauma, somehow.\nI will just ask one last time, or rather mention that the video is not edited.  We do not have editing facilities.  We got the video from CBS, a copy of the original video and it is not edited.  So I am referring to the video as unedited.

Now it's quite some time since I've left the Police and my legal knowledge isn't up to scratch, but if I recall the section correctly it is a section dealing with what the Police can or may do when there is no other alternative to arresting a person.  The Section provides that you may shoot at a person if he commits a certain scheduled offence.  It then becomes necessary to arrest this person.  You may shoot him in certain circumstances and that that shooting then could be done with impunity.\nBecause I am personally very opposed to this type of arrest I had never and never will arrest a person where I have to first shoot him dead.

I mean it was a culture of enemy of us and them, enemy being anybody who is Black is the enemy. I mean in most cases, especially when people are involved in such a situation they are perceived as the enemy.  It's the kind of perception that was drilled in the minds of South Africans.

If you want to include those other two people then I must qualify that paragraph and say that I can't testify about Miranda and Claasen, I did not see them throwing stones and if the word \"persons\" is then the wrong word in the context of that paragraph then I would like to qualify that.  I can only say what I saw happening on the right side of the vehicle.",

Are we to accept that the entire document, you stand by it, and that is what we have to accept in this thing?  Because you see the wounds that the person that died, Shaun Magmoed had, are wounds that are on his back, suggesting to anyone who was in the audience that the person must have been running away.  And it is consistent with this paragraph.  You are saying here that he was running away and the wounds are on his back.\nDo you agree that the person, the question is, do you agree that the person who was shot at was running away?",

May I refer you to paragraph 2 and would you please allow me to then ask a question.  If this statement of mine was so flawless that we could just accept it in total, why would I have admitted that a ninth person should be added to the list?\nWhy would I then have said that Frank van Niekerk's name should be inserted because he was also present on the truck?   I noticed that there was a mistake, I noticed Frank van Niekerk's name was missing and I think that if I was able to add Frank van Niekerk's name then I also have the right to say Madam Chair what I meant in paragraph 5 or 6 was this or that.
