Okay I think as I said yesterday we're gonna, I think we're gonna approach today by splitting into two groups with the, and we're gonna phrase the topics so that they orientate themselves around recommendations because that's our end point. I don't think some of the sections actually lend themselves. Like the role of psychologist regarding political prisoners. I don't think that's the sort of recommendation type sort of topic that will help us. So I'll speak to those when we move onto the groups. Can I invite Glenda to do a review of yesterday and then Wendy will follow to really sort contextualise that work within the Truth Commission's mandate so we become clear about what our task is.

            "I was thinking you know, how valuable will a review be because most of the people who are here in fact did the presentations. But perhaps just to remind ourselves of what areas have been covered and what were the important points made by some of the presenters. I've tried to, where presenters have, have mentioned the same issues sort of incorporated them altogether. So if I don't mention your name, I'll mention the issues.\n The presentations started, the morning started off with Dr. Saths Cooper reminding us a little bit about the status of mental health and the status of health delivery in South Africa and presented a few facts in that regard. Particularly with relation to the somatic bias in treatment and health care delivery in South Africa but also pointing to the lack of mental health delivery and the innovative mental health delivery systems within South Africa.\n With regards to mental health legislation he reminded us that we need to give consideration to issues of kinship relationships and family context and develop that, incorporate that into legislation. Also in formulating policy we need to examine other societies where innovative legislation has been developed with regard to marginalised people and he mentioned India with the programme for the Untouchables, so called Untouchables. Where there's a window period of time for preferential employment and other opportunities for those people who have been historically marginalised and excluded from such opportunities. \n We were also reminded of the bases, particularly the philosophical bases of legislation and to remember that previous legislation, particularly mental health legislation was based on Apartheid ideology. And thus the present legislative attempts and the ways in which we develop legislation should bear that in mind. We should also look to not just making technical amendments to the Mental Health Act for example but, also look to developing legislation which will focus on wellness and well-being. Rather than just including a few, I suppose politically correct terminology to make the act look good.\n Then the question of the ownership of knowledge arose and we, I think we all agree that our academia and other discourse around mental health is based on the Euro-American paradigm and that we should actually make that paradigm shift. And develop our own indigenous knowledge and our own indigenous body of discourse. \n We were also challenged as a commission to look at a few issues. One being that we should look to the recommendation of the rationalisation of departments and ministries that deal with human resources and human resource delivery. And attempt to bring together under one umbrella as it were, departments that deal with human resources and human resource delivery.\n We also were challenged to interact with other commissions and other institutions that deal with human rights issues and human resource development.\n With regard to human resource development there were some interesting suggestions with regard to curriculum change and new ways of producing at the end practitioners who are able to immediately go into the field and to deliver. And the example given was the - what was it (...indistinct)? The B.Psych degree where people would come out as counsellors and are able to immediately practise as practitioners.\n Lionel Nicholas presented some interesting critique on some of the work of the commission. Particularly his concern, I will raise here again is the issue of the abuse of psychological diagnosis in the attempt for people to gain amnesty. And I think that we need to really pay quite serious attention to that problem and deal with how we can highlight, how that kind of abuse needs to be dealt with.\n Professor Seedat reminded us of how we've been able to rationalise our on-going war in this country, our on-going conflict. And how as psychologists we've been able to in a sense sanitise the exploitation of blacks in labour and sanitise the issues of war in our country. He alluded to the issue of structural violence and it's relationship to interpersonal violence and also the whole notion of pathology and the issues of PTSD and how that impacts on our understanding of violence. \n But what was also very important in the presentation, certainly in my mind was the development of knowledge from non-academic people and how one can incorporate that into the mainstream academic knowledge. Confidence boosting amongst people who are not traditionally people who write academic works and so on. And how one can engage other people in writing. And the challenge really to the TRC at that point was; how can one facilitate that exercise? And particularly since we've been forging partnerships with people in NGO's, training people to be involved in our briefing process and so on. And how can we incorporate all of that knowledge?\n I think the implications for the future in terms of Professor Seedat's presentation was how do we adapt to the new dispensation taking into account that we've come through a very violent and conflictual past and how do we deal with the issues of democracy but also deal with the issues of conflict in the past and the legacy that we, that is left behind. \n I think the biggest challenge that came to us from the Citizen's Commission for Human Rights was the issue of the worse thing that can be done is not to do anything. And I think that the challenge there is how do we take up what has come before us in those presentations, incorporate that into our report and make very solid recommendations for good delivery and good mental health interventions in the future.\n In the afternoon's presentations, particularly by Professor Mike Simpson looked very carefully again at the issue of post traumatic stress disorder, the long term impact of post traumatic stress disorder and trauma. And also the intergenerational and multi-generational factors involved in dealing with trauma. But also looked at how we need to consider the issues of commodity and perhaps personality in the, when people present PTSD as a mitigating factor in their applications. \n I think the presentations with regard to psychiatric care and psychiatric nursing and interventions, mental health interventions needs to be looked at critically with a view to how we can make solid recommendations about good interventions in the future. I think most of us who have been involved in working in psychiatric hospitals and elsewhere are well aware of the conditions that mental patients, psychiatric patients are subjected to. But also not just to rehash and dwell on the narrative and explaining what has happened but also to look towards how we can make recommendations about solid and good psychiatric interventions.\n  Our mandate is very limited and yesterday we were getting a bit concerned about the challenges that were being placed before us as a commission. So Wendy will be talking a little bit about what our statutory mandate is. But also I think that we have accepted the challenge that we can act as a catalyst and forge together relationships with organisations and NGO's and academics and other people to continue this process into the future. Thank you.\nDR. ORR: Thanks Glenda. You actually took one of the words right out of my mouth, I have catalyst written down here in front of me as well. It's my task to perhaps inject a dose of realism into the proceedings and I want to do this in a way which doesn't dampen people's enthusiasm and desire to bring about change. But which perhaps underlines what the capacity and the statutory mandate of the Truth Commission is. In other words what the Truth Commission can and cannot do. It doesn't mean to say that other things can't be done through forging alliances and using or creating new organisations. And as I say catalyst is one of the words I've used. A facilitator for change is certainly a role that the Truth Commission can play. But I think it's very important that the health sector and I use this in the broader sense of the word, from mental health to doctors, nurses, OT's, physiotherapists, needs to put it's own house in order. And not look to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to solve the problems which exist within the health sector.\n The mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is very clear. And that is to establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of the gross violations of human rights committed during the period of 1 March 1960 to 10 May 1994, including antecedent circumstances, factors and context, etc, etc, etc. And the definition of a gross violation of human rights is killing, abduction, torture or severe ill-treatment of any person which emanated from the conflicts of the past and committed by a person acting with a political motive. \n Now that's really quite a limited mandate. We've tussled with the definition of \"severe ill-treatment\" and have come up with one which we hope is more or less acceptable. But it does exclude for instance the kinds of things and being a doctor I'm going to use medical examples. It would excluded for instance doctors having separate waiting rooms for white and black patients. And while I believe that, that is a violation, certainly of professional ethics, it would not fall within the definition of a gross violation of human rights in terms of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. So we need to bear in mind that our mandate is really to deal with quite a limited group of violations. \n However the open door for us is that we are also mandated to compile a report containing recommendations of measures to prevent future violations of human rights. And interestingly enough they don't say gross violations of human rights in this particular section. So that does widen things up for us. \n And also to make recommendations to the president with regard to the creation of institutions conducive to a stable and fair society and measures which should be introduced to prevent the commission of violations of human rights. So that's really the door which I think this workshop must be focusing on. The issue of recommendations which can be introduced and institutions which can be created in order to reassure non-repetition of violations of human rights. And I think as we look at those, formulating those recommendations we need to be careful not to throw and I think someone else said this yesterday as well - not to throw the baby out with the bath water. We have professional organisations, we have statutory bodies. Yes they have histories, they come with a lot of baggage but that doesn't mean that they are completely incapable of transformation. I think the fact that an organisation like SISA has grown out of what has existed in the past and is doing some incredibly exciting and proactive work is an example of what can be created from what was. And I think we must interact with existing statutory and professional organisations to try and bring about change within those and to really be very active in pushing for change and transformation. \n An example; I know a great deal of negative things have been said about the South African Medical and Dental Council and I agree that their history is not one to be proud of. But as a direct result of the hearings which were held in June, they have asked for a change in the act which governs their work in order to enable them to be proactive in their investigations. Because that was one of our biggest criticisms of them. That they could only respond when a complaint was made. They have now asked for a change in the act so that they can investigate when they believe that unethical behaviour or unethical conduct is occurring. And that's a very positive change and a very exciting thing and it's a concrete step which the Medical and Dental Council has taken as a result of the catalytic, facilitating role which the Truth Commission has played. \n And I think that's what we'd like to focus on in our workshopping today. Is how we can use existing organisations? What kind of transformation needs to take place in them? Do we need new bodies? Do we need a human rights, a health and human rights watch dog body which ensures accountability and puts in checks and balances and those sorts of things? The kind of physicians for human rights in South Africa. But we want to be very concrete in our recommendations and very realistic. \n I think I must also remind you of the capacity of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it is limited. We were asked for instance to subpoena documents to investigate life care institutions and Smith Mitchell and while I agree that this is necessary, the TRC cannot do it. And I'm going to be perfectly frank with you. We had about 17 000 statements from victims which have to be corroborated by investigative unit, we have seven and a half thousand amnesty applications which have to be investigated and either ratified or proved incorrect by investigative unit. We have a number of special investigations which are going on for instance into cross-border raids, into taxi violence, into train violence. So our investigative unit does not have the capacity to do that kind of work within the health sector and it's up to us to try and work out how that could be done by another body, be it an existing one or a new one. So as I say a very strong reality check that I'm giving you here. \n Also in terms of amnesty I want to remind you that the cut-off date for amnesty has passed. So we cannot call for people to apply for amnesty now. The cut-off date was the 30th of September this year. So if people have not applied for amnesty it's too late and we need to explore other ways of finding out what for instance psychiatrists or doctors or nurses or whatever did during the period under review. Amnesty is no longer an option.\n As I say I hope this hasn't thrown a whole lot of cold water on your enthusiasm. I think there is still tremendous scope in our final report for making really creative, concrete, viable recommendations to ensure that the human rights violations which we spoke about yesterday are not repeated in the future and I look forward to our deliberations this morning, coming up with those kinds of recommendations.

Just to say that when we, what we're aiming towards is the kind of recommendations that's not broad and general because I think anyone in the commission could have made a load of recommendations before this workshop that are sort of broad, wide ranging. You know \"We think they should be A, B, C, D.\" And really nothing would come of them. I think we have to really be quite specific and focus in very, very clearly and try and be, well as specific as possible.

            "I mean this morning there was a concern about a split. Can we just ask people to report on behalf of their groups? Before they do that, let's be in agreement as to how we are going to take the process forward. We will let, are we going to allow a person to go through everything and then start checking each and every point? Okay it's like most people are happy with that. So can we get a reporter of group 1 and 2?\nDR. ORR: I by default and to my surprise and (...indistinct) for  group 1. We spent some time with the (...indistinct) looking at the old mental health act and then were very helpfully advised by the representative from the Gauteng Mental Health Services, what's his name I can't remember I'm afraid. That the new Mental Health Act in fact doesn't even deserve that name yet. It's still very much in the process of being thought about. A draft hasn't even been produced which is actually good news for us because there's still a lot of time for us to make input and suggestions as to what the new Mental Health Act should look like.\n We found it difficult to come to consensus on this issue. The two kind of diverse opinions which were represented was 1: that without a doubt we do need a new Mental Health Act which should be separate. Which should be, which should take mental health out of the purview and dominance of the medical profession. On the other hand we had a point of view that said the Mental Health and the Health Act should be combined. So that we have one comprehensive act which puts everyone on the same footing and which covers health (...indistinct) in terms of both of those recommendations. I think we did reach consensus on the fact that the old Mental Health Act certainly needs a great deal of revision. But whether it becomes part of an overall health act or not we were unable to decide.\n We then discussed the issue which was also raised yesterday of instead of having a Department of Health and a Department of Welfare having a Department of Human Services. And again we discussed whether this should be a separate new department or whether it should be a, whether we should set up a multi-disciplinary committee with representatives from all the ministries involved, which meets once or twice a year to discuss the issue of human services. To ensure that people are viewed as whole beings rather than as bits and pieces and that we look at the issue of well-being in the overall, holistic sense. So that was another suggestion that we really explore quite thoroughly the issue of a department or a committee on human services.\n We were also reminded that traditional healers should not be left out of this equation and we must bear in mind that they are on the ground and available already. And they need to be brought into whatever service provision is planned for the future.\n We then looked at education and training and I think the consensus was that without a doubt doctors dominate the health care sector because they are taught to dominate the health care sector. Because in their training they only interact with other health care professions in an hierarchical, autocratic kind of way and we would encourage the creation of multi-disciplinary training where there are issues which are cross-disciplinary. Students are brought together from nursing, OT's, physiotherapy, wherever to undergo training together, to interact with each other. To talk to each other and to realise in fact that medicine is not necessarily a hierarchy. That we all have particular skills and knowledge and those should be used appropriately in multi-disciplinary teams where the doctor is not necessarily the head of the team.\n It was pointed out that perhaps one of the reasons why the medical profession has dominated for so long is that it has received most of government funding, both in terms of training and service provision and that issue needs to be looked at. Whether it's appropriate in fact for us to, for the government to be putting so much money into the training of doctors and the provision of what has been really Euro-Western type biological model of medical care. Because looking back over the last forty years we must agree that medical dominance has not resulted in good health care for the vast majority of the South African population. So training and research funding need to be re-examined. \n Rural areas need a particular focus in whatever services are provided and also in the training of health professionals. They need to be made aware of what the particular needs are in rural areas and how to consult with communities in those areas as to what the needs are.  Wherever health services are offered so should mental health services be offered. Mental health is a primary health care concern and should come out of the kind of mental institution and into the primary health care clinic. \n The last issue we looked at was that of custodial care which includes the issues of dual responsibility. Does the doctor, nurse, psychologist's primary responsibility to his or her employer or to his or her patient? And we all agreed entirely that the primary responsibility is to the patient or client. And that confidentiality is paramount and that this should be protected by law.\n We also proposed the setting up of some sort of independent - I hate this word - whistle blower network. But some (",

            ") (...indistinct) system in which independent reportage of abuses and unethical behaviour can take place in a confidential way. So that the person who is reporting is not subsequently intimidated or discriminated against but the issues are brought to the attention of a body which can take action around the unethical behaviour. So we're talking about some kind of watch dog body, ombudsperson, you know you can name it what you like. But we feel it's very important that this kind of system be put in place. And we believe that we should be encouraging the professional organisations to be playing a proactive role in setting up these kinds of networks. And we feel that they have neglected this role in the past and should be taking this up as part of showing their commitment to transformation.\n We believe it's important that custodial institutions be open to public scrutiny and reportage and that section 66 A of the Mental Health Act should be scrapped. The new act is non-existent at the moment.\n We briefly discussed medication and with the implementation of the Essential Drug List we hope that every institution will have access to those drugs which are on the EDL. And I can't believe that, that won't be the case but it's certainly an absolute recommendation that, that is the case. That every institution no matter what it is or where it is or what it does should have access to the same drugs and that very clear guidelines should be drawn up about the appropriate usage of drugs. The input was that particularly in mental health care  drugs are often used as punishment or for the convenience of the service provider rather than for the well-being and for the health of a patient. And that is a situation which needs change.\n I don't know if there are other members of my group who feel that I've missed something out who want to add things.",

            "Okay thanks. I would have deferred to my group as well but as it stands at the moment I feel that what we spoke about. We spent, we initially started discussing training which came under the role of mental health workers in transforming society. I then spoke quite beautifully about SISA's initiative to, based on the fact that there's currently a drastic fallout from induction for graduates, from induction to graduation. And that people are actually falling out of courses and from about 500 inducted students you end up with about 8 qualified psychologists. SISA's proposal and it might not be that new in terms of the national proposals but is to suggest a diploma which qualifies someone in specific areas. In other words you get an Aids Counsellor or a - I don't know, a Bereavement Counsellor, a Trauma Counsellor. And really the proposal that came from that was that we should endorse that broadening and demystifying of mental health services which make it more accountable and also more accessible to the people who need it. And that's because I mean it's cost effective, it's got a better service delivery and then also to include the experiences that we've learned from the consequences from gross human rights violations into primary health care teaching and the curricula itself. So that was our first training recommendation.\n Then we spoke at length about this issue of knowledge acquisition and ownership. And the group spoke for quite a long time around the issue of incorporating the TRC's body of knowledge into a culture of story telling and keeping a self examination and revisiting memories. The sharing of collecting material, how could we promote that? How could the Truth Commission make a recommendation that promotes that short of culture of looking back and examining the material that's come up from the Truth Commission. There was a recommendation to stress the importance of developing a case study and role playing aspect of teaching not just, moving away from a lecture paradigm. Also to incorporate the TRC's body of knowledge into the history curriculum. I mean the discussion was around really not losing all the rich information that the Truth Commission has gathered; all the tapes, all the testimonies, all the different stories from different role players.\n Okay the other issue around the knowledge question was promoting our current body of history as a national treasure and really with the group for the Truth Commission should put some thought towards how that would be done. Or how we would do that. There was a suggestion of living monuments but not one national monument but monuments that are linked locally. That people can go to and link into other monuments in other regions and discover. So basically the story telling doesn't stop with the Commission. That it carries on and that people as part of well-being or mental health actually have on-going access to that kind of information.\n There was a recommendation that stories of torture continue to be recorded and that research continues, needs to happen, is to continue following the Truth Commission's work. Specifically on torture and it's consequences. And that government and private funders should prioritise this area of research in terms of not only examining torture but survival issues of resilience, long term effects of torture, impacts on communities of torture. So there should be a strong recommendation to prioritise that as a research need. Then which also feeds into the fact that on top of that what we thought research, it's another question how accessible that research and accessible the results of that research would be. \n In terms of policy - what's the issue on the board? Okay, contribution to policy development. The recommendation was that the Truth Commission should examine ways of presenting new knowledge so the communities can benefit. And move away from the external research paradigm. We discussed that at length. We didn't come up with particularly specific recommendations around that but generally I think if we can phrase it at a later date how research for whom and by whom.  In a nutshell we wanted to also in terms of policy the buzz word was we need to democratise the lobbying process.  Governments and state services should be able to prove public participation in policy development. There was a suggestion to set up toll free numbers, this would increase accountability of government policy making and the accessibility that people have to it. It was quite an interesting idea to set up a toll free because often government departments say: \"We've asked the community to make comment on this.\" But people actually can't, they don't have the way withal to feedback. So if those departments set up toll free numbers people could ring in. And postal, free postal.\n We also hit on whistle blowing protection. I think Wendy's almost shows exactly what we said. Also the role of the public protector doesn't seem to, I think that needs to be reinforced. Because that is a kind of whistle blowing, how can I say, vessel that people have available to them. But I don't think people are aware of that. So a recommendation is that it should somehow reinforce the role of public protector.\n And then finally we spoke about endorsing on-going research into the corrupt and racist psychological research that have happened and exposure of the negative effects of this and where the funding came from. And to prevent the disappearance of research documents that seems to be on-going. In terms of the Truth Commission I think it was recommendation that we simply endorse the on-going investigations into these things. \n And then contribution to progressive psychology we had, our recommendation concerning that was government and academic institutions must support community mental health initiatives at community level by providing funding, resources and including inputs into policy development. So I think that was the issue around the CBO's and the NGO's and their relationship to government and that really if the Truth Commission can sort of nudge those government to keep supporting those. Because in a lot of these areas that we've been discussing it seems that in terms of community we haven't discussed communities very much. Those organisations that are maintaining a community focus with regard to well-being or mental health. So we can only, I don't know how to pitch that recommendation. But that's what we, basically that's what we spoke to. \n And in terms of what's the issue?  Enhancing representivity, we thought that representivity was such a broad concept that we couldn't really pin it down, so we didn't even try to. Although acknowledging what the different, what it was actually trying to aim at, which was I think through the training recommendations. It's about really getting the whole spate of South Africans into, this word \"well-being\" is coming into the conversation too much. But inter-mental health issues and how we do that. But I  don't think it's unique to the TRC's mandate, representivity and that kind of affirmative angle. That's what we discussed.",

And that in many relevant areas including the whole of the mental health and human rights field, documentation that is very relevant has already been shredded, is today being shredded and will tomorrow be shredded. And we're suggesting that it should be looked at seriously by your investigations division, whether in areas where there have been complaints about institutions or specific parties. Whether you shouldn't use your powers to seize documentation and have copies of it at least placed in archives so that they will be accessible for other investigators who will come on after the TRC. Because if not, the likelihood is that any other mechanisms you set up to succeed yourselves (a): won't have the power to get access to that sort of documentation or (b): when they get there the cupboard will be bare and the shelves will be empty.

So because we should always go back, I know we will take this thing back to our context at the end of the day. And they have looked at, the proposal that they looked at, there was this suggestion of a Department of Human Service which will get rid of Welfare and have a multi-professional health and guidance centres. That was the amended proposal.\n And issues which fall under classical psychiatry will remain in the Department of Health with psychiatric hospitals, if they're still in existence and hospital care remaining under the Department of Health. But most conflicts in living will need to be looked at under a human service department. That's one part of the proposal. And that will impact on a Mental Health Act, the future one.",

So that do not need to go to, you know to be viewed as people who really are mad. These people have got the psychological problems that have not been resolved. So the approach of the service will be more centred towards the psychological problem than being deep=seated psychiatric syndrome. I think that was part of the rationale. My concern with that proposal was that if we are looking at creating that service how long will it take and how long more can these people wait and what are the time frames that we can at least implement this?

ORR: I'm going to try and summarise from what Victor Nel said and I'm not sure myself yet if I agree with everything he said. It's a new concept for me and I would have to think through it. There are a number of motivations for creating a Department of Human Services. I think one of the issues which Professor Nel was very concerned about is that the Department of Health at the moment has control over all the professions and this control is exercised largely through the South African Medical and Dental Council. There is a separate professional board for nurses. But otherwise the SAMDC controls all health services. And he finds it very problematic that the scope of the profession of psychology is determined in effect by the medical profession. And that's not, not the way it should be.\n There are no public low cost psychology services in South Africa, particularly in rural areas and this is a huge gap in the provision of services. And even in tertiary hospitals psychologists are few and far between. It's very difficult to render appropriate mental health services in a medical setting and he quoted the U.S. model which I think has been referred to previously in the workshop, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which provides comprehensive care, which includes health care but also looks at issues of welfare, of socio-economic well-being, of housing. In other words all the kinds of services that one needs in order to live as a dignified human being. And I think that was the rationale behind it.

Or has provided in any way more articulate or more holistic sense of care to people or a better sense of well-being. There is an overall government department with that name but in fact whatever point of access people have still comes under separate divisions. There's still the interprofessional problems of who controls what. None of those problems have been solved where the model he's proposing has been attempted.

Because we can be - alright I'll restrict myself to psychology because I know it better than other areas. If we come here as psychologists and want to use this as a forum for clarifying the future for psychology it will be an abuse of the process. If we raise the past exclusions of psychology in terms of positive contribution that are likely to be made then it's one thing. And I can see that we can end up raising various territorial battles which will completely move away from the primary purpose of the commission. And I think we need to always link whatever we're coming up with in terms on broad sweeps to the particular what do we do to enable people who have been mutilated both physically and psychologically by gross and lesser human violations in the past? Where do we locate an institutional entablement for treatment or rehabilitation, or any other word that's more politically appropriate to use for those people, who have come to the commission. Primarily victims but also what do we do with the perpetrators in our midst? Just leave them there and allow them to perpetuate a culture of socialising those whom they influence?\n And it would seem to me that this institution should be an enabling institution with a limited life. Otherwise it can become an institution forever. With a limited life after the commission ends and it should traipse, it should rely on traipse both the ministries of health and welfare, as well as education and maybe trade and industry for economic entrepreneurship.

So that it's very important for victims not to feel that they're just victims. Because those victims have brought us to where we are and without those, in a very selfish way, if we didn't have those victims we're unlikely to have been here. And we need to affirm those victims.

And it's only been the big names and the people who have stood out and been forceful about their roles that have got the type of respect that I think the commission has given.\n But in the main my impression is a lot of victims out there have come through a process that has perpetuated a victim syndrome in them.

The statements we have, people who have come be forward, reporting on their experiences. So I mean, that really is very, very central to our concern.\n And regarding Victor Nel's proposal and what has been said, I should think through this discussion we have in a way brought the two views together.

And during that period ministries will have time to incorporate in their planning whatever have been initiated.

I don't think we believe there was anything particularly controversial in what we were suggesting but perhaps the rest of the group might like input. On point which I forgot to make and Paul you should have reminded me about was that of oaths and declarations and how relevant and appropriate they are. I mean it's all very well stand up and say take the Hippocratic Oath or the Declaration of Geneva but what does it mean for your day to day practise and does it make a difference to your ethical or moral conduct as a health professional? And I know CCHR has proposed one overriding loyalty oath which all health professionals will take. The British Medical Association is working on also one oath. It's kind of an update of the Declaration of Geneva. Which all health professionals will take.\n But I think in addition to that, simply taking an oath at the end of your period of training without working through and discussing the issues and practically problem solving around issues which those oaths raise it's absolutely pointless. I mean it makes those oaths not worth the paper that they're written on. And I think it's absolutely essential that those things be included in training. And that also part of the job of whatever it's going to be, the watch dog body, the ombudsperson, etc, would be to ensure that, that professionals do in fact maintain the promises which they made in those oaths.\n So that the other points that we raised was that we need to look again at the skewing of funding allocation which seems to go primarily towards traditional Euro-Western medical model training and research and it should perhaps be reallocated. Medical dominance has not resulted in good care and we should be looking rather at multi-disciplinary teams where we make the best use of everyone's skills, knowledge and expertise and where the doctor is not necessarily the head of the team. We raised the issue of access and I think this follows on Saths' point. Access for victims to, both to training and education and to services. And referred to the programme which is being introduced in India for the untouchables.\n Rural areas need a particular focus. Mental health care needs to be included as part of primary health care and traditional healers needs to be included as part of training and that in training there should be cross-disciplinary training. So that, that we try and break down the (...indistinct) as a hierarchy and flatten it out and have nurses train with doctors and physiotherapists train with pharmacists or whatever. But basically in the training attempt very, very to, to do away with the hierarchy which exists in the present health sector.",

ORR: I think we would want more than a module. I think we'd want human rights and ethical issues to be incorporated into everything that students are taught. I think having a separate module makes it very easy to split it off. And we've used the word split more than once today. And to put it in a box and not include it in the way in which you interact with and treat your patients and clients every day.

            "Well (...intervention) to Dr. Cooper?\nDR. COOPER: I think it's very important to have an oath. However we have these codes right now, okay. And I want to underline the report by Wendy. You need to actually have in a sense a mandated, in a mandated fashion ethical practise to become more central than it is in the health professions generally. That this is not good enough just to have as a curriculum point. You need to interact with the trainers because I think that's where our problem lies. You have all these people teaching at the medical schools and medical faculties and psychology schools and OT and wherever else you may need them, social work and so on. But how do they deal with ethics and with codes which actually ought to rise above narrow interests, narrow ideology and those types of things.\n Right now the Hippocratic oath says one should do those things but in the practise it's being violated. And it has been violated and there are notorious examples. And the Medical and Dental Council and MASA have been guilty of actually condoning and perpetuating that system. So how do we address it besides merely saying we need that oath? I think what we need to do is actually have and that enabling institution together with the Human Rights Commission, maybe need to visit the Geneva Code plus the other suggestions made by colleagues during the TRC hearing process. And emerge with a, an code of conduct or an oath that not only health professionals but members of the police, the military and whatever other services and forces are out there, who have been responsible for the gross violations in the first place. Ought to with a slight change be able to adapt for their particular institutions.\n So we shouldn't look at it as merely a health sector thing and narrow it down to that because in some ways the health sector was dragooned into playing these roles and they went willingly. Many of them didn't scream at all about it. So I would like to bring that side of it to play. I think it's important to add besides the untouchable situation in India, something that Lionel raised yesterday during lunch and that's the, like the GI Bill, the Veterans' Bill in the Us. It's affirmative towards those people who have paid a price for their country. Very different in terms of the GI's and the American Vets but in a sense they are veterans. They ought to be in our national hall of fame but we only will get the Mandelas and the Mbekis and the Sisulus. We need those names as well added to it. Right, so I would say that we need to use that authority as well. And there are a few other examples I would imagine in South America, not very good ones. But wherever we can do it and your research people should be able to do that. So it's not, doesn't only look at a, another developing Third World non-European grouping, it also includes them, who inform our ethos. \n The issue of the training we ought to comment about the intercultural nature of our society and that, that needs to be confronted right up front. It shouldn't be a thing where some lecturer at Wits or RAU just glibly stands up and say: \"Take note that we're living in a multi-cultural society.\" We ought to have something that actually takes people through those things and so that our citizens can understand each other better. And there too I would urge interaction with the Human Rights Commission, but maybe the Gender Commission and the Education Department about looking at the issue of race and inter-cultural or ethic language issues in our society.\n With regard to opportunities to training and preference in the trade and industry sector we should also add jobs. Preference for jobs within the public sector. If we do it as an example in the public sector then commerce and industry, the private sector will say: \"Well they've had so and so and so and so and they've done well by appointing those people, maybe we should look at some of those people.\" And I think we should not just look at they must be given opportunities in education but they should be given preference in state sector jobs that may become open.",

I think from something like thirty years experience in trying to change health sciences education we all agree it's necessary. We are now asking to do what we tried to do thirty years ago. It's difficult. One of the things we need is both a specific place. There has to be somewhere that it is mandated that these human rights issues are included because otherwise one of the general principles that works is; whatever everyone believes, other people (...indistinct) we teach throughout our curriculum actually gets taught nowhere in the curriculum. There has to a place otherwise very often everybody feels free to neglect it. \"I didn't include it in my teaching today, I'm sure next week's lecturer will include it somewhere.\" Everybody feels free to leave it out. But the next and most critical problem is how you include that in the day to day teaching, in the day to day clinical work that everyone is exposed to. And the problem there and what makes that most important is how to translate the lofty principles of the statements of philosophers into reality. It's one thing to have a Solly Benatar give a lecture about the importance of the principle of benevolence. I don't any of us support a principle of malevolence. Though some of our colleagues have acted as if that was their guiding light. But the problem in most instances is how with this person in this dilemma, how can I be most benevolent? How do you apply those principles in particular examples? That a lecturer will not do very effectively in their lectures. That's where both the examples, some of the examples from the victims and some of the perpetrators that are being brought to the commission's notice, can be used in teaching. Because the question is; how did those situations happen and how could they be prevented? And that should be part of the problem the TRC won't finish solving but part of that duty must be passed on. Not only to the teachers, and they need retraining because you can't expect the teachers who spent thirty five years not teaching about this ethical dilemma to suddenly start doing so. Unless something changes in their way of doing it, in their motivation to doing it. And let that problem also pass onto our students to face the challenge of how to find solutions to that.",

What we looked at was the issues, several issues, one was accountability of the legislative process, be it provincial or national, not only that there has to be and I'll mention it in a minute, ways in which it's made easy access for communities and individuals to lobby and to try and influence planned legislation but also a responsibility on the governmental authorities formulating such policies to be able to prove that they did in fact make themselves accessible and that they did seek out access, not just from a handful of people who professionally represent all of us all the time but they've never actually asked us what we think, but to be genuinely accessible.  We talked about the value surprisingly neglected by government of having toll-free numbers and free-post addresses so that the average person even in a squatter camp who can get access to any public phone or to any public post box and a pen and paper will be able to have access and of course conversely the requirement of Government to make the drafts, the proposals out.  What has also often happened is that too complex a question has been thrown out the community, three people respond and they say we have consulted.  You don't put just a very, either in jargon or political correct terms, a complex programme problem out in four or five words and ask for a response but you say this is how we see the problem at present, these are the sort of things we are looking at and then there's something concrete that all communities can attach to and can say that wouldn't work here because of this, we would need something else because of that.  So it was that issue or both the responsibility that the authorities should prove that they had made meaningful efforts and the use of trivially simply methods like free access to allow ordinary people the access to those mechanisms and to have hearings accessible throughout the country, to have a hearing in Cape Town where people from the north have to spend an annual salary from the average small places to get down to the hearing is not public consultation and similarly to have one in Johannesburg and rely on the people in Cape Town to do the same is not open access.  So there must be other more creative ways made to make it easy for people who are concerned and we hope more and more of our communities will feel free to be concerned and involved, it's not simply a question of using the terms and saying thy were consulted.

I work with them, Lesley, Dr Lesley Gordon and London, why do I say Gordon, I don't know, I think London writes newspapers, writes books, novels, very funny novels.  Anyway I wanted to, I was feeling sad, I was wondering where are those doctors from the oppressed side who have really worked and seen this, not to say the others haven't, where are they, why are thy not here?  And I had actually kept that legal copy in the Star that Dr Dazoo of SASO had commented that the Truth Commission has been disappointing, the hearings don't help, they have been disappointing because he named names like Denise Amzee, like Variava Jura, Variava; these are people that are sort of heros in the struggle that we know, we felt that everything was around Dr Wendy Orr, not that we are very angry, we are jealous children in a family, that this child is the only one that has been given attention.  You know jealousy and conflict in a situation, in a family situation, siblings.  No it's not that to Wendy Orr personally but we felt that's how things are moving and the whole big South Africa was reduced.   I know the TRC couldn't be constrained itself so thin, otherwise then maybe it wouldn't do it's work but we felt the representation of the people who were invited there and who put in submissions was meeting and another thing is that even yesterday if I had not called Dr Simpson and told him what's happening, I think I would have been the only psychiatrist here.

I think that particularly at this phase you have the problem of the lack of time and resources but for whatever structures grow out of this, talking of the health and human rights watchdog and what have you, it is absolutely imperative that even if the work done in Cape Town is brilliant and comes up with the best plans conceivably produced by man and woman, unless those plans feel owned by the entire community of people who were active in this field, it will have serious handicaps.\n I think I'd like to also address a challenge that is often I hear put to the whole Truth Commission and particularly to this Committee and I think very unfairly.  I've heard a lot of people, particularly those from the perpetrator and more than ever the bystander community and we must never neglect and I hope you will all remember in your report the vital, essential, life-giving, evil role of the bystander throughout it and they say why are they just digging it all up, why don't we just put it behind us?  Well of course you can't put it behind you until it has at least for some time been in front of you, you can't get past it until you have seen where it is and what it is that needs to go past.  I think it's important to understand that we're not indulging in mere morbid story-telling when you do, when we do and when we urge from all people to listen to the stories of the victims.   It's not merely concentrating on terrible things that happened.  One of the things that we are concentrating on doing in this process is gaining the material with which to celebrate the small victories and the transcendence of evil by ordinary people, on the strength of ordinary people and their capacity to do that and that is one of our great national strengths that we need to recognise and value.  And we need to understand more of what is happening to the perpetrators because these were not monsters that were slobbering at the mouth like some creations of a Hollywood script writer.  The tragedy of South Africa's horrors, as it was of the holocaust and other such periods, was not that there are some special monsters who occasionally do terrible things, but that in certain situations, in certain circumstances, ordinary people; and listening to some of the perpetrators, extraordinarily ordinary people are capable of doing very terrible things and it is only by a proper examination of that that we can have any real chance of hoping that we will prevent this happening before.  If we don't know how it happened we won't be able to prevent it happening.  The more we try and understand it we may not be able to prevent it, but we'll never have a realistic chance of trying that.\n I think Saths raised another very important point that we do need to recognise and record in our findings of this meeting.  You have been I think in this meeting as in many others, very broadly inclusive in your invitations and there has been a very relevant response.  We should take very clear notice of who is here.  I have no doubt in my own field for example, that if you had chosen to hold this hearing in Hong Kong or in Acapulco, or in Vancouver, every single professor of psychiatry would have been here with lavish support from every drug company that they phoned the day before without question.  Those who claimed in their initial - those institutions and individuals who apologised that somehow with some sort of scatoma, some temporary blindness they didn't notice with apartheid was happening are in fact showing by their absence that whatever blindness they had, they still have, they are still as comprehensively blind as that.  I think we have to be wary of how these individuals have learned this new language, the 12th official language of South Africa, political correct speak.  And some of them make those same noises just as convincingly but don't listen to what they say, look at what they do and I remember, I wish I could remember the great author who said it, that the man who said, 'I can't hear what you're saying because what you are is shouting so loudly', and I think that is what our absent colleagues have said and we should hear what they have said.

In the past like we said we were not here to engage about a power struggles between the disciplines and so on at the competitions but for the mere fact that the nurses are here today also and did say their say.  It means we are heading for the same direction, there is hope, more especially about us recurriculating and having this trans-interdisciplinary teaching which we are planning so that there is no discipline which will be above any other.

I think in summary for myself it's been a fruitful two days, just gleaning a lot of knowledge around what is happening in the field, but I think I have questions on a much more practical level at many times and that is 1, the implementing body that is to follow the work of the TRC.  How is that body being put together, what will they be doing, how much of a profile will they be given?  The TRC's been given a very high profile, how are we going to also place the same emphasis and importance on this implementing body because where the real long haul of the work of our country is going to be in trying to bring that reconciliation and that transformation.  We've got a long road ahead of us in that regard and I think here we're talking about the mental health of our society and the well-being if you want to us that word but that's a future looking thing but it's a long road before us.  How are we looking at rebuilding this country and I think again practically what we need to do is continue to highlight what's happening on local levels in communities, small, seemingly maybe low budget and somewhat insignificant that aren't getting exposure, where communities are really working with the hard issues and I'll just name a few of those; the Video Dialogue Project in the East Rand which is using video, having taken an SDU and an SPU commander and given them a video camera and they've gone and told their story from their side with their constituencies with their families, then came together to try to put joint video together and then the process now is after that joint video which was a process of reconciliation just for the two of them and a process of growth and healing, is their having public viewings and these public viewings are bringing the community together to view this joint story that they've written now and then they break in to commissions and begin to talk about what is the future, how do we build the community that was fractured in the past in so many ways?   There would be other examples, I'm just going to leave it with that but we need to highlight that, these examples and we need to pick up on them. I think it's about humanising this whole thing, really making this a human thing.  The network that I'm with is about seeing how can we bring communities or individuals together who represent survivors and perpetrators, how do we bring them together and talk on the human level?  Because some of the breakthrough in transmission is not going to happen until we get into the heart of those who have been part of the process.",

I think many of us are disappointed and I include myself that the TRC isn't called Budget Unlimited because I think that often when people come to this kind of process there is the hope that all of the needs would in fact be satisfied.  I think particularly this committee should probably be labelled the most limited budget committee in all of the TRC from what I can gather but what is important for me is that in June and here this process stimulated a lot of activity that may be quite hidden from view and from the discussions that we're having here and I know there are processes going on in Cape Town as a result of that because I'm based there and I've also made links with people, I've already discussed bringing out a special issue of the South African Journal of Psychology and doing different writings and so on.  So there are other things that are going on as a result of it and I think that the TRC process was also meant to be a process that stimulates something rather than completely sees to everything that the whole nation could probably require.  And I know that particular responsibilities lie outside of the TRC, especially the ones that you've mentioned but I think the one responsibility that the TRC might be evading and I think is central to its responsibility is to secure all of the data, all of the information, all of the resources that you have brought together up to now for the future use of the nation and that is I think, very much of your responsibility and not agencies outside of the TRC.

But I've wondered where they were, actually not only the psychiatrists but I've wondered where they were, the mental health workers, you know the people who understand the distresses of people, the people who know how a road from one point to change or to healing goes, how they have been very very scarce in the community.  How they have not been in the media. I mean I know the society had very resourceful people but in situations like this you'd want to see them out there in the media talking, analysing about what is happening, analysing the TRC itself, the processes, the religiosities, the beliefs and the professionalism, analysing the society generally on what it's about; going into philosophies.

Internally within the Commission Zina has worked very hard trying to bring all of you here.  Unfortunately she couldn't participate in this process because she's preparing briefers for the next hearings which are coming up on Monday; Winnie Madikizela hearing, so she's very busy but I would like to thank her in absentia.\n Sorry I didn't see her, I asked her why she was so quiet and then she said she'd be in and out and so I thought she was out.\n(Indistinct comment from panel member)  Maybe that's another reason why she's hiding.  And having said that, also maybe if I can just respond to some of the concerns regarding the first hearings we had in May/June and these ones, I remember at one time I flew down to Durban. We went through a process of going around talking to grouping about what we are going to do and at the end we ended up with a few, the people who saw were really the people who responded; and as a Commission we have come to accept that, that not to say each time we like people to come and interact with us they will all be available.  We have come to accept that many people who have a willingness and a desire to make a contribution it's sometimes almost impossible especially at this point in time when people who are in positions of power are overstretched. I mean I will take a good example.  I don't want to mention anyone boldly but people who are really likely to take over some of the processes, they couldn't come. We heard that they are here, they are in Cape Town, they are in this meeting so it says a lot about where we are as a country and how stretched we are.  I'm not using that as a defence but that's a strong factor.  Just coming to organising this one I didn't know that Saths Cooper will come.  We insisted that we stick to the things which we have thought of.  We couldn't get somebody from the Department of Health, we couldn't get somebody from the Medical and Dental Council.  Initially we thought they would be represented by Saths but the answer was he might not be available.  We decided to have the topic in any way.  By chance he walked in when we started.  So that's, I'm referring to him because he made it, otherwise I wouldn't like the Media to say the TRC expected so and so and he didn't come.  \n So that was another factor that many people who had even agreed and made a commitment that they will come, they didn't come.\n Regarding communication within the TRC, some of you might have seen our booklet called The Truth Talk.  We came up with that booklet mainly because we felt we needed a simplest way of communicating with our staff and NGO's, you can pick it up anywhere but you heard that some people said that they don't know what the Committee is doing, and after each Commission meeting, whenever policies are approved by the Commission we come back and all the officers they are going through a same process, Committees Report to Staff from a housekeeper to a Commissioner in another committee. We report, we say look here are our policy proposals, they have been approved, workshops are put up, publicised internally and externally but it just happened that all the time people feel left out.  So that's not a justification but it's something which we have come to live with.\n Coming to this specific workshop, or maybe before coming to it, also something which I think is important to share with you, as a Commission I should think we have also realised that we symbolise a difficult part which people don't know how to interact with; people get angry at us, they get frustrated, it's a very frustrating structure.  People live with this love and hate sort of feeling.  Sometimes they are excited that the truth is coming to the fore but sometimes it's extremely frustrating in the sense that it forces them to visit the memory of the past.  Our Committee in particular has suffered mainly because of the things which were discussed here, the status of the profession per se and how our profession somehow colluded with the previous government in human rights violation.  As you heard how for instance our theories of racism informed the whole apartheid system and all those things, our Committee becomes a symbol of this bad past and time and again those reflections they end up stifling our work and compromise what the Committee's capable of doing, and I think it's something which we have realised that it's very very important to communicate with professional bodies because if we as a professional grouping don't act on those issues, in terms of making sure that there's an internal mechanism to deal with those colleagues who were part of the system, who colluded in human rights violations and making sure that also we have a strong culture of human rights within our profession, our profession is likely to suffer even more.\n Well when we started yesterday, I will remind you of what we said; we said we have had quite a number of people coming before us who had made statements but who had expressed difficult emotions like anger, depression, suffering, complicated grief and all those difficult emotions which go with the past, and we said it's difficult for us to name what we are dealing with; we are not too keen to diagnose those people because we know those are people who are people who were functioning at a high level, they were leaders.  If I might steal some of the words which have emerged from this workshop that those people need to be affirmed, that was our feeling as well, that those were not just people who were mental ill but strong leaders who for some reason where their bones were broken by the previous government because of the positions they held and their beliefs.  So I should think also we're concerned about a body which will look after them and I'm just picking up those tow because those were two pressing points in our own minds but reflecting on what has emerged here, especially just taking from the reports that we have had from working groups, it's like out of this workshop there is an awareness that the whole question of mental health needs to be looked at very carefully in the sense that it's not mental health in a traditional sense of the word where people are thinking about pathology, but it's a search for an environment which is conducive to peoples' well-being.  Of course people here who have looked at survivors of human rights violation as we have them today and also people who will suffer because of the legacies of the past, people like the question of people who's rights will be violated or who will be abused by let's say perpetrators. So that also has been very very helpful for us to broaden a scope of understanding what is in our data base.\n And reflecting on what was said I should think that we accept a challenge that as a Commission we have a very limited capacity, especially to investigate allegations that there are documents out there which were written up by experts in our field which are likely to perpetuate discrimination, racism and beliefs about other people that they are less human and they can be treated anyhow.  I mean as we have said, if we can be given specific names of those documents, we'll be keen to have a look at them.  \n The question of professionals who in the past used their expertise in oppressing detainees, it's also a very difficult one especially in instances where it is said they are still in positions of, some of them in positions of power and influence within a new dispensation.  Again because of our limited capacity to investigate, it's a question of really appealing to people that look, if you have names that will make the lives of the investigative unit much much easier. And also the question of the body which will take over; already we have recommended that the body which follow up all the recommendations of the TRC should be the President's office.  The reason why I mean a comment was that body should have a similar clout so to say, political clout; I should think the President's office, we thought is a critical body because it has the highest authority and a level of accountability in terms of what is done for survivors of human rights violations and also what he matched that there should be a special consideration of people like in other countries.  I should think that office is in the best position to really push and make sure that in a work place, in public life in general for a limited period of time, people who are survivors of human rights violations  are given special treatment.  I know of course some people will question that but given the motivation which we had, it makes a lot of sense to us, especially the fact that that can go on for a limited period of time.\n Regarding the question of the body, although there have been different proposals, in some instances it was like people were opposed to each other.  I should think basically we appreciate the view that there should be an interministerial or interdepartmental cooperation in addressing these issues and I agree with you that maybe a proposal that we need a human service department might be too radical, given the fact that already government ministries have initiated new plans in this era.  \n So from our point of view a lot of suggestions which have been generated here we will take forward and incorporate them with our thinking and limit ourselves to our mandate and we are hoping that representatives of professional bodies here will make sure that the debate continues because after we have made our recommendations the very professional bodies which are in existence today, will have a responsibility to monitor and to take forward some of the suggestions.\n I've left out an important question of the kind of research which will enable as many people as possible to generate questions around this process after the life of the Commission and what has been suggested especially around the good example which was raised now of a video-dialogue project.  I should think it adds to what was said earlier on using poems and all other moods, story-telling of communication that we need to be creative and make sure that as many people as possible are part of the process of telling their stories and revisiting their past.  And also an important suggestion which we hope it won't be lost and we have noted that it is the idea of having something similar to a holocaust museum.  We have noted that and fortunately the Ministry of Arts and Culture, they seem to be positive to the idea and are wanting to start from the past and link it up with the rainbow nation, what is happening today during this era.  \n So I will really like to thank you very much, especially people who came from KwaZulu Natal and the Western Cape, Lion and Nicholas and A...(indistinct) Bhana, we thank you very much for coming, not to say we don't value the Gautengers but we really appreciate, especially I know at this point in time universities are very busy preparing marks for students but we thought this is important enough, so thank you.",
