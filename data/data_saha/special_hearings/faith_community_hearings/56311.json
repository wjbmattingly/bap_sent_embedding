Where we participate   in involvement, but when situations or resources are made available, we have   been made to experience a very bitter situation because we are unable to address   these problems that we are faced with because the problem is we are unable to   raise fast enough good resources, but where we should get resources, we experience   bitter, bitter, bitter, treatment when it comes to having such help.

We could have even ploughed on that plot, there was a house and electricity   and water, but one other Bishop turned it down and said no, this is a farm,   this is out. You know there were very few Cuckoos there then, but now when you   go to Orange Farm, you see that we missed an opportunity of having established   a centre there that would cater for the African Independent Institute what have   you, and we do have CAIC which was the brainchild of both of us and we begged   with TEEC that they give us ...[inaudible] that we start this one for our people,   because they haven't got a standard of education so as for them to take theological   studies with the TEEC, most of our people in the SACC know about this.

            "Mr Chairman of the TRC, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the team   and the house, we thank you for this opportunity granted us. We really are grateful   to the Lord for having given us this chance. As women to come and present to   this aghast team how we feel about the situation within the church. I am here   to make a submission from the women's perspective within the faith communities.   I am honoured to represent such a large body of people, but need to say that   I represent them primarily from the present point of view. The group that met   to discuss and draw up the submission were all christians. We were given very   little time to prepare this document. It was approximately four days, thus precluding   us from being a consultative and inclusive, as we should have liked.\nAll religions are patriarchal based on the rules of the fathers. This was reinforced   by the missionaries. The legacy of this tradition is that women remain largely   powerless and voiceless. In the christian tradition, spirituality has largely   been the preserve of men. The language of prayer and worship is generally male.   The symbols and images of God are male. The scriptures have been used to promote   male dominance. The ruling sexes of the church are predominantly male. There   is prevailing male consciousness. This is somewhat of an anomaly, as the congregations   are predominantly female. Women are excluded from christian religious language,   in hymns, liturgy and scriptures, people are referred to as men. The sons of   God, or brothers, not to mention the militaristic language commonly used too.   The language for God is predominantly male. Of course you will hear Lord, King,   Master and Father. Not only do these terms entrench patriarchy, but they are   also the terms of the ruling class. God is represented as a ruling, controlling   male, thus the male is seen as more fully representative of God than the female. \nI believe that this male language and imagery has contributed to the churches   sanctioning of men dominating women. The early church shaped much of the Christian   thoughts which we carry around with us today, much of it plainly misogynist.   Women are misbegotten males, painted evils and devils doorways. The great tragedy   is that some women have come to believe this of themselves. There is very little   affirmation for those women who struggle within the church structure from other   women. Women need to encourage and support one another as we seek to find affirmation   in the scriptures. When we look in the book of the first Timothy, Chapter 2   verses 11 - 15 and allow me to share this because it really bothers us \"Women   should learn in silence and all humility. I did not allow them to teach or have   authority over men. They must keep quiet.\" The scripture is used as justification   for the denial of equality of women within the church, but surely the passage   on baptism which is found in Galatians Chapter 3, and that needs to be corrected   because there is a misprint in what we submitted. Verses 27 - 28 \"You   were baptised into union with Christ and now you are clothed so to speak with   the life of Christ himself. So there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles,   between slaves and free men, between men and women. You are all one in union   with Christ Jesus\"\nThese verses give another perspective on the position of women with God's kingdom.   The patriacal nature of church structures regrettably has condoned, encouraged   and in some cases, actively enforced the subjugation of women to men, denying   them the revelation of their full potential, not only within the church, but   politically, socially and economically. It is a matter of debate that our new   political constitution grants women far more status than any religious one.   Our clergy need to be trained in the understanding of the rights now legally   granted to us constitutionally but withheld from us spiritually. We celebrate   the changes that are taking place and acknowledge that women are being ordained   as ministers, priests and elders within some of our faith communities. However,   it should be noted that there are no female Bishops, moderators or Archbishops,   so decisions taken with regard to issues pertaining specifically to women remain   within the male domain. Things like abortion, rape, birth control, etc. Within   one denomination with the ordination of female clergy, despite the fact that   this was a majority decision, a conscience clause was introduced. This allows   that no congregant was to feel obliged to have a female priest within their   congregation or to be served the sacrament by a women. If a women was to serve   the sacrament, this fact was to be advertised in advance and a member of the   male clergy was to be available as an alternative for those who preferred. The   offensiveness of this clause is quite breathtaking! One can imagine the uproar   that would have ensued if this sort of clause had been instituted when the racial   barriers started coming down. There have been reports of sexual harassment of   women by male clergy. When these incidents are brought to the attention of other   male clergy, they are largely ignored. Or hushed up so that the church is not   brought into disrepute. Women have complained that on seeking pastoral care   and advice from male clergy with regard to abusive marriages, they are often   sent back to these abuses and sometimes life threatening relationships with   the command to forgive and live out their faith in a way that would change their   husbands. I don't know how. \nThe church endorses the abuse of women in the home and fails in the patoral   care of these women, often their children too. Faith communities often support   or turn a blind eye to cultural and traditional customs that entrench suppression   and oppression of women. The cry, \"But it's our tradition, it's our culture.\"   Is used to maintain the status quo. The church was instrumental in bringing   about the abolition of slavery. Why is it so tardy in emancipating women? It   is a sad reflection on our faith that in keeping women in spiritual bondage,   men themselves are not fully free. Our clergy need to be ...[indistinct] to   the issue of women within the church. There needs to be a greater sensitivity   to the needs, aspirations and rights of women within our different faiths and   denominations. Our men need to unlearn many of the things that have consciously   and unconsciously learned at their father's knees, reinforced by the church's   patriarchal attitude. Men are discouraged at every level of their lives from   recognising their own feminine attributes as though they were something of which   to be ashamed or had no worth. Sometimes you will hear someone saying, \"don't   cry, did you ever hear your father cry?\" In so doing, they deny themselves   the richness and fullness that God has created in us. It needs to be acknowledged   that women often support and sustained their oppression. They accept without   question or challenge the view of God's love for them, taught largely from a   totally biased and subjective theology. They sometimes allow themselves to be   co-opted, which often results in them behaving like men, to the detriment of   all, as well as the kingdom of God. Patriarchy has been so internalised that   women will often vote for men in their absence. \nEducation systems and curricular need to be received and revised within our   seminaries and religious institutions. Why is God acknowledged as God of Abraham,   Isaac and Jacob and never of Sarah, Rachel and Rebecca. The new testament with   its male trinity has denied us all the understanding and experience of the nurturing   care of our creator and has denied women the same sex identity with God. Jesus   described God as a woman looking for a lost coin and as a woman sweeping, looking   the lost, our saviour discussed theology with the women at the well, healed   a women on the Sabbath, listened to women and stayed in their homes. Sought   the kingdom with them, and received anointing from a women. Rebuked a man who   scorned her on the day after the crucifixion, it was a women who went to the   tomb, physically weak, to roll away the stone, but strong in faith and trusting   that God would provide whatever was needed for her task. It was to this women   that the risen cried with the message, \"Go and tell the good news\". \nThe book of Ephesians, chapter 5, verses 22 to 24 needs to be read in the context   of verse 21 and verse 25 to 30. \"Wives submit to your husbands as to the   Lord. For a husband has authority over his wife, just as Christ has authority   over the church. And Christ is himself the saviour of the church, his body,   and so wives must submit completely to their husbands, just as the church submits   itself to Christ\" Verse 21 says \"Submit yourselves to one another   because of your reverence for Christ\". I think we need to revisit some   of these chapters so that we can see how applicable they can be in our situation.   Verse 25 reads \"Husbands love your wives, just as Christ loved the church.   He gave his life for it. He did this to dedicate the church to God by his word   after making it clean by washing it in water.\" When studying the scriptures,   three things should be borne in mind who wrote the passage? What was the context   within which the passage was written? How old was the person writing the passage?\nMarriage vows need to be examined and expounded to words that perpetuate the   subjugation of women. It is demeaning and degrading to ask all if one part of   our faith community is opposed in this fashion. There exists a classism and   racism with the church that has resulted in a differentiation of the facilities   provided for pastors. And here I speak as a pastor's wife, your Honour. Usually   with an urban bias. Though aimed at the clergy, it also has resulted in the   suffering of indignities by the spouse and this is done overwhelmingly. (and   the children). Lack of adequate sewerage, water and other basic needs are common,   especially in rural areas. Urban areas differentiate between townships and suburban   facilities thus reinforcing classism and inevitably, racism. The wives of clergy   are often exposed to conscious and unconscious patriarchy that would make a   weaker person buckle at the knees. Whilst studying, their husbands are accommodated   in seminaries, spouses and their children are not. Often living in conditions   that are simply disgraceful because of poor or non-existent stipends. Little   or no training is offered to wives to equip them for the contribution that make   to their husband's ministry. There is little choice in the matter of wives'   ministry. The expectation of the congregation, the denomination of the ministers   themselves is that wives will participate actively and fully in the lives and   work of the congregation or parish. Ministers are called. They have vocations.   Wives are not recognised for their contribution they make, called or not.\nMinisters wives, often professional people, have little choice in the decision   to work or not. Their financial contribution to the family often exceeds that   of their spouses and is often what keeps the family clothed, fed and educated.   Should their husbands predecease them, they lose their homes. If provision has   not been made to purchase a home prior to his death. Given the stipends most   clergy are paid, the chances of that having taken place are usually remote.   Newly widowed and homeless and usually with a family to provide for, what support   can this woman expect from the church. Often marginalised and isolated by their   position as the Minister's wife and neglected by their husbands because of church   commitment, many of them are lonely and depressed. With the new political constitution,   many young single professional women are no longer members of church groups,   simply because of the lowly status granted to them within the church compared   with the status they are being afforded in business, commerce and industry.   These young women realised that they are achieving key positions in secular   society, long denied them within the church. Their voices are being heard finally   and they are making meaningful decisions, but not within the church. Although   women have had no authority within the church, they have had a profound influence.   Women and women's organisations have made a significant and valuable contribution   to the lives and work of their denominations, especially in areas concerning   family and social issues. Their service has brought no positions of responsibility,   outside the domestic. For example, women raise much of the church funds, but   are not in a position to decide how these funds should be allocated. That important   decision is made by the male church council. It should be noted that Gert van   Manen, General Manager of the Ecumenical Development Co-operative Society, which   is the financial department of the World Council of Churches had this to say   at a conference on sustainable development, which was spearheaded by the South   African Council of Churches in April 1996, and I quote \"Our recovery raid   on loans lending to the poorest of the poor, is 90% the highest of any financial   institution in the world. We emphasis women participation. Women never let their   children down. If school fees, shoes and food on their children depended on   the success of the business, women will fight for it. Their commitment is ...[inaudible]   as compared with males, whose commitment is often more entrepreneurial\".   There is a need for true emancipation within our denominations. We need to examine   our teaching of the scriptures to free them of gender bias. Our political constitution   enshrines freedom expressed in the scriptures, but not applied in practice.   Attitudes of male clergy and leaders within church organisations need to reflect   what is written, but not lived out in our religious lives. If only it was understood   that if any of your wives remain in subjugation, then none of us are truly free.   Women and men are created to co-operate with, and compliment one another. Not   to be in perpetual competition with one another. Eve was created from Adam's   rib, not from his heel to be trampled on. Nor from his head to be over him,   but from his side, that we may walk together in partnership, in support and   encouragement of one another. If women sound shrill and militant at times, it   is because we are not heard and so little recognition of our work and value   as God's creation is accorded us. There are faith communities represented at   this hearing whose female believers are not allowed to worship in the same area   as their husbands, fathers, brothers and sons. They are separated from the fullness   and richness of their spiritual and family life. Not because of sin or omission   or commission, but merely because of their gender. They are absolutely voiceless   and powerless and suffer denigration and humiliation because they are women.   God hears the cries of the oppressed. When will we?\nIn closing, Chairperson, we wish to share this creed which we as women feel   could be encouraging not only us but the total change. The creed is thus We   believe in God who created women and men in God's image. [Tape 4] [inaudible]   created the world and gave both sexes the care of the earth. We believe in Jesus,   child of God, chosen by God born of a woman, Mary, who listened to women and   stayed in their homes. Who looked for the kingdom with them, who was followed   and supported by women disciples. We believe in Jesus who discussed theology   with the woman at the well, who received anointing from a woman at Simon's house   and rebuked the man guest who scorned her. We believe in Jesus who healed a   woman on the Sabbath, who spoke of God as a woman seeking a lost coin, as a   woman swept, seeking the lost. We believe in Jesus who thought of pregnancy   and birth with reverence. We believe in Jesus, who appeared first to Mary Magadalena   and sent her with the message, \"Go and tell\". We believe in the wholeness   of God, in whom there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, female nor male,   for we are one in God. We believe in the Holy Spirit as she moves over the waters   of creation and over the earth, the woman's spirit of God who created us and   gave us birth and covers us with her wings. Amen. \nWe thank your Honour for this opportunity.",

I think we want to acknowledge the quite   outstanding contribution of women, both in the church and in the time of our   struggle and as Joyce was saying, one has been struck by the fact that women   coming forward to testify and somebody has pointed out that mostly when they   have come to testify, they have come to tell about what happened to somebody   else, whereas whenever men came they have come to tell us what happened to themselves. \nWe have certainly I have, become increasingly aware that without women our   liberation would not have happened and I want to salute the women folk and to   pay a very warm tribute to the.

I think that things that you raised about   sexist language and so onI am always a little amused that women get very   upset when you say \"God, he\" have you ever heard any women worry when   you say of the Devil, \"He\"? They don't mind, I mean you can be as   sexist as you like, they think they agree that the devil is a he.

            "Even though my speech is prepared in English I will speak in   Zulu, because most of my congregation consists of people who cannot speak English.   I will speak English now and again. First of all I want to apologise that I   am here on my own. I am from a very big congregation. We had a problem, because   we received our invitation quite late. The people that were meant to come with   me were not able to do so.\nI wish to extend our humble gratitude to the National Chairperson of the TRC   for having deemed it proper for us to participate in the faith communities hearings   of the sufferings, humiliations and oppressions undergone by various communities   during the apartheid era. As you all might be aware, Ibandla lama Nazaretha   is a unique church. It is ironic that whilst it is one of the biggest churches   founded by Africans, it is the most easily forgotten when it comes to matters   affecting the nation. Maybe it is due to its over simplicity and humility which   has dominated its leadership for decades. It is therefore no wonder that it   was only on the 12th November 1997, that we learned that we were also invited   to these hearings. For the sake of those who have no background of this church,   I will first briefly outline the source of its existence, its teachings and   beliefs and thereafter the sufferings, humiliations and oppressions it experienced   during the Apartheid period. Without the mentioning of the name Shembe, Ibandla   lama Nazaretha is non-existent. The name Shembe, apart from the fact that it   is a surname, was the name given to the prophet, Isiah Shembe, by his grandfather,   Ntliziyo. The followers of the prophet, Isiah Shembe are therefore commonly   known by the outsiders as the Shembeites, or Ibandla lakwa Shembe. The prophet   Isiah Shembe was born at Ntaba Mhlope in the district of Escort in Kwa Zulu   in about 1865 and when he was about 9 years old, his parents moved to Ntabaza   in the district of Harrismith, where he grew up till marriage. The prophet was   born from the traditional rural Zulus who belonged to no church faith. He never   attended school from his boyhood, and until he was about 15 years old, he had   never been in contact with Christians, nor had he ever seen or heard of the   bible. At his early boyhood, he had many visions which came to him in the form   of a voice from the firmament. Before Isiah Shembe knew anything about Christianity   or the bible, he spoke of God with whom he claimed to be in communication, who   he knew as Inkosi or ...[inaudible]. This voice which usually came with thunder   and lightening directed his life and was the source of all the teachings and   beliefs he, at a later stage, instilled in the minds of his followers. Later,   when Isiah Shembe had already been in communication with his God, he met the   bible. Through the mysterious powers of his revelations, he was able to read   it basing his understanding of it on the visionary messages he received from   Umbeli Nqangi. Although later he was in contact with the Christians, he never   relied on the Christian interpretation of the bible, but he read and understood   it as he was guided by the visionary messages. The prophet, although from his   boyhood he was always in communication with God, he never joined any church   until he got married according to Zulu custom. After having married his fourth   wife, God ordered him to leave all his wives, his children and the family at   large an follow him. This Shembe eventually complied with. From that time, Isiah   Shembe became the greatest prophet this country ever produced. \nIn 1910, he came to Natal still preaching the word of God, healing and performing   all kinds of miracles in his ministry. In 1911 he founded his mission station   at Inanda, near Durban, called Ipakamini, which became the headquarters of his   church. In 1913 he was led by the Holy Spirit to Ntlagagazi which is a distance   of about 80 km from Durban. From that year to this day, AmaNazaretha barefootedly   take this pilgrimage in hundreds thousands or millions yearly, to worship God   on the Mount Ntlagagazi for the period of two weeks. As I have pointed out earlier,   Ibandla lama Nazaretha is very unique if one approaches is from the Christian   perspective. Because, although AmaNazaretha use the bible in their teachings,   Isiah Shembe as a prophet did not regard the bible as his sole authority of   his teachings, but as a reference to his main authority, which is God. As a   prophet, Isiah Shembe was converted by no man, but by God. The bible was there   to support and confirm his authority. It is therefore through this that it is   not very correct to categorise Ibandla lama Nazaretha as one of the independent   churches. It was never a part of any Christian teachings, but it is part of   the biblical teachings we built through the might of the almighty. This church   can also not be categorised under traditional religions, for the simple reason   that whilst traditional religions based their teachings on \"Izwelabantu\"   which is the voice of the people, Ibandla lama Nazaretha bases its teachings   on \"IzweleZulu\" which is the voice of heaven which came to the prophet,   and through him spread to the all the people. The prophet explored the name,   AmaNazaretha, to its biblical roots as being the only name given by God to the   believers, namely the Nazareths. The prophet outlawed the drinking of any beverages   including beer or sorghum beer. He also outlawed smoking of any kind, albeit   they are part of African tradition, for they are incompatible with laws relating   to the Nazareths. Isiah Shembe regarded beer drinking and smoking as health   hazards and not suitable for AmaNazaretha. He further outlawed pre-marital sexual   intercourse, the use of medicine as a form of healing, the practice of divination   or sorcery, the use of mediums or spirits, although these form part of African   traditions. For such practices are repugnant to biblical teachings. Isiah Shembe   allowed polygamy and when confronted by Christians, his reply was simply this   \"I was not sent by man, but by God and God did not tell me of a sin called   polygamy. Those who sin are the ones who divorce and thereafter take another   wife\".\nFrom its inception, this church under its founder and subsequent successors   in leadership, grew very fast and as Mrs Wells confirmed in her manuscript entitled   Shembe, and I quote \"Everywhere, chapels and churches and schools were   empty as Shembe approached and the people crowded to listen with great joy.   Immorality was driven to shame. Mental snobbery was pricked like a bubble and   a simple folk wearing skins or next to nothing accepted the gospel with great   joy and were baptised. Then the greatest enemy were the missionaries who then   waged warfare against Shembe because they said he was undoing much, if not most   of what they had done. They had taught people to wear clothes and now Shembe   said it did not matter if the people wore little or nothing, if they were modest   and clean.\" This warfare against Shembe by the missionaries had a very   negative impact on the growth of this church. Because of the short time given   to me to prepare for this hearing, I am unable to give all the specific incidents   that led to the suffering, scorn, persecution and false representations against   the church from the time of the prophet to this day. The missionaries had vowed   to wipe it from existence and in so doing, they agitated the government of the   day to stop all its activities. For example it is a fact that there were laws   which were passed in Natal forbidding the Shembe to enter the black reserve,   if he did not have permission from the Magistrate. And the Durban municipality   forbade him to enter the locations. All Shembe's moves were closely monitored   for his was not regarded as a church, but a political movement under the cloak   of religion. As Mrs Wells further revealed, Shembe was much hated by the missionaries.   She further stated \"I remember a certain European superintendent of missions   meeting outside Town Hall in Durban and accusing and denouncing Shembe with   much hate. He brought his clenched fist down in his open palm and affirmed 'Shembe   works those wonders through the power of the devil!'. Have you ever seen Shembe,   or have you been present at healing services, I asked him. 'No' said the Superintendent,   \"and I don't want to see him. All I want and intend to do is to crush him   out of existence\".\nThe government, through the influence of the missionaries was in important,   wanted to crush this church out of existence. Shembe was told in no uncertain   terms that his was not a church. In 1931 he was called to Pietermaritzburg,   where he was told to demolish all his church settlements, that he was not allowed   to build any church house or to use the church bells in calling people to the   church service. It therefore came to pass that the Nazareths developed a culture   of worshipping God whilst seated under the trees and calling people to the church   service by shouting loudly, up to this day. \nAs I pointed out the church had long been instructed never to build church   houses or to establish any further church settlements. The church was ordered   to demolish even those houses which were already existing. In 1950, the successor   in leadership, the Lord of ...[inaudible] built a big church house at ...[inaudible]   with the installation of a church bell. He was then confronted by local missionaries   and was again reminded that his was a not a church and therefore the building   of that church house and the installation of the bell was repugnant to the government.   The church building and bell was then confined to a ...[inaudible] only. The   question facing the church was how to spread its gospel in the face of the government's   restrictions. The prophet had instructed his son and successor in leadership,   Johannes, to take many wives. According to Zulu custom, the man is entitled   to establish his home when he has a wife, and a man can have as many homes as   his wife. Whenever Johannes Galile Shembe wanted to establish a church settlement,   he pointed out that he was a man with many children and he wanted the land for   his children. When the land was then allocated to him, it became a church settlement   and the government was unable to attach him, as the home was always registered   in his personal name, so was everything that belonged to the church because   the church was not recognised as a church. The struggle in favour of the church   recognition was fought for years until in 1985, when the church joined RICA   and was assisted by Bishop R.P.B. Mbwela. \nThe death of the prophet Isiah Shembe in 1935 brought in great joy among the   missionaries in Natal. Their aim as the superintendent had vowed was to see   to it that no only Shembe was dead, but that everything about him was intact   with his bones. They met and discussed the matter and thereafter sent to Galile   Shembe a very prominent black leader, Dr L. Dube to convince the successor in   leadership that it was not worth his education to lead Ibandla lama Nazaretha   which is full of amaQaba, or heathens. As Galile once put it in his sermons,   and I quote, \"After my father's death there were many people who advised   me to abandon this church and join the Wesley Church or American Board. They   promised me money to go overseas, where I was to be trained as a minister so   that I could come back and become their priest. This church of your father is   wrong, it takes people away from the path of God. The first person to say this   was a black man. He said, these people will give you trouble for they are not   educated, you will not be able to lead them. After two months I met a white   man in Durban who knew my father. He said, 'Is it you who took over from the   work of Shembe?', I said yes. He then said, 'No man, what can you do, you cannot   rule black people. Black people always fight. By the way, you say that you do   not drink liquor, you shall see that all of them drink. And if you talk to them,   they will fight you. Leave this people, if you want to be a priest, go to American   Board, or to the Wesley Church and be a priest there. I did not reply to this   white man, but I wondered how his talk came to be the same as that of the black   man who had come to tell me the same story.\"\nWhen they realised that they were failing to persuade Galile Shembe to abandon   the church, they devised another plan aimed at a complete annihilation of the   prophet and his work form the face of the earth. The story was systematically   concocted that the self styled prophet, an impostor, Isiah Shembe told his followers   that like the prophet Elijah, would be taken to heaven by a heavenly chariot.   He then took his followers to Mount Ntlangakazi to see him fly to heaven. When   he was on the mountain, he attached feathers to his body and when he jumped   from the mountain, trying to fly, he fell on the rocks an died. He was caricatured   in local newspapers read by black society as another ...[inaudible] who had   led many blacks astray. At schools which were controlled by the missionaries,   the story of Shembe trying to fly was told as a historic fact. We know that   children daily suffer the scorn, humiliation and mental trauma by this everyday   insult hurled against us, not only by the children, but by our class teachers,   our principals, and local priests who came to conduct morning prayers at school.   What caused a lot of conflict in us was that we did not know whether the story   or not, for it was being told by our teachers, whilst at home it was refuted   by our parents. When we reported the story to our parents they became so bitter,   and like my mother would start weeping soberly and at the end we all found ourselves   weeping. \nLike many other children who ended up leaving the school, there was a stage   where I also wondered whether it was worth it for me to continue with schooling,   because of the scorn I constantly received from the teachers because of Shembe.   This ridicule and harassment of the other children at schools caused many of   our children at lower classes or backslid from the church, so for a long time,   the church became known as the church of the uneducated. Apart form the scorn   about Isiah Shembe's allegedly attempted flight to heaven, the Nazareth children,   like all the Nazareths do not shave their hair or beard. Any resistance to shave   was met with severe corporal punishment and other teachers used to roughly cross   shave them so that at the end they looked more or less like Mr T. And we were   told to go Shembe schools, which were non-existent. Since shaving is strongly   tabooed in the church, the forceful removal of their hair is tantamount to the   denial of their faith. This cruel treatment by many teachers, which still occurs   even today, caused other parents to take their children out of school. The Nazareths   usually do not marry according to Christian rights, for polygamy is allowed   in the church. What therefore happens is that to complete marriage, the Nazareth   has to undergo three phases. Firstly, the waiting is ceremonised in the church   by the priest, but that marriage is not recognised by the government. The second   phase is the traditional wedding which is ceremonised by the chief witness who   has no interest in that wedding. These outsiders usually come drunk to that   wedding and make it nothing more than a mockery. The third phase is that the   bride and bridegroom's parents and the chief witness have to go to the marriage   office to have the marriage registered. The priest from the church is irrelevant.   Isiah Shembe, as a prophet taught his people to respect the authorities, but   promised that through our constant prayer and supplication to God, one day God   will answer our prayers. In 1920 he composed a Sabbath liturgy, which he instructed   the Nazareths that it would be read before God three times every Sabbath day   from generations to generations. In the introduction of the liturgy he wrote   that it is the hymn of the Sabbath, the hymn of remembrance from generation   to generation and the hymn of fasting in order to remind God of our suffering.   Isiah Shembe also taught that the Nazareth must lead a simple life and that   every year they must walk on foot to Mount Intlangazasi, to worship God and   report all their sufferings. So, for AmaNazaretha, whenever they were confronted   by the government, for other missionary churches, all they had to do was to   ask the congregation to kneel down and have Isiguqa, which is a special prayer   to God. Having said all this, it is important that we show the way forward.   On behalf of my church, I now extend my hand of friendship to all those who   made us suffer and in the words of Jesus Christ, we say forgive them Lord for   they did not know what they were doing. \nOn Sunday afternoon when the TRC national Chairperson, Archbishop Desmond Tutu   was conducting a church service, in his sermon he said that we are all partners   to God. We are here to assist God to mould this country and to make it fit living   here. In my view, the religious community and cannot fail to do this. If only   we would clearly understand what our mission is. This is irrespective of whether   we are Christians, Nazarites, Jews, Moslems, Hindus or traditional religions.   Our main mission is to work for God and working for God means doing what God   appreciates. Whilst we are liberated politically, we acknowledge that there   is a fast deterioration of humanity in our society, which is reaching an intolerable   level. We have to focus our attention as churches and faith communities on this   reality. As religious people, we must not allow ourselves to be too influenced   by political rhetorics which are only meant to win votes, but we must face the   truth. It is our duty as religious people in South Africa to put aside our religious   differences and to work for a common goal of making South Africa become a decent   country. In doing this, we have to look at the causes of our problems. It seems   to me that among us blacks there is a culture of indolence, lack of work ethics   and general irresponsibility, which we have to address without fail. We cannot   expect other people to do so, less they be labelled as racist. The greatest   enemy of a black man is liquor. As long as we are producing the generation of   drunkards, we can forget about a decent society. Drunkenness always goes hand   in hand with laziness, irresponsibility and uncouthness. We can think of many   projects, create many jobs, but unless we address this problem seriously, we   are just wasting our time. \nI would be failing in my duty as Shembe's representative if I were not to tell   the truth as he would if he were here today. It is quite interesting to listen   to other people confessing their sins and we tend to regard ourselves as holier   than thou, but time will tell and is already telling that there is a lot which   is lacking in black society. The greatest mistake we can make is to fail to   appreciate our weakness and keep on blaming others for all our inequities. A   person with that kind of attitude can never correct himself. There are issues   in black society which must be publicly addressed by blacks themselves without   fear. Apart from indulgence in liquor, the culture of indolence and general   lack of work ethic prevailing among our society is an issue we address very   seriously. We seem to be very good in uniting ourselves when we are going to   fight, when we are going to burn schools, or necklace other people, when we   are toyi-toying, when we strike for the reduction of work hours and six months'   maternity leave, but there is such a discord, quarrel and enmity amongst ourselves   when it comes to the real socio-economic development of our country. The taxi   industry is typical of what I am talking about. Why do these people keep on   killing each other? Why can't these people organise themselves peacefully, like   whites or Indians? The answer from the politicians is the legacy of apartheid   or the third force. My church has a very big following, which has now more or   less 5 million members. Because drinking liquor is strongly tabooed, I am very   proud to say without fear of contradiction that AmaNazaretha are among the most   hardworking, trustworthy and reliable people in the black society, where they   are in the majority. It is unfortunate that Christian denominations, unlike   the Muslims and other faith communities, for reasons not clear to me, only pay   lip service to this epidemic. Ibandla lama Nazaretha, unlike many Christian   churches, is able to recruit membership from different communities among the   blacks. The secret lies in its simplicity. A person does not have to think of   what dress, trousers, suit or shoes he must wear when coming to the church service.   All we emphasis is that he must be clean. If he is living at a place where there   is no water, he is still encouraged to come to the church service to listen   to the word of God. As Dr Bacon once put it, Ibandla lama Nazaretha is the foot   of an organic growth of Christianity on the African soil. An institution in   which the gospel message is incarnated into African culture, mentality and community   life and Africans are there to worship God in an African manner in order to   address the mentality and the needs of Africans in a way in which Africans sense   their spiritual and social needs. In Kwa Zulu Natal and Gauteng, when the Nazareths   are in big numbers, this church has converted many hostel dwellers, thus able   to unite the most of the sophisticated township people with the rural people.   Because the church addresses the hearts of the people, I have seen many warlords   not throwing away their sticks but changing their sticks into staffs, and using   these staffs for healing instead of beating. The shields used for fighting are   then used for dancing for the Lord. The war cry is then changed into praise   of the Almighty. In conclusion, I wish to say that we, as a church, shall endeavour   to appeal to the hearts of many to promote decency, hard work and self reliance   in developing our country.",

The one is to pay tribute to you for the   submission you have made before the commission, and the respect that you have   shown the commission by preparing yourself so extensively. This shows that you   are recognising the dignity of the Commission itself. \nSecondly I wanted to do my own personal confession before you and ask you to   forgive me. But I won't do that. I was student in 1969 at ...[inaudible] and   I used to pass by bus to Sbonelo and what you are saying about ridiculing and   laughing - all the insults about what we used to see as we passed through Phakamile,   as a boy I was part of that. I was a victim myself of my own upbringing and   somehow I would like to say so, if you could forgive me.\nTwo questions I want to raise with you. We are trying here to establish a picture   of what religious communities did or failed to do in the whole struggle with   apartheid. In your own submission, I would like to isolate perhaps you may have   passed through it quickly for you to isolate those things. When you look back,   you become proud of a contribution in the struggle against apartheid. \nSorry, and just so that I don't come back to you, and also very briefly just   to outline without going into detail, those things that you are sorry about.   Not generally, but about the struggle waged by this country to eliminate itself   from apartheid. Secondly I would like you to comment on the treatment that Ibandla   lama Nazaretha gives to women. You are taking the podium soon after the very   eloquent submission of how religious communities have really assaulted the dignity   of women.

Instead, we continued to worship   God using our own culture and tradition.\nIn other words, all that is happening right now that is actually opening the   eyes of the people to worship God, it's something new but the church that had   that concept long ago, it's there. It's our congregation. Right now, it's what   the people have realised that it's what they were supposed to do, because Shembe   was telling the truth that people are supposed to worship God in their own way.   Our congregation is boasting, because when Shembe came he taught the people   to respectit is not very easy to see a congregation who is so respecting,   like our congregation, irrespective of whether they are men, women, girls or   boys. It was one of Shembe's teachings, therefore we are proud to say that Shembe   taught us not to drink liquor, we must not smoke cigarettes, we must not use   medicine. I remember when I was still very young, when the boys were smoking,   they thought that I was stupid because I was not doing what they were doing,   I was not drinking. But right now, Shembe's teachings against smoking, it's   only now that the people have realised that it's a problem it's very difficult   for them to stop smoking and drinking. Shembe realised long ago that it's very   wrong to drink liquor, but it's only now that people have realised that it is   wrong. We don't have a problem with alcohol. We don't have people who are smoking,   e don't have people who are addicted to drugs, but it is what you will find   among our congregation.

A person who normally visits your church at the end will   have a question of what happened to the other people. I don't know how can we   spread this spirit of your congregation in our community, in our society, more   especially the black community? There is something that I would like to ask.   This leadership of yours, it looks like it is something that is associated with   the kingdom, the culture of the kingdom. Because I can see from Isiah, Galile   and their children that there's a time whereby God would come out and point   out the leader who is not coming from that family. I wish to say that the leadership   of Ekuphakameni has got nothing to do with the royals. I think it's actually   following the guidelines from the bible. What is more important here is thatbefore   that I want to say that a person who is a leader in the royal family is a person   who is a prince. In Ekuphakameni, there has never been any person like that   who would become a leader. Galile was not a prince, it's only ...[inaudible]   who was a prince. When Galile died, it's only his brother who became a leader.   After his brother , it was their son. If I'm saying it's following the guidelines   from the bible it means, even from Israel, Jacob was appointed and after that   it happened like that. All their children became the priest. If God has chosen   that anyone who is a brother or son to that family becomes a leader, that doesn't   necessarily mean that it's the first thing that happened in Ekuphakameni. It's   not our culture or tradition that's been used there as a procedure. I think   that it's something that came from heaven.",

            "Chairperson, we appreciate as the Blydende Kring, to have this   opportunity to make this submission, even so late and we are not in uniform.   We appreciate the possibility and opportunity afforded us to make the submission.   We are going to try to on the one hand, speak to our submission by highlighting   some areas which we feel need to be highlighted, maybe others we will not be   able to elaborately go into as a result of the fact that you have a our faxed   submission before you. \nThe Belydende Kring was formerly called the Broeder Kring and established in   1974 in Bloemfontein in Mangaung. An organisation that worked primarily and   exclusively targeting the Dutch Reformed Church family which was consisting   of the four racially divided churches the NG Kerk which was formerly for whites   only; the NG Sending Kerk, which was established for coloureds only; the NG   Kerk in Afrika, which was for Indians; and the Reformed Church in Afrika, which   was for Indians. An organisation ...[inaudible] from within all the racially   divided churches who had experienced that these churches were based on a biblical,   astrological justification of apartheid as the will of God for South Africa,   propounded by the NG Kerk which was called the Moeder Kerk and others were called   the daughter churches. These individuals were critical of that system. They   spoke out - remember the days of Dr Alan Boesak who was also a member and some   point the chairperson of our organisation, and many others who spoke out very   clearly opposing that system, outside the churches, but also inside the churches,   went to meetings with the NG Kerk and all our churches, spoke to the grassroots   in the churches, had meetings with women's organisations to try to indicate   that this situation which we found ourselves in wherein we were experiencing   also suspicion from our communities by being called the church of Amabulu. There   is still that kind of hostile attitude and we had to indicate that we are not   the church of Amabulu, secondly that the white church, NG Church is not speaking   for us.\nThat is why we build our church buildings, our resources in both our skills   and also our buildings to make sure that we rebut apartheid theology, as was   manifest in the mission theology that led to the establishment of all these   churches. The experience of most of our members was also that the black churches,   other churches, were also held hostage psychologically and financially by the   \"Moeder Kerk\" so that for those critical in both the white church   and the other churches, the experience of being left vulnerable and exposed   to the activity of security force officials, some of whom came from ranks of   elders in the NG Kerk. Some of the experiences made by members of the BK because   of this kind of stance included among other things, as we have said, being ostracised   by both the church and the people. In the NG Kerk, you were called a traitor   because you were betraying the Volk. People like Beyers Naude. Remember a person   like Reverend Conradie who died under mysterious circumstances and we hope the   commission will help us unravel the way that he passed away. But he was seen   increasingly, also by his family, as somebody betraying the Afrikaner Volk by   having been a member of a black church or organisation. \nAnd those in the these churches were seen as bringing suffering by being a   member, that's most critical, against apartheid. In this situation, Chairperson,   the BK provided a haven where people who were suffering because of their stand,   found a home. And we built a very wonderful community of people across the divide   of racial lines who began trusting each other, supporting each other both financially   and in a human way. We went to families and we've got families and people with   whom we are in communion because we believe that the unity struggle which we   waged should also ...[inaudible] and the pains of becoming one should such be   experienced by us if we have to preach it out and live it out. \nTherefore we faced ostracism from the official churches, both daughter and   mother church. Some of our members experienced society cutbacks from such ministers   and this led to the division of congregations and division of parishes to exert   pressure and create a climate where such ministers would be ousted out by the   congregation for being either political, highly suspect or undesirable in both   the church and society. Our churches were planted with informers when we were   preaching to make sure that such ministers or lay-members who were preaching   also in our churches, would be highly suspect and being not accepted within   the congregations. Yes some of us faced harassment, physical and psychological   torture, intimidation, imprisonment of such people who were critical of the   system in the churches. And the sad thing was that the society had believed   in the membership of our churches. Critical thinking was dangerous and that   to be Christian means to be submissive and obedient and quiet. A sad fact is   that we have also division, which meant that some ministers were also allowed   to participate for instance in the public media. Some NG Kerk and Afrikaans   ministers were allowed to preach on the radio. Others were not allowed because   we were critical and there were structures in church to make sure that this   doesn't happen. And there were many of our brothers and sisters who were in   these structures and this division with a lot of suspicion and lack of acceptance,   to make sure that this theology propounded by the NG Kerk be maintained also   in the church and also by our church. Radio sermons and programmes on anti-communism   were propounded from these groups, also within our church and those people who   were not saying this were left out and branded as being communist and therefore   to be fought against and be highly suspected. The integrity and credibility   of critical persons, as I say, was highly suspect, seen to be dangerous, as   communist. Especially by some missionary elements who belonged to the Broederbond. \nChairperson, we need to pause here to plead with the commission, because this   strange marriage between the Broederbond and the NG Kerk needs to be also opened   up. I am saying this because in one of the meetings in Bloemfontein in 1993,   the late Professor Heyns mentioned in the meeting that had it not been for the   Broederbond, the question of the new dispensation, the question of the liberation   of our struggle would not have seen the kind of dimensions which are happening.   Therefore we plead that the full truth about what happened, and why, would be   disclosed. The commission to look into the questions of finding the way of the   Broederbond and its members in this time. Opening it up and telling us what   happened.\nAs far as missionaries and mission theology was concerned, in the experience   of many in our constituencies, these missionaries represented the NG Kerk theology   launching pads and strongholds, both within the life and work of church and   theological training of our churches. We need to say this, Chairperson, because   many mission stations were used as operation points for the military, for planning,   for meetings of the generals of the SADF. We have many stories about this that   can be told, Chairperson, and it would be very interesting if we can find a   way of opening up this point and have it be known by our community in South   Africa. The mission theology also represented economic impoverishment of the   black churches, because whilst much funding was given in the names of missions,   it only ended up in the pockets of the missionaries. Some even had inconvenience   allowances for serving in the black institutions. This also was one of the things   which we as members of the BK experienced from our own churches. Because whilst   our churches made very relevant and critical decisions, it was also being held   hostage by the theological and financial grip of the NG Kerk. Many of them would   not implement those decisions. We have heard here about how churches pride themselves   in terms of making good decisions, but not turned them out complementing them.   We took it upon ourselves as members of the churches and organisations to try   out and implement some of these decisions and therefore our goals include, among   other things Chairperson, to organise for an organic church unity starting from   the grassroots in congregations up to the whole structure of a church to that   level. To embark on a priestly ministry to the victims of apartheid. Many of   our people who were victims in this whole structure - we had to have prayer   meetings, visit them, support their families, during this time to make sure   that they don't feel left alone and vulnerable to the activities of the police,   as in many cases it happened. To pledge solidarity with all organisations who   share the same visions and goal with us. That's why we became members of so   many organisations. The SACC, the SAT, Abreksa, Christian Institution - precisely   because of our commitment of the fact that we felt by doing that we would be   able to give form and programmes and participation in solidarity to our goals.\nWe also had some problems, specifically to address this situation, Chairperson.   We had a fund which we called the ...[inaudible] Support Fund, out of which   we helped families and ministers who salaries were cut by the NG Kerk because   of their stance. Our issue was not simply just to help them, but to support   the kind of witness we stood for as ministers, as lay people in these congregations.   This fund was transferred to the new United Church, before we became one. As   one of the programmes that was needed to assist the church that in its unification,   they must be able to address the question of poverty and the poor congregations   and try to break the dependant umbilical cord on the white NG Kerk. We also   had a programme to empower women, which is called the BK Women's Programme,   through which the question of gender was discussed and in any way, that's how   we changed the name from Broeder Kring to Belydende Kring, because in 1983 in   Free Town in Johannesburg, the women constituents of our membership challenged   us so critically about the sensitivity about women's issues to a point when   we even felt that even the name that we carry, we could not continue to be Broeders.   But we were also being confused with the Broederbond, and that was used against   us as being people who are not honest in terms of secrecy, having secret meetings   and so on. So we had to change our name from being Broeder Kring to Belydende   Kring. We also had a scholarship and bursary programme. On this one, Chairperson,   I would say that our experience has been that as a black church and other churches,   with all the amount of money that was used for our training, for the past -   since 1908 - until 1980 or 1988, we never saw any production of meaningful leadership   in our churches, through the assistance of the white churches. But when we started   this whole scholarship programme, we were able to produce more than 20 people   with PHD's who have leadership and skills for our churches. Unfortunately some   of them were not accepted by our churches, because they were regarded as having   been trained abroad in America and imbibed the spirit of freedom and liberation   theology. But this ...[inaudible] to our church and churches and our community   and most of these people are holding very important and senior positions in   the life of our church and also our society.\nWe wish to point out, Chairperson, that we are very disappointed that the situation   of the NG Kerk as a submission of this statement, according to us has not changed   much. In the publication of the document \"Op reis met Apartheid\" does   not move the NG Kerk towards the kind of confession that would facilitate church   unity with forgiveness and reconciliation and enable to facilitate it. We are   saying this, specifically Chairperson, because presently in the Free State and   Northern Cape there is a lot of dissent, a lot of struggle between the former   NG Kerk and ...[inaudible]. And this struggle to accept unity is traceable to   some professors, some ministers and some farmers in the Free State of the NG   Kerk who are ...[indistinct] this initiative of unification. Victimisation of   congregations continues and ministers and general chaos and destruction of congregational   property still continues in this whole struggle and therefore in a certain sense,   we as an organisation are still not yet over this question of being one. We   are still ...[inaudible] the struggle. Where apartheid still rides in our church   and our people are every Sunday, we work closely with ...[inaudible] of our   church to make sure that the input and the resources that are available outside   of the churches were made available also to our churches.\nIn conclusion Chairperson, whilst we appreciate the opportunity afforded us   by the TRC to make this submission, we wish to point out the following\nThe continual denial of the NG Kerk to officially make a submission to the   TRC holds hostage many Afrikaner civilians trapped in apartheid. So the point   that we want to make is the official denial of the NG Kerk to officially make   a submission to the TRC holds many Afrikaners hostage and the TRC as a form   of confession as is pregnant with controversy. Whilst also the TRC is a judicial   Commission, we wish to put on record that as far as NG Kerk is concerned, it   is not primarily the physical implementation of the apartheid that constituted   a gross violation of human rights, but the belief system, the theology, the   religion that created the conditions where many perpetrators could operate with   innocence, with joy, needs to be castigated. Even where no physical injury or   torture could be measured or claimed to have occurred. We wish to point out   also that reconciliation in our understanding and belief is costly, because   it requires justice to be done and be seen to be done. Confessions of truth   done with no sense of guilt, feeling, remorse and apology, with intent not to   repeat these wounds, sounds very hollow and does not seem healing to both perpetrator   and victim. Indeed we look forward to the day when our ...[inaudible] will indeed   be seen to be seeking for justice and justice alone to be done.\nIn this light therefore we wish to recommend to the TRC that most of our members   have suffered humiliation and - when they visited funerals and weddings of people   who dying or dead in the NG Kerk and they were left out, they were cast out   to sit at the back seat. We think that the NG Kerk owes an apology for this   kind of treatment even to our members and also members of our communities in   the Black Dutch Reformed Church. The TRCNG Kerk confesses to having created   a climate and conditions that made it possible for people to do the heinous   deeds they did without any due regard for a life of the victims they victimised.   And in conclusion Chairperson, that the TRC recommends that the present process   of Land Reform and Restitution and Reparation, those are critically focused   on the NG Kerk with possible intentions of symbolically compensating many families   of ministers and lay people who have been victimised in terms of salaries and   pensions as a result of NG Kerk actions as policies as we have mentioned about. \nWe deem it would be in the interest of the TRC process so the nation can hear   some of the stories that need to be heard at some stage, if it is possible,   but these stories abound of people who refused to be at the mercy of the NG   Kerk for all during this time.\nGod Bless Africa, guide our leaders, guard our children and give us peace with   justice.

However, we   are thankful about the fact that the United Reformed Church opened up the possibility   at its Synod meeting in Bloemfontein this year, when they asked for the possibility   of there being a TRC process in the relationships between the white church and   the United Reform Church. But in that context, maybe we can meaningfully start   facing each other and confronting this experience which we are going together.   I am therefore not pessimistic that the possibility exists. I would, however,   also caution to say that the experience which is happening in the Free State   now and the Northern Cape, continues to bedevil this hope, because many of our   membership are saying, \"You can't trust these people. On the one hand they   tell you that if you are critical, even under the new dispensation, we will   withdraw your salaries, they still cut back your salaries.\" How can you   - speaking of reconciliation experience this kind of situation? On the other   - most of the problems we had to support this kind of witness which is very   vital for reconciliation, has been ...[inaudible] of our churches. We are not   seeing very much being done about this. They are in the hands, on the tables   or in the files of our church, but we are not seeing them being actualised and   implemented and therefore it is only when our churches, especially the United   Reformed Church, in our view because of our members have also agreed that they   are going to now serve fully in the commissions and the lives of this newly   born church, are hopeful that within this kind of situation we can make the   kind of input which will create conditions where we can meaningfully enter into   the kind of discussions which will make it possible that some ways can be found   about creating bridges and reconciliation within the churches.\nThe sad thing, Chairperson, I must mention is that also we may succeed in our   own experience because most of our churches were pockets within the larger problem   of apartheid churches, but if you don't find churches in the coalition in the   white church, who are willing to pay the price, who are willing to say we are   not just critical in giving lip service to being critical, but we are willing   to pay the price and sacrifice of what negotiation entails. That creates the   possibility of having bridges in those contexts where we can meaningfully build   bridges between us and themselves.",

            "Thank you very much. Chairperson of the commission, members   of the commission, ladies and gentlemen, good morning, goeie more, shalom, molweni. \nOn behalf of the Muslim Judicial Council, I wish to express our appreciation   for this opportunity in the spirit of hope to make a contribution to the truth   of the past and peace and reconciliation for the future. I also wish to congratulate   and thank the TRC under the leadership of Bishop Desmond Tutu for undertaking   the noble task of probing the conscience of the nation in order to put our heartforth   freedom on a sound spiritual footing where our different political parties,   structures of government, business, the press, our different traditions and   civil societies of all might rediscover the fullness of humanity together in   a single nation.\nChairperson, history has planted Islam and Muslims in the Cape in South Africa   more than 300 years ago. Under conditions that were not unfamiliar to the majority   of people in our country. Muslims were brought to South Africa either as captured   freedom fighters against Dutch colonialism in the far East, as slaves to European   masters or as indentured labourers. The socio-political relations of domination   at the time ensured that Islam remained a subjugated religion of a minority,   enjoying neither equality nor the right to free expression. As slaves and political   exiles, besides the right to worship freely, they were denied the erection of   places of worship and burial ground. This is probably one of the reasons why   the graves of the notables are spread far and wide into the then \"bundus\"   of the Cape Peninsula, including the well known Robben Island. It was only in   1804 that the Betravian Republic granted the Muslims two specific privileges   apparently in anticipation of their loyalty against the invading British. The   first burial grounds, the Kanabaru in the BoKaap was one. The second was a promise   of a site to build a Mosque. Chairperson and Commissioners, a Mosque is the   life of a Muslim community, is a vital institution. It is there at the centre   of social interaction and not only a place of formal worship. A Mosque in the   Islamic sense is a sense of learning and instruction, not merely in religious   norms, but also of the functioning of the individual in his or her social milieu.   In essence, it becomes the semanating of communal and social life and as such,   an important institution in the development of the community's culture. \nIt was under these circumstances and its effect that the Muslim Judicial Council   was formed in 1945, primarily in the interest of Muslim unity. But also, to   voice a protest against oppressive laws and governmental policy. Dr Cherrister   of UCT, in his book \"Religions of South Africa\" states according to   the original statement of purpose, the MJC was founded in the interest of all   non-Europeans, who should at all times irrespective of race or creed, join forces   against the oppressive forces which are endeavouring to retard their progress   in all spheres in this country. \nIn 1961, the Muslim Judicial Council, in conjunction with the Muslim Youth   Movement, Cape Town, Claremont Youth Association, Cape Vigilant's Association,   Young Men's Muslim Association and a number of Muslim Religious leaders and   individuals launched the Call of Islam declaration and I quote \"For too   long a time now have we been together with our fellow sufferers subjugated,   suffered humiliation of being regarded as being inferior beings, deprived of   our basic right to earn, to learn and to worship according to the divine rule   of God. We can no longer tolerate further encroachment on these, our basic rights   and therefore we stand firm with our brothers in fighting the evil monster that   is about to devour us, that is oppression, tyranny and baska.\" The declaration   continues to express opposition and resistance to the Group Areas Act, pass   laws, job reservations and substantiates this position with the relevant scriptural   support from the holy Koran. The Call of Islam Declaration was followed by a   packed meeting at the City Hall, Cape Town on the 7th May 1961. It was at this   meeting that the Muslim Judicial Council declared apartheid in any form could   not be condoned by Islam. On the basis of this, Achmad Davids, a Muslim historian   and writer, stated in an article to the Centre of African Studies on studies   in the history of Cape Town, that the Muslim Judicial Council was the first   religious organisation in South Africa to declare apartheid a hierarchy.\nIt is within this context, Chairperson, appropriate to mention that during   the 1984 Tri-camaral Parliament election campaign, that the \"don't vote\"   charge of the MJC developed into the popularised declaration made by Muslim   speakers at meetings held under the auspices of the UDF to vote for apartheid   is \"haram\". Dr Gerrie Lubbe in his dissertation on the history of   the Muslim Judicial Council states that by bringing these political terms and   issues into the category of the forbidden which is the meaning of \"haram\",   overwhelming acceptance was achieved through the use of a very concrete language   known to every Muslim. To name a political system as unsuitable for human consumption   was certainly most unique, but very effective. Chairperson, I have mentioned   the meaning of a Mosque in the Islamic faith. It was the Group Areas Act which   hurt and angered Muslims most in the 1960's. Muslim youths in 1964 reported   that the powerful religious body, the Muslim Judicial Council convened a national   conference to protest the Group Areas Act, a threat to their Mosques. Amongst   the nine resolutions adopted at the conference were the following That Muslims   throughout the Republic should never abandon their Mosques. Where Muslims were   resettled and new Mosques were built, the Mosques were ...[inaudible] the congregational   prayer was previously performed, to continue with it and other daily prayers.   Muslims should, under no circumstances, apply to the government for a permit   to perform prayers in Mosques that have been left in proclaimed white areas.   Muslims should under no circumstances compromise on these religious principles.   From these resolutions, it can clearly be seen that the Muslim community viewed   the Group Areas Act as an attack on its religious freedom. It was felt that   the respect and sacredness of the Mosque were violated when the people who had   to use it were forcibly removed from it. \nDuring the late sixties, the growing political awareness amongst the Cape Muslims   intensified with the death of the well known and popular Imam Abdullah Harum.   He was detained for almost four months under the infamous \"Terrorism Act\".   His death sparked off wide criticism both inside and outside South Africa. Imam   Abdullah Harum was the Imam at one of the Mosques affected by the Group Areas   Act, the Mosque in Claremont, Cape Town. He was the chairperson of the MJC at   the time of his death and his death brought about unfortunately a polarisation   between the conservative and progressive members in the organisation of the   Muslim Judicial Council.\nIn the seventies the MJC issued a very strong letter against the apartheid   regime, protesting against the killing of our children and the brutality of   the security forces during the riots of 1976. This protest letter received wide   coverage and considerable backlash from the authorities, so much so, that the   secretary of the Muslim's Council Office were raided by the Security forces.   When the UDF was formed in 1983, in order to spearhead the opposition to the   Tri-cameral Parliament constitutional proposals, the MJC decided to affiliate   to the movement on the basis that the Muslim community is part and parcel of   the oppressed and has a common struggle with the oppressed. \n\"The MJC believes that it cannot divorce itself from the rest of the oppressed   and those with the same ideals in the formation of a united democratic front,   to oppose a system of apartheid in South Africa\" - Muslim News, 1983.\nA protest march aimed at the release of President Nelson Mandela, then jailed   ANC leader in August 1985 was banned in terms of a Magisterial Order. The march   continued despite the ban, to Pollsmoor Prison. Violent clashes broke out between   protesters and police and several religious leaders of various faiths were detained.   One of the detainees was the Chairperson of the Muslim Judicial Council. The   MJC then issued a strong statement on the unjust detention of its Chairperson   and all other religious leaders. The statement further condemned the cruel,   brutal and inhuman actions of the armed forces as well as their presence in   the black townships and declared that the policy of apartheid, segregation and   oppression was un-Islamic, abnormal and contrary to the laws of Allah. \nIn the mid eighties the MJC called a mass meeting at the ...[inaudible] Salaam   Complex in Athlone in protest against the Trojan Horse incident. Over 7 000   people attended and subsequently the Mosque was placed under siege by the Security   Forces and one person was murdered, or killed, by the Security Forces and several   injured in the ensuing clashes. President Nelson Mandela, whilst in prison in   Pollsmoor in March 1985 wrote a letter to the MJC in which he concludes with   the following \"I want to point out that there are two evils which have   confronted society right down the centuries.\" He then continues to elaborate   on these evils and says about the Muslim Judicial Council \"In my mind   the current situation in which I cannot express myself fully and fairly, except   to let you know that I consider the Muslim Judicial Council to be fully committed   to the elimination of these evils. This is the reason why the MJC is an inspiration   to us all, Yours sincerely, signed N.R. Mandela\".\nIn conclusion, Chairperson, I am not here to praise the Muslim Judicial Council.   Its documented records speak for themselves. However, conservatism which is   almost natural to religious organisations took its toll also on the MJC and   certain ambiguous tendencies were experienced within the MJC with some fundamental   issues in the historic struggle for freedom in South Africa. The MJC could and   should have done more. We regret this, we sincerely apologise for this shortcoming.   Conservatism in other quarters of the Olamah Groupings in other parts of the   country tended towards reactionary. They obstinately refused to be moved from   their record of silence on any political issue which would appear to be anti-State   and consequently did not join the overwhelming consensus of Muslim organisations   in declaring participation in the apartheid Tri-cameral Parliament elections   against the spirit of Islam. This can be construed as complicity in the apartheid   crime against humanity. Pressure by radical youth groups and a wide range of   organisations succeeded, however, in getting the Natal Olamah to issue a statement   on the eve of the Indian elections, in that it is unacceptable because they   perpetuate racism and segregation. The Transvaal Ulamah, however, were consistent   in their silence. We do take collective responsibility for this unfortunate   omission and apologise to those whose aid and assistance we have failed to respond   in time of great need.\nFinally, Chairperson, in spite of the all the inherent weakness of the TRC,   we believe that it does contribute towards the process of dealing with our past,   and more importantly, laying the foundation for new morality based on a culture   of human rights. The success of the TRC, however, is directly linked and dependent   on its ability to reveal and uncover the truth. In this, the Muslim Judicial   Council is prepared to co-operate and I hope and pray that they perform that   function. \nI wish to end by quoting two verses from the Holy Koran, which are relevant   to the Truth Commission Koran, Chapter 2, Verse 42, \"And do not cover   the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth when you know what it is.\"   Secondly, Koran, Chapter 17, Verse 81, \"And say truth has arrived and falsehood   has perished for indeed falsehood is by its nature perishing\".\nChairperson, Commissioners, on behalf of the Muslim Judicial Council, and the   Muslim Community, particularly in the Cape, I thank you for this opportunity.",

            "Chairperson, Archbishop Tutu, members of the Truth and Reconciliation   Commission, brothers and sisters we greet you in the name of peace. The name   of our Lord Jesus Christ. We firstly apologise for any inconvenience caused   to this very commission for our failure to have entered into this submission   yesterday because of some certain technical problems, particularly the flights   that really delayed our appearing before this honourable commission. We thank   the commission for inviting our church to publicly share our experience and   suffering during the dark years of apartheid. \nOur contribution in the spiritual war against hatred amongst fellow South Africans   and our ambition for the future of our country\nChairperson, the Zion Christian Church was born after the Anglo-Boer War just   before Union in 1910. The founder of the church, Bishop Agnus Barnarbas Lekganyane   had by then become acutely aware of the attempt by missionaries to erode African   value systems and cultural beliefs. He realised that unless Christianity was   interpreted in a context suitable to the African lifestyle, cultural and political   development, Africans would, in due course find themselves as a nation alienated   from its roots, rich history and religious foundation. Without the infrastructure   available to so-called \"main stream\" churches at the time, Bishop   Agnus worked tirelessly for the spiritual upliftment of his people and by 1948,when   he passed away, let me pause to say May his soul rest in peace, the Zion Christian   Church was approximately 120 000 people strong. \nIn spite of the propaganda war which was waged against him and his followers,   fellow Africans in the mainstream churches in those days derided him and expressed   sentiments like ...[inaudible]. Agnus was less concerned about comments from   his critics. In 1924 when one of his followers asked him what colour he thought   God was Agnus retorted and said, and I quote, \"We are made in the image   of God and if this is true, then I assure you friends that when we enter the   kingdom of heaven, you will find a God of your colour\". When his critics   read this they immediately spread a rumour to the ethic that Lekganyane claimed   that he is God. The reason for this was simply that people at that stage clearly   believed that God was white and nothing else. Mention must be made of the fact   that Lekganyane missionary work started in the rural areas of the present day   Northern Province. He showed great respect for African chieftancy. And because   of this, many chiefs allowed him to preach the gospel of Christ in their areas.   So great was his respect for African chieftancy that when he established the   church, one of the very first buildings he built was a guest house for chiefs,   who called from time to time to join him in prayer, for rain and good harvest. \nWhen the ANC adopted its first constitution in 1919, and established the upper   house of chiefs, Agnus was among the first people to applaud, because in his   view and I quote \"When our educated young leaders recognised our historical   background the African was on a path to somewhere\".\nIn 1927, when the status of African chieftancy was downgraded by the Native   Administration Act, Agnus refused to recognise that African chieftancy was subject   to the whims and life of the white government. To him, the African chieftancy   was an institution not to be tampered with, least of all by a foreign people   who understand very little or nothing about African culture. From the beginning,   our church viewed habits such as drinking liquor, smoking tobacco or dagga and   violence as against the gospel of Christ. As such, tobacco, dagga, now lately   including narcotic drugs, liquor and all forms of violence were and are still   prohibited in the Zion Christian Church. Agnus proclaimed peace to all people   on earth. So dedicated to peace was he that he even taught his followers to   precede their greetings by proclaiming peace to each other. From 1910 to date,   when we greet each other, we first proclaim \"Peace\" and then proceed   with our greetings. Similarly, our sermons are punctuated by proclaiming peace   on earth, a doctrine for which we are now so popular.\nBy 1948, the church had spread to virtually all corners of South Africa and   it was growing even faster in the urban areas. At the same time, apartheid was   tightening its grip around the neck of the Africans. At that time, Bishop Edward   Lekganyane was the spiritual head of the church. Young people asked him if they   were free to join African political movements, agitating for the betterment   of their lot. Edward advised them that as long as their extra-church activities   were not in conflict with the practices of the church, they were free to participate.   Most members of the church then felt free to participate in the broader community   resistance programmes against apartheid. In 1959, Bishop Edward built a primary   school in Morea. The school was opened to members of the community, of the area   at large. Already at the time, Lekganyane was urging for the economic independence   of African people. He requested the church council to establish a mill which   at the time employed 150 people. Subsistence farmers from nearby villages sold   their harvest at the mill, which continued to grow to this day. The present   staff complement at the mill is 180 people who would otherwise have been unemployed.\nIn 1969 the church realised the acute lack of transport in Pietersburg and   its outlying rural areas, for African people. A bus company was established   to serve the area. Until 1985 the company received no subsidy from the government   and was running at a loss, hopelessly. The church, however, felt that the needs   of the community were above profit and continued to run the company out of its   coffers. Education is seen as a high priority in our church. Immediately after   the University of the North was established, the church resolved to establish   the Khotso Bursary Fund, which assisted children from all backgrounds in their   quest to achieve higher education. Due to its own growth and demand for higher   education by its youth, the church established a new Bursary Fund in 1985, known   as the Bishop Edward Lekganyane Bursary Fund. The present annual budget thereof   is R2 million. The fund is unique in that it considers the disadvantaged background   from whence we come. For instance we recognise that due to our past history,   most black children find adjustment in the traditional white tertiary institutions   sometimes uncomfortable. When such a child fails to achieve desired results,   the church does not withdraw the bursary but rather encourages the child to   achieve better results with the funds support. \nAn adult literacy programme in 1988 and basic skills such as bricklaying and   baking were started in 1996 and from our observations are doing well. The annual   budget for both is R1,5 million. In 1974 the church established Marabathuta   High School with boarding facilities. The church then invited the government   to run the school for the benefit of all children from surrounding areas. The   church presently subsidises the school to the tune of R150 000.00 annually and   the amount is expected to grow in the coming years. Recently, we built a clinic   in ...[inaudible] which caters for 400 out patients, representative of the entire   community, not only Zionist. The facility cost the church R2,5 million. The   clinic is intended to serve all the people in ...[inaudible], Mamabulo and Molepo   areas. According to the Department of Health Dynamics, the clinic is already   operational. A post office which serves the general public was also built by   the church at a cost of approximately R250 000.00. Telkom was invited to upgrade   the telephone exchange capacity of the post office and the result thereof is   that all the nearby rural areas have access to telephones, either in their homes   or public.\nWe place on record that we were and are opposed to disinvestment as a means   to an end. During the time when companies were disinvesting, the church encouraged   its members to enter the business arena to create jobs. We established a forum   to assist each group of business people to create jobs. The reason for doing   so was that these people were the first to feel the brunt of investor's withdrawal   of capital from the Republic of South Africa.\nChairperson, the aforementioned are some of the projects the Zion Christian   Church established. Insofar as our vision for the future of our country is concerned,   we urge our business community and the government to assist in the rapid creation   of jobs. The high crime rate which is presently ravaging our country is partly   due to the lack of employment. Our church, like other institutions, encourages   our youth to value education as a key to a brighter tomorrow. We are, however,   disappointed to notice regrettably that some of our young graduates are walking   the streets with degrees, without any prospect of employment in sight. Chairperson,   this problem needs to be addressed as a matter of national priority. If we continue   to produce graduates who find difficulty in entering the job market, it will   soon become difficult to urge children to go to school. \nCrime is yet another problem which requires our attention. So serious is this   that we feel that the police, the army, and the community at large much join   forces to reclaim our freedom from criminals. Unless the three aforesaid forces   join hands in fighting crime, Mr Chairperson, I am afraid our future is bleak.   We also call upon the justice and correctional service departments to play their   role in the war against crime. There is no point in arresting criminals only   to let them loose due to lack of proper attention paid to cases by the Justice   Department. We also unashamedly call on the government to reinstate the death   sentence. On the other hand we discourage our democracy from legalising immorality   such as prostitution and gangsterism. \nIn summation, South Africans - black, white, yellow or any colour - need one   another to fight against all evils and most significantly to bring about the   betterment of all people across the board. As long as love, peace, acceptance,   forgiveness and true reconciliation remain pillars of strength for all Christians,   then with God's help everything will be possible. \nIn conclusion, Chairperson, and honourable members of the commission, I am   tempted to quote wise words from the holy book which read as follows\n\"How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity. It   is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running   down upon the collar of his robes. It is as if the dew of heaven were falling   on mount Zion, for there the Lord restores his blessing, giving life forever   more\". This is from Psalm 133.\nMay God Bless our country, may God Bless our leaders and its people. Thank   you.",

It   was during a time when there was a lot of disinformation that was doing the   rounds in our community. We got stories to the effect that Lekganyane formed   a defence force. Newspapers spread rumours of that nature, and we did not ask   - we had headlines like \"ZCC Defence Force\". Not true. This was quoted   in the Times. Some newspapers that does the rounds in Pietersburg started these   rumours and in the charged circumstances in those days, young activists without   checking facts, started massing up and believing that the church was their enemy.   Thanks to the wisdom that prevailed in those days, I recall that Seth Ntayi,   who is now in the Northern Province Legislative Assembly, played a very significant   role in joining us in reducing the tension in that area. The church never had   any problem with any political organisation at all and even when we were criticised   by political organisations, by any other person, the church did not respond   in a way that was unchristian. In most cases, this church simply keeps quiet,   when there is no need to respond, because we believe from the teachings of Ingenasi,   that when you start arguing with fools, sooner or later nobody realises who   is not a fool.",

            "Thanks Mam. It is true that when the missionaries came to   this country, their agenda was slightly more than just converting us and being   good Christians. In fact, Lord Renwick recently said in all those years when   he met Bishop Tutu, Bishop Tutu used to say to him, you know when the missionaries   came here, we welcomed them. They gave us bibles. In no time we realised that   we had more bibles, and they had more land. This is the situation from which   this church was born and we recognised that our values were going down the drain   and we started building up a religion that was Afro-centric and not Eurocentric   and even today, I doubt if there is any church in this country that has the   number of youth that this church has. Our latest statistics show that 60% of   our membership are people under the age of 24 and I can tell you that without   boasting, we do have our problems, we do have aberrations, children who will   go out of their way and not respect parents, but this church is a bigger family.   A child belongs to the wider community and not to two people. When a child gets   out of step and the parents don't take care of that child, in reprimanding him   or in creating a spiritual guided way to lead the child forward, the church   steps in and we contribute substantially. I think if Nkosazana Zuma was here   she would clap her hands. We contribute substantially in making the young people   to refrain from using habit forming drugs, including cigarettes. We consider   that as a habit forming drug. Including liquor. We feel that these are the things   that are decaying the moral values of our children. We are building on that   our leadership ...[indistinct] right now, that's from young women in the age   of 17 up to the age of 100, we've got a streak of leadership that starts from   that level, right up to the highest age, because we are a church that basically   relies on the passing of traditional African values by way of mouth, because   we don't have books. There are a few books written by Mbithi, and the Ethiopians,   but essentially they do not deal so much about African culture per say. We take   it from the grey heads you see in this hall today. They tell us which way to   go, most of the time. We blend that with the teaching of Christ. We blend that   with the modern outlook that we have today, and for as long as it does not interfere   in the moral fabric of our people we are happy to accept any suggestions.",

Without   even going deep into the word of scripture, the constitution itself, the Constitutional   Court which is the supreme interpreter of our law, has outlawed it. The reality   here, Mr Chairperson, the church feels that he who lives by the sword shall   perish by the sword. The church feels that he who disregards human values and   rights of other people can hardly claim that reserve as his own for purposes   of elongating his existence on earth. \nThe church feels that strange as it sounds, the death sentence is a necessary   evil. However, in its way of doing things, the church has never climbed on any   political platform and said reinstate the death sentence. No, no, no the church   doesn't do that. The church has communicated its concern to our political leaders   and all people who have visited or invited us to one discussion or another.   We appreciate the death sentence was a tool that was abused mercilessly in the   past. And as a result, many African people have got sad memories about the death   sentence. In fact when you say death sentence to any African you bring very,   very terrible memories. But if we have to build and protect our democracy, there   is now way, Mr Chairperson, we can continue to witness women raped, children   abused, people killed with almost amazing insolence, with no feelings of warmth   at all. We cannot, Mr Chairperson, and members of the commission, allow the   situation that exists in this country right now. You have people who just simply   kill people for the fun of killing people.

They shot him once, they didn't assault   him. Now if you look at the type of attitude we have in this country today,   maybe we can look at scrapping the death sentence ten years down the line.

But as a church the ZCC taught its people   to love themselves more than ever, to stand upright and face the future, to   defy the laws of apartheid. And that all these teachings are not known in the   press, in the general public at large can hardly be the problem of the Zion   Christian Church. The ZCC taught its people continuously to follow the path   of justice, to fight against injustice. Many of our members died in the struggle.   We are not going to stand on this platform now and start name dropping because   it was a painful experience in our lives.

            "I would like to first take this opportunity, Mr Chairman, to thank   this commission for inviting us the Evangelical Alliance to make a submission.   We feel it is correct the Evangelical community alongside other South Africans   of faith and those of no faith should give an account of their faith and conduct   in the last few decades. \nAs representative of the Evangelical movement, we stand before the commission   and a nation in search of truth and reconciliation. With heads bowed in shame   for the way in which our movement failed God and South Africans by not standing   sufficiently with the poor and oppressed in the years of apartheid. This went   against the biblical witness which we are committed to uphold. We are mindful   of the fact that many South Africans might well be tempted to reject God on   account of the way we represented him, instead of preaching good news to the   poor, we found it easier to conform to the ways of the wealthy and powerful.   Instead of rejecting racism, we not only institutionalised it in our own churches,   but we proclaimed the gospel as though the sin of racism and violation of human   rights did not matter to the God we serve. \nTo often some among us embraced too readily and uncritically the patronage   of an unjust government simply because that government presented itself as Christian.   This severely compromised the gospel we are called to proclaim. We therefore   take this opportunity to express our hope that South Africans will forgive the   churches. We have made it that much harder for them to find their God. Having   said that, it needs to be said Mr Chairman that the Evangelical community as   with other church groupings, had within its ranks at least two traditions. There   was a tradition that was prophetic or progressive, as well as a tradition that   was conservative. The former sought in word and deed to bring together Evangelism   and social concern, personal salvation and social transformation. Indeed, this   tradition has helped to produce a lot of good leadership in our society. This   tradition might we add, was not part of the hierarchy of the church for the   most part, but pastors and lay persons who were largely marginalised by the   hierarchy and largely black. Their leadership was neither recognised nor embraced   by the dominantly white leadership of the Evangelical movement.\nOn the other hand the conservative tradition within our movement tended to   see faith largely in other worldly terms with regard to society, this tradition   found it easy to move from theological conservatism to political conservatism.   The tragic result of this is that the defence of human rights was seen to be   outside the scope and mission of the church. In fact, Mr Chairman we probably   need to say more than merely that the tragic result of this was that human rights   were not part of the mission of the church, because indeed, a number of our   Evangelical christians began to be part of a broader programme, particularly   in the eighties that the government instituted in terms of its programme to   win the hearts and minds of South Africans. You will remember that in the mid-eighties,   there was a time when the government of the day made a statement that churches,   in particular at that stage, I think the Dutch Reformed Church with a lot of   pressure from the World Church, was asked to no longer be involved in politics,   but to busy itself with spiritual methods. What the government at that stage   began to do more aggressively than it did in the past was to then recruit a   number of Evangelical groupings to become part of its counter-revolutionary   strategy and the phenomenon of right-wing religion began to multiply increasingly   in those years.\nAnd so, Mr Chairman it would probably be good if the TRC were to subpoena if   it was possible, some of the foot soldiers within our movement who could testify   about how it was that such things happened. Needless to say that these tensions   between the two traditions marks the history of Evangelicals in this country.   Those who stood for justice and human rights were often defrocked and victimised   by their own churches. \nIn making this submission the Evangelical Alliance of South Africa wishes to   state that we are a new body in the history of the church in South Africa. Having   being launched in 1995, there's an alliance of 31 denominations with membership   of over 2 million people. This launch brought together previously existing Evangelical   groupings. There was - ever since 1967, an Evangelic Fellowship of South Africa   which has existed up till the formation of the Evangelical Alliance.\nAnd there was another organisation representing mainly Black Evangelical's,   called Consandi Evangelicals that was launched in '85 and all these groups came   together in 1995, bringing on board a number of other ones of Evangelical Churches   that were for the most part not part of those two. So it is a culmination then   of a history of a search for Evangelical unity that started in the 60's.\nAt it's inauguration, the Evangelical Alliance of South Africa adopted a constitution   that states in it's preamble, that the Alliance recognises the ugly history   of apartheid in South Africa and the complicity of Evangelicals by commission   and omission in that history. This history was marked by racism and oppression.   Having learnt from this, our Alliance is committed to building a community marked   by dignity and justice. \nThe founding of the Alliance takes place in the context of transition to a   new non-racial, non-sexist and democratic South Africa. This transition is seen   a visitation of the mercies of God and provides an opportunity for a new ...[indistinct]   in Church and in society.\nThe submission of the Alliance therefore takes account of Evangelical practice   in the past and anticipates a future in which Evangelical Churches hope to fulfil   a prophetic role in which they make their contribution in the national search   for reconciliation, justice and human dignity.\nIt is also important to know that the Evangelicals were unanimous is espousing   one or other position in respect to the policies of the past. And I'd like to   mention a few points in relation to that and reflect on gross human rights violations   of the past. I think it is true to say that the Evangelical theology is by it's   very nature, such that a lot of the violations of the past are possible. With   few exceptions, the Evangelical community has historically maintained a conservative   theology. This is in marked contrast to the history of Evangelicalism world   wide. \nThis conservative theology tended to hold that firstly, faith and spirituality   are private concerns and little to do directly with social, political and cultural   concerns. The implication of this is that believers abdicated their social and   political responsibilities, adopting a stance of neutrality. In the context   of apartheid conflict of the last few decades, such neutrality would naturally   translate into uncritical support for the status quo.\nSimilarly because there was little worked out social or political theology,   believers who participated in the struggle against apartheid would have tended   to so without adequate theological rationale for what they were doing. And going   with what was pragmatic, effective and was done elsewhere, that would be normally   the way in which Evangelicals conducted themselves. Secondly, Evangelicals held   that God Almighty was in control and that in his good time he establishes authorities   and replaces them. \nSo that explains therefor Mr Chairman, the way in which Evangelicals justified   doing very little because everything was left to the intervention of God. In   fact it probably is not fair to say \"We did nothing, but there was lot's   of prayers to bring about change\".\nThe biblical text of Romans XIII, is largely interpreted to mean that the apartheid   Government was to be supported and defended. This was particularly strengthened   by the anti-communist mood of the times. The liberation movement was aligned   to socialism and communism and to that extent - and to the extent that Evangelical   movement is strongly influenced from the worst. The anti-communist posture of   the worst also became the abiding wisdom and pre-disposition of Evangelicals.\nThirdly, those who became involved against the struggle against apartheid -   the theology of liberation has exemplified in the biblical narrative of their   exodus, became the guiding paradigm. God took the side of the poor and this   raised the struggle of the poor to a moral high ground, making even the aberrations   within that struggle hard to critique. And I think in that sense, those of us   who participated probably could have done more to avoid some of the atrocities   that took place within that struggle.\nSecondly, the Evangelical contribution by commission and omission to the conflict   of the past. By it's failure to develop a theologian practice that took adequate   stock of social reality and relying only on private morality to guide people   through complexities of socio-political ideologies and conflicts, the Evangelical   community made believers easy prey to the forces of conflict. In fact, believers   became socially and politically and culturally incapacitated to act decisively,   authentically and in integrity either way.\nLooking at the question of how we failed to live up to the faith and how we   in that way, contributed to human rights violations. I think Evangelicals attempted   to justify the system of apartheid and rationalise their support for it. This   led to an embrace of a racist ideology in the ...[indistinct], in the theology   and in the structures of the church. And more concretely there's a sense in   which Evangelicals served in the military and police defence of apartheid -   and I just want to make one example that will explain this. \nIn the 80's, there was a time when the government identified the young people   particularly as being at the forefront of the struggle and there was a time   when the government recruited young people by the thousands from a lot of the   Black townships, to camps that were all expenses paid by government, inviting   Evangelical Pastors and Evangelists to proclaim the gospel to these young people   as a way - in a sense, of neutralising them from their political commitments.\nA typical testimony would come out of a young person - for example, I remember   a story of a young COSAS person who came away from such camps having discovered   faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, with eyes shining and saying \"I used to   be a member of COSAS, I used to be involved in the struggle and now I've received   Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour and I'm no longer involved\".\nSo in that sense, there was a way in which Evangelicalism became an antidote   that neutralised the people who were committed to a struggle for their own freedom.",

            "The second concrete way in which this happened was that Evangelicals   tended to oppose those who were involved in the struggle against apartheid and   vilified them. Thirdly, the apartheid segregationist policies were part and   parcel of the institutions and lastly, the legitimisation of human rights violations   by the State machinery in the whole anti-communist rationale of the time.\nReflecting on the future, I'd like to take this opportunity Mr Chairman, to   just thank the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in sense, for helping to   disclose the truth about the past because, because of that, there has been a   sense of awakening and a sense of realisation by a lot within our movement -   people who felt or did not know or claimed not to know, that a lot of these   things have been revealed. And we have seen a marked shift in a number of the   people, who in the past would have uninvolved and unconcerned. So, because of   the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, we have been able to find it easy to   mobilise local churches in particular, to become more actively involved with   the victims of human rights violations. And we've discussed this programme with   the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, to see in what way the churches at   a local level, can begin to be involved in reparation. \nWe've also set up a fund through which we make it possible for ordinary Evangelicals   to take personal ownership of the process of Reconciliation and Reparation because   - as you will remember, a few years ago at the Rustenberg Conference a lot of   our leadership confessed sins of omission and commission and it is an opportunity   - in the light of those confessions, to take the process forward and allow ordinary   Evangelicals, local churches and various institutions to begin to make personal   contributions to the process of reparation through a fund that we have set up.\nWe continue also to look at how we can bring human rights violations or human   rights as an issue, more centrally to the agenda of Evangelicals through a process   of education for democracy which we have started.

            "Thank you Mr Chairman. Just to add to what my colleague as stated   and further develop point number 3 - but briefly. Failing to live up to the   faith and contributing to human rights violations, we must confess - as Evangelical   Pentecostals, that our leadership frequently participated in government commissions.   An example the John Vorster Commission that led to the closing of the Christian   Institute and the banning of Doctor Beyers Naude, effectively demonising the   true prophetic voice which has left the church disadvantaged today. \nWhen 25 years ago we proclaimed the direction of the nation, the precipice   and the end result? - we were justiced by being told that Jesus Christ will   come before all that will happen. The slave mentality of the preponderous groups   within our church further empowered the conservative right. Frequently our leadership   travelled around the world to counter the SACC so-called propaganda, claiming   to speak for 11 million Evangelical Pentecostal christians.\nPoint 2 On our way forward. We need to say that the reconstruction and development   programme in building houses, sports fields and the upliftment of our community   is very important but we have a nation with an identity crisis. We have a nation   with damaged minds, we have cripple care societies which care for people with   broken backs and withered limbs but we do not have a society that cares for   people with broken minds.\nWe have people who hate themselves, hate the Negroid blood that flows in them   and if we do not give attention in the reconstruction - not just of schools,   but the reconstruction of the minds of our people, then we will miserably fail   our country at a time like this.\nThere's a necessity - finally Mr Chairman, to create a new value system concerning   life. We have a value system in South Africa where White life is very important   and Black life is nothing. Pro-life people want to protect the unborn child   and we as the church support that but those same people did not protect life   - living life, in children, youth and elderly, simply because they were Black.   And until we create a value system where all life - as created by God, is important,   we as the church will fail our society at this point in time. Thank you Mr Chairman.",

            "Mr Chairman, I'm going to make five points which will be about   five minutes.\nMy comments relate to Clause 2 of the primary document, which refers to the   failure of the Evangelical community to develop and adequate theology of social   reality. I wish to reflect on how this was manifest in the White section of   the conservative Evangelical community. \nIn describing this section of South African society, I must acknowledge that   there were christians of conservative Evangelical faith and other constituencies   already represented before the TRC, which could legitimately distance themselves   from the confession which follows. My hope is that this statement will assist   in the on-going confession and repentance of the constituency I will describe. \nPerhaps the primary value and distinguishing mark of the Evangelical community   is the place given to the authority and inspiration of scripture. A high view   of scripture is believed to provide a perspective which safeguards the church   from worldly thinking and keeps it faithful to it's mission.\nThe critical question is therefore, to what extent did this value work for   the church caught in the ideological struggle of the apartheid era? We have   to confess that the Evangelical community largely lost it's way and became as   captive to the ideologies of the day as any other part of South African society.\nGiven a context where ideologies from the right neo-facist and the left neo-marxist   were present, marxism was routinely demonised and the power of this ideology   was greatly exaggerated while the sinister influence of fascist ideology was   largely evaded or ignored. This, despite the rich biblical and church historical   heritage of terms like \"spiritual warfare\", \"the unmasking of   the gods and of the spirit of the anti-Christ\", the tearing down of strongholds   in the mind and so on.\nThis partisan spirituality was nowhere more evident than when the church prayed   for the State. Prayers against a threat of communism and revolution were filled   with far greater zeal than prayers against the violations of human rights perpetrated   at the time.\nThe Evangelical Church also has a rich heritage of social relevance. The history   of church involvement in the development of human rights down through the centuries   and the testimony of Wilbur Force type role models, is well-known. Yet the South   African Evangelical community somehow managed to suffer from amnesia and opted   rather for a form of gnostic dualism where evangelising the soul was unrelated   to the transforming power of the Kingdom of God. Instincts of self-preservation   predominated over compassion for the poor.\nThe Evangelical Church prides itself in it's fidelity to ...[indistinct] trinal   orthodoxy and is often quick to repudiate ...[indistinct], yet the South African   conservative Evangelical community did not lead the way in discerning the heretical   nature of apartheid theology.\nScripture is unambiguous in the unity of the church in contrast to the fragmentation   of worldly society. Pentecost reverses Babel and Christ's blood creates a new   community where dividing walls are broken down, yet many of the denominational   structures reflected the divisions of South African society, nullifying the   testimony of scripture. \nIt is with sadness that we have to acknowledge that the Evangelical Alliance   and many of it's denominational constituencies emerged from previously divided   Evangelical structures only after the election of a new Government, so that   the church followed the example of the State rather than providing an example   to the State.\nThe Evangelical community we represent does have it's history of conferences,   statements, publications and positions, adopted in the struggle against apartheid.   There were individuals and congregations who courageously exemplified a truly   biblical witness.\nHowever, in general, our testimony is one of failure to be faithful to the   word of God we so highly value. We did not act as the lemon and salt of society   Jesus called us to. This failure must be acknowledged before God, to ourselves   and to the South African national.\nOur ability to be deceived in the past requires us to critically reflect on   our understanding of the gospel as it relates to society. The future calls us   to discover a practice of missions and evangelism where biblical discipleship   takes on new meaning. \nIt will need to include biblical teaching on social ethics, human rights, the   empowering of disadvantaged communities and nation building. We will nee to   make our contribution to nation building in the face of new challenges and threats   to the emergence of a truly civil society.\nThank you.",

            "Thank you. Right you are Ray?\nPASTOR McCAULEY Commissioners, religious leaders, special guest, ladies and   gentlemen, I must say that this is a first for me - that half the congregation   left before I even started preaching, normally they go about halfway through.\nI'm here today in my capacity as President of the International Federation   of Christian Churches, it's an organisation that came into being in 1984 and   consists in excess of 400 churches countrywide. Rhema, my own church, is a member   of the organisation and incidentally also this church which is hosting these   TRC hearings. We also have close links with the larger Pentecostal and Evangelical   fraternity in South Africa and the South African Council of Churches.\nWe're often boastful about our spirituality but today we come in humility,   as we have to confess our shortcomings of the past. It's sad to admit that we   often hid behind our so-called spirituality and ignored the stark reality of   the dark events of the apartheid age. And as Pastors we delighted in preaching   and teaching about the good samaritan and pointing the finger at others, while   all the time we should have applied the lesson to ourselves.\nParalysed by false respect for government authority, most of your White charismatic   and Pentecostal church followers were simply spectators to the horrible acts   of abuse to humanity in this country. When we should have been comforting and   praying for those in desperate need, we sometimes joined the cheering crowds   and urged on the gladiators who in this modern day was a ruthless security force   machine that crushed any foe that dared to shout freedom.\nWe must confess that many of us allowed ourselves to be swayed and manipulated   by a government propaganda machine that tried to portray freedom fighters as   the enemies of the church and of Christianity in particular. We, the White members   of our leadership of our charismatic and Pentecostal churches, sincerely seek   the forgiveness of our Black counterparts within the church.\nMany of these Black leaders tried to show us the error of our ways but pride   and often a sense of superiority blinded us. Instead of hearing the cry of their   hearts, we rebuked, offended, and even at times ostracised them for their honest   efforts to speak truth in love.\nWe seek the forgiveness of our colleagues within the larger religious community   for the times when we lacked the courage and conviction to walk alongside you   in your demands for justice and righteousness. We seek the forgiveness of those   who are willing to bear the scars of rejection, humiliation, persecution for   their campaign to isolate through sanctions, a minority government and by this   peaceful means bring into submission. Forgive us for our short-sightedness and   selfishness.\nThe tragedy of this ineptness and sometimes callous attitude of hundreds of   thousands of christians will forever stain the history of Christianity in South   Africa. The guilt of many South African christians is even greater because of   the laws of apartheid and the subsequent abuse of power by a security system.   And a police force that at times seemed to come from the pit of hell, was aimed   at fellow christians.\nLike the madness of Northern Ireland, we saw christians persecuting christians   in Southern Africa. Men who sang the same hymns and said the same prayers and   belonged even to the same denominations became mortal enemies outside of the   sanctuary of God but God's seen it all, not one of those evil deeds of the apartheid   era has gone unnoticed.\nWe know that many christians within our constituency still to this day, find   it hard to accept any responsibility for what happened in the past. In 1990,   when I attended the historic Rustenberg Conference, I was challenged by the   willingness of Professor Willie Jonker to make a bold confession on behalf of   the Dutch Reformed Church. This forced me to consider the part that our constituency   had played during the apartheid era and it was in a hotel room at Rustenberg,   that I got together with other leaders of Pentecostal denominations. \nI felt this was an important moment in time for us to confess our failure,   to oppose apartheid and take the challenge to our various constituencies. Unfortunately,   we could not all agree that it was the right time for confession and only one   other grouping joined me in making a confession at Rustenberg.\nAs much as the Commission's work has to do with the past, I'd like to read   that confession made in Rustenberg just over seven years ago. It reads\n\"Despite our short history we recognise our guilt in that for some us   our opposition to apartheid did not go far enough, nor was it effectively expressed.   While others of us adapted a so-called \"neutral stance\" which resulted   in complicity in the system. Our statements and conviction were often not adequately   put in practical action and as a result we were often silent when our sisters   and brothers were suffering persecution.\nWe confess that our silence in this area was in fact sin and that our failure   to act decisively against all forms of apartheid made us party to and inhuman   political ideology. We therefore confess our failure and repent of our sin,   declare our complete rejection of all forms of racism and evil unjust system   of apartheid. Please, forgive us.\nFurther, as part of the family of God, we declare our resolve to play an active   and positive role in ensuring that all people receive an equal opportunity to   take part in all forms of political, economical and social life in the post-apartheid   South Africa. Please, forgive us\".\nLooking back at those words, I thank God for his generous grace for helping   me and the leadership to make that confession then. The reason why I say this   is because it cleared the way for us to go forward. I'm not for one moment suggesting   that it absolved our people of personal responsibility because confession and   repentance is a very personal matter but it helped me to help others to not   only face the past but to have a positive vision for the future.\nMuch of the work of this Commission and the majority of the presentations and   hearings, have dealt with the problems of the past but I think we would be naive   to believe that these hearings have achieved everything that we may have prayed   for and hoped for. In fact, I believe that the TRC is the starting point for   true reconciliation in our country. \nConfession of past sins - whether of commission or omission, may bring pardon   but confession is not complete without two vital components. They are powerful   theological words which religion knows well, they are repentance and forgiveness.   The act of confession does not mean that the person has really repented, confession   is a starting point to a process that should lead to lasting reconciliation.   This is why repentance is so important in the vocabulary of the church, it is   the through the act of repentance that we see the fruit of our confession.\nThe thief no longer steals the lie, tells the truth, the cheat becomes an honest   person. Repentance means a complete turn around. Sadly, though the repentance   is not forthcoming because the confession has not been what we in the church   would recognise as a confession of sin. Many people in our society are prepared   to admit that apartheid was a mistake and offer a half-hearted apology for the   past.\nThat sort of confession in my mind, is cheap and it fails to get to grips with   a true confession which leads to repentance and that in turn leads to meaningful   forgiveness, followed by restitution and reconciliation. There is no easy road   to reconciliation, in fact we may be deceiving ourselves to even talk about   reconciliation for apartheid has been so successful in keeping generations of   South Africans apart, that only now are we setting off on a journey to truly   find each other.\nThe road to true reconciliation is signposted with confession of your past   sins, repentance, forgiveness and restitution. One of the most beautiful pictures   of this is found in the Bible account of Jesus and the Tax Collector, Zakeus.   It is a story of an extraordinary conversion by a man who held a privileged   position in society, he was wealthy - and if he was alive today, most probably   will look like Danny de Vito, but from the story we gather that he abused the   trust and authority he had in society.\nWhen he was confronted with his sin he repented and the outcome was a voluntary   offer to make restitution to those he had taken advantage of. The evidence of   a sincere confession and repentance should always be followed by a desire to   make amends wherever possible. We would be doing an injustice to the TRC if   we simply remembered it as an event that only exposed the evil of our past.   Without this necessary exposure of the past, we would have built our future   on lies, deceptions and half truths.\nIt may be that we have not brought out all the truth of the past but there   can be no denying that all South Africans now know that the history of apartheid   is not golden but rather that our past is clouded with tragedy and shame. But   as dark as our past may have been, I believe we now have a sufficient foundation   of truth on which to build a future that will never allow an ideology to rob   millions of it's citizens of it's basic human rights.\nI think it's most fitting that the churchmen have been given this opportunity   to speak at the TRC because I believe that we, more than the politicians or   the business world, have the spiritual capacity to rebuild the moral fibre and   the dignity of the people in our nation. Christianity, despite the failings   of it's followers, offers new beginnings, new life and it's faith that believes   in redemption. It is a faith that cares and has compassion for human kind, it   is a faith that inspired hymns like \"Amazing Grace\", that gave us   the words \"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, save the wretch like me.   Once I was lost but now I'm found, once I was blind but now I see\".\nTo many of us in this room today the transition to our fledging democracy has   been a divine miracle, it has been amazing grace that saved our land from civil   war. The shameful wretch of apartheid is behind us, we are finding our way and   the scales are falling from our eyes day by day. I have no hesitation in saying   that only God's amazing grace is going to carry us further on the road to reconciliation   where dignity and prosperity will be freely available to all our people.\nA political revolution has taken place in our nation. What I plead for today   is that, out of the pain and suffering - cauldron of the TRC hearings, we begin   a moral revolution that will break the curse of poverty an pain. A moral revolution   that will eradicate corruption from business, government and the services of   law and order. Our own President stated that approximately 80% of the police   are some way involved in corruption.\nA moral revolution that will teach young people right from wrong, a moral revolution   that will cherish human life and dignity, a moral revolution that will treat   all South Africans - young and old, as valuable and precious in the sight of   God. Deliverance from the yoke of apartheid has brought freedom, now we need   to honour that freedom by acknowledging that it comes to us with a high price. \nSouth Africans' road to true reconciliation means a new appreciation of freedom.   Countless horror stories have been told to the TRC of young men and young women,   of mothers and fathers who died and suffered to bring down apartheid. It is   a present tragedy that the blood spilt by so many to win freedom, is being trampled   underfoot by criminals who terrorise our streets and by white collar crooks   who salt away the wealth of our land by devious and unethical business tricks.\nAnd we can point a finger at government departments as well but I'm ready to   acknowledge that the church too has it's responsibility to chasen it's congregations   to live lives worthy of their faith. It was Jesus who said \"Why do you   look at the speck of the sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention   to the plank in your own eye? How can you save your brother? - let me take the   speck out of your own eye, when all the time there is a plank in your eye. You   hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, then you will see clearly   to remove the speck from your brother's eye\"\nSo I think it is only right that the church has been called to make it's confessions   here at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and I'm also saying that we   as christians who believe in the higher laws of God, must set the tone and the   value system for reconciliation to become a reality within our congregations.   There is no place for prejudice and racism within our sanctuaries. The Bible   may have been abused in the past to bolster a manmade ideology but let's get   back to what God intended for his people and that is peace, joy and ...[indistinct]   in the Spirit of Christ. \nChurch leaders - especially those who still have predominantly White congregations,   are going to have to challenge their people to be peacemakers, to stretch out   their hand of fellowship. The church has so much to offer South Africa and it   must not fail in it's God-given opportunity to share the love, compassion and   healing of the gospel.\nThis is going to have to mean a lot more than just loving - having a loving   sermon. As I said earlier \"Heartfelt confession will bring forth truth   repentance which in turn produces a new outlook and a changed attitude\",   this must result in restitution and good works. Faith says the Bible is dead   without works. When we use faith and works together, we have a dynamic force   for change and for good in our nation.\nRestitution or reparation has to happen. There is hardly a White person in   South Africa who did not benefit in some way - no matter how small, from apartheid.   We benefited in the field of education, business, sports, arts and in everyday   life by having better bus services, train services - and I'm the first to admit   today, that I got benefits from the apartheid system.\nMaybe I didn't get it deliberately to mistreat or deprive others but Black   people certainly never enjoyed the rights and privileges that I did when I was   at school and when I was a young man. So we have to face the challenge of restitution   head-on. The issue of land acquisition is key to giving people a sense of dignity   and belonging, and my sincere prayer is, that those church organisations that   hold unused property will generously show the hand of true christian charity   - this is could be - in some areas, a wonderful example of restitution. \nFor younger organisations like the one I lead, the challenge is to give back   something to our communities and that is not hard to do if there is a willing   heart and a willing spirit. The poor are all around us, homeless people are   dumped on the pavements and street children wander aimless through our cities'   streets - these are all opportunities for restitution.\nAnd because of the past failures in the country, we who believe in the christian   faith carry a heavy responsibility to be the shepherds that lead South Africa   into the pastures of peace and prosperity. And I personally have a dream of   a nation that will hold it's head high, where the dignity and life of each individual   regardless of colour, is recognised as a sacred gift from God Almighty.\nIn closing, we commit our churches and our congregations to boldly walk the   road of reconciliation, to build a nation under God that will be a growing testimony   to the international world. We applaud the TRC and it's dedicated members for   taking on this most difficult task of opening up the soul of the nation, but   we believe that the people of faith with loving and caring hearts, will soothe   the wounds and help dry the tears of our nation.\nI have a very short addendum which will take another minute or two and I'm   nearly on time - blessed are the short-winded. This section is added to our   statement to give some practical idea of what steps our churches are taking   to make restitution in a way that adds value to the lives of those who are marginilised   for so many years. \nOne of these areas - we feel that our network of churches can make a really   significant contribution to the upliftment of the less privileged, is in the   area of housing. Besides trying to help the homeless and the poorest of the   poor with soup kitchens, literacy classes and clinics, we are gearing up for   a pilot project in Gauteng where we'll work with the local government authorities   to provide a housing estate.\nThe concept is simply to enter into a partnership with local authorities who   will provide land and services while we as the church, will raise the finances   for the houses. Besides this, we will call on our congregational members to   provide their skills on all the various areas of building and work with the   local people on a self-help scheme that will see people building their own homes   and owning them.\nThis project has been on ice for two years because of the difficulties that   the local authorities had in getting suitable land for development, but we believe   that this will be able to start with a pilot scheme in Gauteng next year. Once   this pilot scheme has proved itself we plan to role out the project across the   country to other cities, towns where they have churches and where our partnerships   can be established with local authorities.\nPart of this scheme is also to provide small business opportunities nearby   the proposed estates, so that the areas will be economically sustainable. We   believe this project - using the volunteer expertise available among the privileged   members of our congregations, will make a valuable contribution to uplifting   our local communities and of giving Whites in particular a practical way of   making restitution.\nIn the meanwhile, some of our churches have come to the rescue of some homeless   groups which have been evicted and have offered shelter on their own property.   The measures of course are only short-term and our main focus is on providing   permanent homes. Besides our proposed housing scheme, some of our churches in   the cities are involved with street children. \nIn Johannesburg we have the establishment of an orphanage which already is   producing wonderful results among the children who were once lost in the streets   of Hillbrow. In Mpumalanga Province our churches have been engaged in a water   scheme and has seen the establishment of clean fresh water tanks. Boreholes   are now available in many villages and this has helped to reduce - in our small   way, sickness in those areas which previously came from using polluted water.\nLike many, many other churches that have done more than us, we are continually   engaged in running literacy classes, doing our best to help in the clinics and   particularly getting involved in the informal settlements. We believe that our   churches can and will make a substantial contribution to improving the living   standards of the poor and the homeless. It is the least we can do for those   who are deprived of so much by our failures and sins in the past.",

Pastor Ray, your submission has dealt very practically   with the issue of restitution, in fact I started wondering whether I'm listening   to a Pentecostal person because normally you deal with the matters in a very   spiritual level and very practically you have dealt with this matter.\nI would like to just put a question that I put through to Chief Rabbi Harris   yesterday. In our Business Hearing there was a practical proposal of how we   could deal with the fact that this country happens to have the biggest gap between   those who have and have in abundance and those who are having very little, in   fact subsist from day to day.

I think that it is very important that we do that and I wish   that certain people would take that initiative without anybody making them do   it. \nOne of the reservations that have come up - which I believe then we should   put conditionally into that, is that we need to make sure that the funds are   distributed to those who need to get it - I don't want the gravy to get any   thicker if it is in anyway there, so I think we'll have to build in some conditions.",

The Baptists appear before this Commission in two separate groups, The Baptist   Union of South Africa and the Baptist Convention of South Africa and we are   extremely glad to be able to make this submission together, after a painful   division in our Baptist ranks in past years. \nOn behalf of the Baptist Union, comprising 426 churches excluding roughly a   similar number of fellowships with an active membership of 42.000, not including   adherence in children. The Baptist Union of South Africa is culturally and racially   diverse, Evangelical in it's theological persuasion and congregational in it's   system of government, with each local church being autonomous.\nWe would like to outline briefly what the Union did in speaking against apartheid   over the years. Secondly, we want to express our confession in not putting our   reservations to practice, both as a denomination internally and then not sufficiently   challenging the legitimacy of apartheid policies in actual practice.\nWe would like to express our repentance for the hurts and pain that the actions   of the Baptist Union cause, both to it's own membership and to the wider body   of christians and citizens in South Africa. \nFinally, we would like briefly to express what God has enabled us to do in   putting our own house in order and in building relationships towards reconciliation   and forgiveness with fellow Baptist in the convention and within our country   as a whole.\nFirstly then, during the years of apartheid the assembly of the Baptist Union   which met annually from 1877 and made up of delegates from members churches,   passed a resolution after resolution against racism and apartheid. And I've   asked the Reverend Peter Hollness if he would briefly summarise these resolutions.",

            "Archbishop and Commissioners, I'll try to be a brief Baptist   confining myself to four minutes. My task is to summarise briefly what the Baptist   Union of Southern Africa did ...[no sound] We certainly didn't do enough, we   were too pietistic and theoretical and we didn't do justice to our own Baptist   heritage which is rich in it's prophetic witness to society.\nCompared to some, our contribution is modest but nevertheless it should not   be overlooked. Many individual Baptists actively opposed apartheid, others exercised   a ministry of caring and compassion. Some local congregations protested against   iniquitous practices such as forced removals, in one instance by standing in   front of the bulldozers and on another by symbolically planting orange trees.\nBaptists were prominent in opposing and in fact changing the law relating to   military conscription. Whilst principle was often not converted into practice,   the Baptist Union consistently and frequently expressed it's rejection of apartheid   through assembly pronouncement, correspondence and delegations to the government.   Apartheid was rejected on both theological and compassionate grounds, it was   sinful and immoral and hurtful, not to mention unworkable.\nI quote a few examples to illustrate our Baptist Union position over the past   half century. The 1948 assembly condemned - quote \nSocial and economic injustice of early apartheid and the breaking of solemn   pledges given to the non-european people of the Union. The 1949 assembly condemned   the economic and political repression of the apartheid system and urged the   government not to remove coloured voters from the voters role and to repeal   the Mixed Marriages Act.\nThe Baptist Union rejected so-called Bantu education and would not operate   it's mission schools within this system. In 1957, the Baptist Union threatened   civil disobedience when the government tried unsuccessfully to enforce segregated   church worship.\nThe 1985 assembly authorised a letter to the State President, which declared   unequivocally that apartheid is an evil which needs to be repented of and urged   it's immediate dismantling. It also called - quote\nOn the basis of true christian justice for universal franchise, one national   education system, the abolition of influx control and the dom pass, equal pay   for equal work, the accountability of the South African Defence Force and police   forces, the termination of the state of emergency and of detention without trial,   the removal of the group areas act and the release of political prisoners and   the return of political exiles.\nOur assembly resolutions were defective in several ways, notably in their caution,   limited focus and theoretical nature. They were however, a sincere attempt to   relate biblical principles to South African society. Assembly resolutions did   not put all the blame on government policies, many recognised the weaknesses   in our own denominational structures and practice. \nThe 1991 assembly agreed that even though we can't bear all the blame for apartheid,   we can't ignore our part in it - it was sinful, hurtful and wrong. The assembly   confessed that as Baptists, we too have been guilty. We have sinned in our attitudes   and in our actions, for this we humbly repent. We acknowledge that true repentance   will go beyond mere words and will manifest itself in a change of attitude and   in positive action.\nThen followed a commitment to be involved in the process of building a new   nation. This assembly therefore urges the Baptist Union and all it's constituent   churches to exercise a constituent prophetic ministry and to work for the creation   of a new society, based on the biblical principles of respect, justice and righteousness.   We shall seek - by precept and by practice, to bring about a moral and spiritual   reformation in all aspects of our community life. \nCommissioners, it is in this spirit and with this commitment that we appear   before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, thank you.",

            "Mr Chairman, we want to make it clear that those resolutions were   passed by the Baptist Union Assembly when the Convention and Union were one   body. However, one of our members has said that we might have plastered the   walls of parliament with our resolutions but notwithstanding these resolutions,   the Baptist Union did not put them into practice both internally or externally.\nWe confess that within the structures of our own Baptist Union, we practised   apartheid. For instance, we established theological training institutions to   cater to for the cultural diversity of our denomination and it was only in 1986   that we closed the college exclusively to train Black pastors, in order to train   students for the ministry together.\nOur national executive was dominated by White members and right up until 1989,   had only one Black representative on the leadership body. It follows then that   decision making and policy setting for the Baptist Union was done by Whites,   most often without any consultation with the Black members of our churches. \nRight up until 1987, we kept separate lists for White and Black pastors and   White and Black churches. Many of our decisions mirrored the status quo during   the apartheid years and for this we humbly repent. Associations within the Baptist   Union are also formed on racial and linguistic lines - for instance, within   the Baptist Union was the Association of Churches from the Afrikaans community   which formed the Afrikaanse Baptiste Kerk, the Black churches formed the Baptist   Convention, the Indian Churches the Baptist association of South Africa and   the Baptist Mission. As you can see, our denomination reflected apartheid in   it's overall structure.\nDuring these years - apart from the resolutions that we passed, we did not   sufficiently challenge the legitimacy of unjust institutions in our country   or the apartheid policies. We tended to marginalise those who wanted to do more   than simply speak against apartheid within our ranks. We did little to alleviate   the sufferings of the oppressed people of South Africa. The White members of   our denomination benefited from apartheid structures socially and economically. \nThe assembly in 1991, expressed the Baptist Union's repentance in the following   words\n\"This assembly of the Baptist Union of Southern Africa gives thanks to   God that statuary apartheid has been abolished. We acknowledge that statutory   apartheid was but a symptom of tradition, traditional and ingrained attitudes   within society and sadly, even within our church. \nAs Baptist we too have been guilty and to our shame - as individuals and churches,   have sinned in our actions and attitudes, we've allowed them to be governed   by the pattern obtaining in society. We have conformed when we ought to have   confronted.\nWhile we have condemned the legislation, many of us have enjoyed the economic   and social privileges resulting from it, for this we humbly repent. We acknowledge   that true repentance will go beyond mere words and must manifest itself in a   change of attitude and in positive action\"\nIn 1987, the Baptist Union went through a painful division within our ranks.   Approximately 60% of the Black churches within the Convention Association withdrew   from the Baptist Union, to form a separate body namely, the Baptist Convention   of South Africa. We acknowledge that attitudes and actions reflecting apartheid   within the Baptist Union were partly responsible for this division. \nThe Baptist Union has acknowledged that our relationship with the Convention   has caused much pain. And heart searching negotiations within our brother -   and negotiations with our brother body have not been easy as we have sought   to come to grips with attitudes and actions of the past, including our sins   of commission and omission.\nI've asked the Reverend George Ngamlama, lecturer at the Baptist Theological   College, Pastor of the Nancefield Church and past Associate General Secretary   of our Union to share very briefly, something of what we are seeking to do to   address the sins of the past.",

I'm going to deal with the structure, the leadership,   the development and a word to our members and our relationship with the convention.\nLooking at the BU structure We have removed from the BU, associations formed   on basis of race from constitutional structures of the Baptist Union. We are   striving to reflect the unity of the body of Christ in our denomination. \nUnder leadership The leadership of the Union in the past was predominantly   White and male.

For our member churches we have initiated   BU care - that is, Baptist Union Community Assistance and Relief and I quote   \"To motivate and enable Baptist churches to witness to Christ through social   concern and social action that will empower deprived communities to address   their physical, social and other needs and to provide relief when necessary\"\nOur relationship with the Baptist Convention After many years of struggle   and conflict, we have committed ourselves to a process which will heal the hurts   of the past and to work together in fellowship as brother bodies of Christ.

            "So, I think the submission will therefore focus on the experience   of our church prior to 1987 and also subsequent to that. We as representatives   are deeply aware of our constituency that we represent, people that have suffered   and experienced a great deal of suffering, people like Fenus Mapetu, Simon Lukwe,   Gideon Makanja and the late John Darries, the late Reverend Kumalo, Mahola etc.   And we therefore are deeply thankful to the Commission for granting us the privilege   to place before this ...[indistinct], the experience of Black Baptists in this   country.\nI want to elude briefly to the struggle of Black Baptists against apartheid   in this country. The struggle for Black Baptists against apartheid was a struggle   within the church, it was also a struggle to justify one's fight against that   system to a church that was providing the moral, spiritual support for that   system. The struggle meant challenging the import ...[indistinct] theological   framework labelled as \"Conservative Evangelical\".\nThis framework had an inherent arrogance that gave itself the right to declare   that it discovered absolute truth all on it's own, it refused to accept the   european cultural, social or political framework within this theology was formed.   This led to a debilitating separatist ...[indistinct] mentality fuelled by such   concepts as the remnant who were prosecutors and custodians of God's truth and   values. \nI just want to highlight some of the effects of this theology\nIt ...[indistinct] life for Black christians between secular and spiritual   and so it made us as Black christians, to separate our faith experience with   our life experience. I mention for example, personally as a theological student   while studying theology in the 1980's, living within a stones throw away from   St Barnabus where many historical resolutions were taken by people like yourself   Sir, Doctor Boesak, Naude and Chikane, and how that I could not reconcile those   historic developments with theology. That that event did not inform my theology   because it was politics and it was separate from my reality.\nAnd so we live the kind of dichotomised life that was reflected in statements   like \"You can rather send a man to heaven hungry than to send him to hell   with a full stomach\". Students at college - you know institutions, were   victimised for taking part in simple marches like Pollsmoor, to call for the   freedom of our President today, as well as also observing alternative holidays   in those days like June the 16th. This was a dichotomy - it was also a dichotomy,   it was also a theology that made Black Baptist to embrace the fears of Whites.\nI refer to our submission to similar experience in the United States where   the great leader Malcolm X talked about two kinds of Black people and those   times, the house slave and the field slave and how that house slave developed   and ethos, an experience to associate life his life experience with the master   so that when the master was sick, he felt the same pain as the master felt and   said \"Master, we are sick\".\nAnd in some ways we have as Black Baptists - when there was liberation in our   country or also significant processes, we were deprived by our theology to enter   into those experiences because inheriting that theology was the same fears of   White people. The difficult thing for us therefore as Black Baptists, was not   that we faced the threat of communism or the threat of liberation theology but   the pain of our experience is that our oppression came from our sisters and   brothers.\nWe place ...[indistinct] on record however, even though we have not participated   as we should have as Black Baptists in the struggle for liberation, we thank   God for our international Baptist community, particularly our African/American   Baptist community who made a major contribution to our liberation. We thank   God for people like Jesse Jackson, Senator Bill Grey, Charles Adams, W Smith,   Wyate Walker, Clifford Jones, Jerry Sanders and even Leon Sullivan, for formulating   the Sullivan principles.\nThe Baptist World Alliance exerted continued pressure on the apartheid government   even though they did not do enough. Individuals, such as Keith Clemmence, the   present General Secretary of the European Council of Churches as well as Pierre   ...[indistinct] a Norwegian church person, the American Baptist Churches in   their fight for disinvestemnt was the forefront of this campaign.\nIn 1987, when we separated from the Baptist Union, we had to go on a journey   to discover our rich Baptist heritage of liberation and freedom, we had to embrace   people like Doctor Martin Luther King Junior and also the great President Doctor   Jimmy Carter. ...[indistinct] the true Baptists have a reputation of being troublemakers   - if fighting for freedom, is considered making trouble and yes, Baptists have   a history of non-conformance.\nBaptists were amongst the first free church type who refused to acknowledge   the King and Queen, ...[indistinct] or any other secular person, as the head   of the church and for this killed and martyred. And today we accept - it is   with deep sadness that we regret that we, both Black and White Baptists have   betrayed our ancestors and have not pursued the freedom fight with the kind   of vigour and commitment demanded by our own tradition.\nWe have all been responsible for selling out our ancestors and defrocking our   heritage of it's radical socio-political edge, allowing apartheid ideology to   co-opt and relegate Baptist theology to racial exclusive church bench on a Sunday   morning. \nWe want to note Sir, that we have had Baptists - we had to make choices and   that we as a Baptist community disowned by our practices, those who were conscripts,   those who suffered in Robben Island, those were in exile. And in 1977, when   we were still part of the Baptist Union that reflected our ethos, it was the   100 years celebration of the Baptist Union of Southern Africa and at that time,   to open that occasion the then State President, the Honourable Doctor Jim Fouche   was asked to come.\nAt that same assembly it was announced that Steve Biko had died and would be   buried that same Saturday. A resolution was taken that we should not express   ourselves in any way, on the death of Steve Biko as that had no consequence   to us. That demonstrated to us our ...[indistinct] as Baptists at that particular   time. \nWe have amongst our ranks ordinary pastors like Pastor Lukwe, who - all he   did was make the hall of his church available to the United Democratic Front   at that time and was threatened by fellow Baptists to stop that kind of action.   He was imprisoned, his wife came home and found that they were evicted from   their manse, only because they made the hall of the church available to that   community.\nWe have people like Gideon Makanje that was arrested and that was interrogated   by fellow Baptists. We have the late John Darries coming from a Baptist World   Alliance Meeting and taken from the aircraft at Jan Smuts and taken to John   Vorster Square for interrogation. We have a Baptist Missionary on the role of   the Baptist Union, arrested in Zambia because he was found to be involved with   dubious activities with the South African Defence Force. \nThe Baptist Union, the Baptists in general have embraced the military establishment,   they've elected people that were in high office of the South African Defence   Force, to the highest position of leadership. In 1989, the Baptists showed their   colours by holding the annual assembly in the barracks of the South African   Defence Force in Kimberly. \nFor these things, we as Baptists today feel ashamed but God has given us a   second chance, God has given a vision called \"Vision Jubilee 2010\"   and God has given to us as Black Baptists, a promise that we believe he will   fulfil and it says \"I will restore to you the years that the locust have   eaten\".\nWe know that God is going to help us to work towards the economic reconstruction   of our country, to help us to re-educate theologically our constituency from   a process of dependency to liberation. He will help us also to develop programmes   of development, he will help us to develop leadership and to take our place   as a reconciled community.\nAmidst all of this pain and suffering we have kept our hands out to our sisters   and brothers within the Baptist Union, to seek reconciliation on the basis of   truth and justice. We thank God that the atmosphere amongst us has increased   dramatically to make that possible. We thank God that we've committed ourselves   next year to a Baptist Truth and Reconciliation Commission where we can expose   our pain and ask those difficult questions - to seek forgiveness, repentance   and healing and restitution.\nThere is much work to be done but we make a promise that as sure as we are   seated here and we are sure that the promises that God has given to us, that   we will take up our place as a Baptist community in rebuilding our country,   in fighting poverty and developing the human resources of our people. \nWe thank you for these moments even though we had to shorten it dramatically   to contribute to what we are saying. We thank God for your leadership Sir, for   the TRC and we thank God that we were able in a small way, to participate and   endorse in our assemblies the objectives of this Committee both by ourselves   and by our international partners.

Today we consist of 1.200 congregations,   1.800 pastors and 650.000 members apart from adherence.\nWe are thankful for this forum, we know it is not perfect but then the AFM   also is not perfect. The TRC is the only forum with some credibility and acceptability   available to us in which we can publicly apologise to all those who had been   hurt by the travesties of the past. It is the most effective way available to   us which we can use to offer help and healing to those who had committed unacceptable,   often even gruesome deeds against fellow South Africans.\nAnd that offer goes for people on all sides of the line. There are few better   ways than this rostrum, from which the AFM can reach all those falling in all   these categories, that is why we are thankful for the TRC. As we have said earlier,   we were one when the AFM was founded but as time moved on and this fair country   became increasingly besotted by political and racial ideology, placing impediments   on multi-racial worship, we were ...[indistinct] asunder and ended up being   four churches, Indian, Black, White and Coloured.\nOur isolation never dampened the yearning to become one again and by the latter   part of the freedom struggle, we were close to unity. By the grace of God, at   Easter 1996, the AFM was able to celebrate it's new unity during a nationally   televised service at Centurion Park. This made us the first church denomination   to unify since the advent of our democracy. \nThere at Centurion Park spontaneously and obedience to God, I on behalf of   the former White AFM and Pastor Frank Chikane on behalf of the former composite   division - that was the Black, Indian, Coloured section, in public embraced   each other and sought forgiveness and transgression for transgressions committed   by the AFM churches and members against each other during the years of separation.   God in his great mercy, helped us to grant each other pardon.\nI've brought along a short edited video recording of this act and I trust that   it will be possible to just show it to you before the end of our submission.",

            "Thank you.\nWhat is evident and what was evident on that day - because of the spontaneous   character of the reconciliation that took place, was that we didn't only reach   structural unity but much more than that. I can honestly say that something   at the very heart of our church changed. We would not claim that we had reached   absolute spiritual cohesion at that point, such a claim would be arrogant. What   we can state unequivocally is that our unity and bonding are growing steadfastly.   We can state equally unequivocally that we are committed and determined to the   attainment of total unity in all senses of the word.\nCommissioners, we can today in all humility state that our original submission   to you is a sign of how the bonds in the AFM family are cementing. It is our   humble suggestion that our submission is a rather unique document. It is to   the best of our knowledge the only church submission to you in which members   of all colours of this rainbow nation accept collective responsibility for the   past.\nNot so long ago we would have regarded someone suggesting that such a thing   could happen in our church, a mad hatter. We thank God for letting truth, wisdom   and consensus prevail. Let me be unambiguously honest and say that all our members   did not agree with unity, some do not agree with our appearance here today.   We have had resignations, we have had poisoned mail, we have been labelled   \"sell-outs\", thus it must be clear to you that we have paid a price   for our convictions.\nWe proclaim fearlessly that we are doing what we are doing today - we believe,   is in line with the word of God and have no doubt that the future will prove   us correct. We took a look at ourselves and found that in all our ranks we had   members who had committed transgressions. For instance, the State being the   major employer during the apartheid years, many of our members worked for it.   Whichever way we may look at it, we helped to keep the system going and thereby   prolonged the hurt of apartheid. \nIn the more gruesome arena people were slain and injured on both sides of the   line, often people died without the approval of the previous government or the   struggle movements. There came days when people on all sides became severely   frustrated and vented their anger unilaterally. There were traitors on all sides,   some did it for money - life was hard, at times hunger pains and cold put out   minds the virtues of morality and ethics. \nOthers did it because they thought they were doing the nation and God a service,   fighting what they had been indoctrinated to believe was ungodly. One of the   people here with me today was tortured on a Sunday morning by a fellow AFM member   who then went off to church, it is sickening but true. But one needs to look   at the days we were living in, be it far from me to push blame recklessly onto   another establishment. The fact is, that the ordinary man in the street was   dependent on the media for information. \nThe State machinery controlled the print and the electronic media by way of   legislation or direct holding, as was the case of the SABC. When Pastor Chikane   and I were born, much of this already was the case. So on the one side, Whites   were steadily being indoctrinated through liberal doses of contorted and distorted   information, while people of colour were increasingly being incensed.\nShould we not have been more critical of what we were told, should we not have   challenged and resisted more? The questions are many and the answer to all of   them is \"Yes, we all failed terribly\". However, the fact is that   by the time most of us were born, the National Party already was in power. I   was born and reared in an environment in which one did no challenge - I'm stating   this as a fact, I'm not using it in mitigation.\nBut Commissioners, this brings me to what we consider the cardinal reason for   the AFM delegation being here today. We have admitted the errors of our ways,   we have apologised collectively and individually to each other. We have apologised   to those beyond the reach of the AFM which we might have caused harm to. We   now are faced by the enormous task of getting to grips with questions such as   reconciliation, healing, bridge building, poverty, joblessness, creating a mentality   of challenging government and keeping an eye on those ruling over us, in a bid   to prevent the mistakes and sins of yesteryear being repeated.\nQuestions, such as investment, education and the most prickly of pears, recompense.   Healing alone is multi-ferrous in nature. There is the question of healing needed   by those who suffered, the demands of healing needed by those who dispense suffering.   The poser of healing of those bereaved by the...[indistinct] system.\nThe problem of healing those hardened and turned inhumane by frustration and   indoctrination. The liberating healing of those embittered because their land   and belongings have been seized. There is the effort needed in healing those   who cannot come to grips with the past, of those baffled by what is now happening   and of those without any framework of reference of yesterday and less of tomorrow.   And there is healing attainable only through reparation, be it spiritual, physical   or financial.\nThe finest remedy to bring about all these cures remains the gospel of Jesus   Christ. As a united church, we believe we are well placed and consider it our   duty at the very least, to do all within the reach of our cable tow to bring   about healing. We are today committed to a continuous programme of communications   and interfaction, interfacing with the larger of South African society.\nCommunications have been severely - and to our detriment, overlooked by our   church and we are today taking expert opinion on this matter. In line with this,   we are actively promoting efforts aimed at helping our members of different   colour groups to get to know each other. As this drive of getting to know brothers   and sisters across colour lines gains momentum, we are seeing increasing signs   of acceptance.\nAcceptance in turn is helping us to get to know the history of the AFM better.   It is a necessity that the true history of the AFM be written and taught to   our members. We believe today that the better a people knows it's history, the   more unlikely it is that it will again in future fall into the same pitfalls   of the past.\nWe are finding that as we give ...[indistinct] to this side of our effort,   our people are developing increasing empathy and sympathy with those who suffered   and with those who caused the suffering. Some suffered because of what they   believed to be the right things to do, others are today suffering because of   guilt of what they had done to those. In this atmosphere of growing understanding,   we are prompting people to venture into areas that had been alien to them before   - call it bridge building if you wish.\nAnd it is at this point where we find the real truth emerging. This well nigh   jealous pursuit of truth we regard as the single most important ingredient of   the elixir of healing, this is hard work but we want to assure you that we are   determined to reach our goal. It is in line with this that we are in the process   of re-evaluating our training programmes and taking a fresh look at our educational   institutions.\nWe believe we need to give our pastors a clear picture of what we are doing   and why, they are the leaders and can give it through to the congregations and   societies they operate in. Wee are trying our hardest to make the church more   accessible to all. We are propounding our belief that the idea of our buildings   for instance being used only on Sundays for worshipping, should be ended.\nA church serves it's community, be it a soup kitchen, a creche or school   and in this way the people will feel more at home and it will help to spread   the gospel to them. In this way also, our pastors will get a better insight   into the grass roots needs of their society and can call on the rest of the   church to help in the areas where help is most needed.\nPut together, all these efforts are helping to inculcate a spirit of sharing.   As an example, it has becoming increasingly unacceptable in the AFM to have   a congregation with a hefty bank balance, while only a kilometre away from there   is a church in which the pastor does not know where the next meal will come   from. The AFM's social welfare department is working fullsteam - in addition   to it's other activities, on the question of empowerment and even job creation.\nWe have self-help schemes but are spending more on schemes that will help people   help themselves. Some of our congregations have started Kibbutz-like operations   where jobless people and down and outs are taught skills they could apply to   earn a living on return to society. We have drug rehabilitation centres, orphanages,   old age homes and other schemes.\nOnto another avenue, we believe that much of what had gone askew in the past   was the result of churches not having observed the fine dividing line between   church and State. Many believers were adamant for instance, that the terrain   of politics was not for christians and yet the church - the one institution   which no government can destroy, meekly followed.\nTo combat this, we are today encouraging our people to take part in their society,   in politics, in what is going on around them. With the aid of expert communications   opinion we now employ, we have come to the belief or be it belatedly, that the   church had in the past been on tow often because it was ill informed. Today   we have heeded communications advice that the more our people are involved in   their own environments, the better they will be informed.\nThrough spreading that information to their fellow christians, congregations   and congregants, we be able to take better decisions - decisions taking only   after multi-inputs. We have no fear of our people going astray, provided they   remain true to their christian beliefs and in this way they will be able to   develop higher moral and ethical values. A spin-off of this we believe, will   help to combat evils such as the current crime waves spearheaded by violence   and dishonesty.\nIf our prayers are fulfilled, we believe the more peaceable country that will   result from this will attract investment which in turn will lead to job creation   and a more stable society. We have to admit that we in the past neglected our   duty of ministering to those in high office, this led to them ministering their   ideology to us and we all know the consequences.\nWe are confident that as more and more of our people take their rightful place   in society - even government, doors will be increasingly open for us to do our   spiritual duty in promoting good and Godly government into inspiring those who   watch over us, to display qualities that will turn this world into a better   place for all.\nWhereas before the AFM was blinded to so many aspects we today know we should   have been critical of. As we interface with society, as we teach our people   and above all, as we make social justice and upliftment pillars in our strategy,   the AFM today is becoming a force for healing and nation building.\nI thank you Commissioners, for hearing us today and I pray that God will bless   you and your work, may he guide your noble endeavours and in drawing up your   report which we are confident will benefit our entire beloved nation.

What happens here today and that happened during this week in the Apostolic   Faith Mission, is a clear testimony that the vertical dimension of reconciliation   also spilt over in our hearts and therefore we are able. And I want to say this   today publicly, that the AFM has reached more than a structural unity, I believe   God has melted our hearts together and that we become one reconciled. \nIn fact, being reconciled with God compels us to be reconciled with one another.   I have something on my heart that I want to do and that is not on the programme   and I say honestly I feel this is from God. I want to ask Father Frank Chikane   just to come and stand with me. \nPastor Frank, - and I want to address especially my brothers and sisters from   the previous composite division of the Apostolic Faith Mission, I have never   before - as in the last week or two, really realised how much you've suffered   and how much pain and frustration and despair you experienced in decades of   separation. \nI've listened to you my brother Frank, the last week a number of times in discussions   not only about what you yourself have suffered, not only physically but spiritually   and emotionally because of the vision in our church.

            "Thank you very much Sir. \nI think the submission of the United Reformed Church needs to be placed in   a context for it to be correctly understood. This church is quite young, established   out of the amalgamation of the Dutch Reformed Mission Church and Dutch Reformed   Church in Africa in 1994.\nThe history of the former churches being churches established because of racial   reasons, separated at the communion from the White Dutch Reformed Church in   1881. From 1881 right up to 1994, four racially divided churches existed, named   the Dutch Reformed Mission Church, the Dutch Reformed Church in Africa, the   Reformed Church in Africa for so-called Indians and the NG Kerk or Dutch Reformed   Church for Whites.\nWe ourselves even having been set of this church as daughter churches, have   always - in the sense in terms of our identity, been accused of being in cahoots   with the White church and in many cases not much distinction was made between   the Mission Church, the NG Kerk in Afrika, the Reformed Church and the Dutch   Reformed Church. The history was intertwined for different reasons. On the one   hand you had the influence of a specially dominant leadership of the missionaries   within these churches, the whole question of the dependency of these churches   on the White church and it's impact on it's theological training within these   churches.\nIf I should leave the rest of the history and come to the idea of our unification   in 1994. We understood the ideal ...[indistinct] by these churches and especially   in this sense that the former Dutch Reformed Church in Africa and Mission Church   and our own actions in amalgamating the two churches, as being our own departing   from our divided and racial history. And this departure Sir, represents to our   understanding, our contradiction of the idea of racially divided churches.\nThe church consists of about 483.000 confessing members and 683 congregations   nationally. In our own submission we would like to clarify a few points, the   one being that we understand that speaking to the TRC and making submissions   on the question of violation of human rights, of our participation thereof,   support thereof or the extent to which we were victims of it, comes from both   a social as well as a church context.\nThe popular slogan of the '80's \"The Church - The Sight of Struggle\",   is relevant in this regard. Historical and contemporary self understanding of   the church, I think was portrayed in this slogan. ...[indistinct] as one of   the institutions in society that did not remain unaffected but the all encompassing   influence of apartheid. The slogan led to the realisation that the same contradictions   that are prevalent in society are present and often reflected in the teaching   and life of the church.\nAnd in the sense, our submission reflects a church context representing both   the struggle within and the struggle of the church outwardly. We understand   that speaking to the questions of the violation of human rights, it concerns   both those violations by ourselves or our members as well as violations committed   against our members or collectively. In this regard we listed in our written   submission, various areas where these matters were raised.\nIf I morally without going into each of those, we in summary say that we believe   that the United Reformed Church - even in it's existence as the former Mission   Church and Dutch Reformed Church in Africa, did not do enough in opposing apartheid.   It did not do enough in speaking clearly against the evils of apartheid. It   did not do enough - in terms of our own programmes and actions, to enable and   incite our members to actively oppose and struggle against the evils of apartheid   in the extent to which this very policy was the cause and the main motivation   behind many of the human rights violations - as has been heard by this Commission   in the past couple of months.\nI therefore continue on to one of the areas I do think we need to highlight    the whole question of the apartheid war and the chaplancy service - it's on   page 8 of our submission. Security forces in this country - the police and army,   were mainly responsible for both offensive and defensive actions, in defence   of apartheid and against the onslaught of terrorism, communism and ant-Christ.   In the cause of this war and the development of the total strategy - total onslaught   strategy, the Government initiated the whole idea of winning the hearts and   the minds of the people.\nSome of the organs being used in winning hearts and minds was amongst others   - for instance, the christian cultural organisations. Following on this was   the low intensity war with all it's covert actions, the result of which - I   think, we have heard quite a lot of evidence and submissions before the TRC,   but basically the apartheid government relied very strongly on the moral and   spiritual undergirding as a means of enabling the forces to carry out their   acts in defence of this crime against humanity.\nThe chaplancy services of both the police and army became - to our understanding,   the means of attaining this ideal and so we had the whole holy war concept that   became operative. Although individual members of the synods of the former churches   opposed the idea of participation in the chaplancy services, the church continued   to avail ministers for this service and through this act the church participated   in this holy war and even blessed it.\nIt did not resist, neither did it guide it's members in opposing it. Thus the   church contributed to gross human rights violation, polarisation and the indescribable   suffering and grief many people suffered. Precariously we also need to acknowledge   that the very presence of the members of our churches in these services - in   actual fact, was our own guilt - a part of it, in these violations.\nI'd like to go onto section 5 Sir, speaking to the issue of the failure of   these churches to live up to our principles of faith. This Uniting Reformed   Church does not claim sole responsibility for the insights we have for what   is normative in both the questions of faith, morals, ethics, etc. The Uniting   Reformed Church is rooted in the reformed tradition. This tradition boasts the   fact that scripture alone is normative for teaching and living. \nIn Jesus Christ, God confirmed the dignity of human kind. Through Christ's   life, death and resurrection, God reconciled human kind with himself and each   other by breaking down the walls of divisions, destroying ...[indistinct] and   establishing peace. Further defined, this church strongly relied on the calvarous   doctrine on Church/State relationships. This doctrine clearly teaches the responsibility   of the church as an institution and it's individual members.\nCalvary teaches that God through Jesus Christ, reigns supreme. Within this   theological perspective, the State is a servant of God to the benefit of it's   subjects. The State is burdened with the responsibility to restrict ...[indistinct],   restrain chaos and fight evil and in this sense, the State is servant of God.   To enable the State in it's task, it is invested with the sword as a means of   effective or effecting authority of it's calling - according to Romans XIII.\nIn contrast, the State that diverts from this calling is described as the beast   that acts in contravention of it's mandate. Kelvin, in view of his understanding   of scripture, was convinced that resistance against the unjust States and tyranny   is not only justified ...[indistinct] true faith and obligation. The failure   to denounce, resist and incite to resist against apartheid and it's resulting   violation of human rights, constitutes our failure, failure to live up to our   faith's convictions.\nRather, the church often got involved in debates on the legitimacy and right   of resistance against authority. These debates were often dominated by the question   of violence and armed struggle and this furthermore happened under circumstances   in which ...[End of tape 3]\n... the failure of the structure of the church to give the necessary support   for youth suffering, other members did so in their personal capacity. For this   they deserve recognition and honour. Therefore having acknowledged this, the   United Reformed church wishes to use this opportunity in view of acts or commission   or omission, to consequently oppose human rights' violations in view of its   subtle recognition of the illegitimate apartheid regime's liaison, (indistinct)   and negotiations. In view of its silence and conscious and unconscious lack   of clarity in word and deed, we confess unreservedly (indistinct) its members'   guilt. \nWe herewith plead for forgiveness of opposed citizens and the Supreme God.   I wish to however on this very note indicate that the nature of our confession   before this house is not one defined purely for the sake of appearing before   the TRC.\nIn our own struggling with our identity in 1982, and having had the status   (indistinct) and the adoption of the confession (indistinct), this very church   in 1982 in looking at itself and how it functioned in this society said along   with many others, we confess our guilt that we have not always witnessed clearly   enough in our situation and so are jointly responsible for the way in which   those things which were experienced as sin, and confessed to be so, or should   have been experienced as and confessed to be sin, have grown in time so seem   self evidently right and to be ideologies foreign to scripture.\nThis confession sir, you find in the accompanying letter, paragraph 1 to the   confession on (indistinct) So we wish to say that even though in the last few   days and even in the last times, you may have heard people and churches come   before, seemingly the one after the other confessing sin and seeking forgiveness,   we would truly hope that this occasion would never denigrate what happened in   sense of the confession and we wish to say that in the same sense, in the urgency   in which we for ourselves in 1982 defined our own confession of guilt in a sense,   that today just becomes a continuation and logical consequence of it.\nIf I may go on to the matter of decisions and actions with regards or in resistance   of human rights' violations, once again if I could shortly just highlight the   context of the church. When we speak of our own actions and decisions, we never   claim to be the only church who has had certain insights, certain commitments.   We understand that the context which exist, was one in which we shared communally   with other people.\nSo for instance, some of the main moments for this church in terms of becoming   clear on certain matters, are represented in the matters before you, the attack   by the Minister Schlebush in 1979 against the SACC with regards to civil disobedience   and the resulting letter of Dr Allan Boesak to the Minister.\nThe confession of Belhar as stated and the vice-Chairperson will later make   some comment on this. The document and its own and clear witness that one cannot   reconcile good and evil, one cannot reconcile God and Satan.\nThe church clearly need to be involved in activities that would transform,   liberate society as part of God's mission.\nI said earlier on our own failure to remain true to our calling, was the main   cause for the struggle within the church itself. In this sense certain moments   needed to be highlighted without going into detail.\nOne being for instance the Christian institute, its own actions and confessions.   The extent to which it sought to enable people to clearly understand and act   in the society.\nThe confessing circle within the framework of the former Dutch Reformed Mission   Church and Dutch Reformed Church in Africa and what it stood for, (indistinct)   and many others, that is the context from which our own understanding grew.\nSpeaking of the struggle of this church itself, I wish to say that for quite   a period one did not see clear decisions in the minutes of Synod, neither actions   that would to some extent indicate this church's struggle against apartheid.\nWe however, recognise that this very same period right up to the beginning   of the 1960's was one in terms of my earlier reference, where a very strong   dominance of Dutch Reformed Church missionaries functioning in these churches,   and it is only since 1961 in the case of the former mission church and 1963   in the case of the former Dutch Reformed Church in Africa, that one has seen   the up come of indigenous leaders in the church and so greater clarity within   the church's teaching and actions.\nYou have a list before you of some of the issues dealt with by the church.   The members of the former church primarily as students, on a student level,   were at the centre of historical events at that time. They took the lead at   many campuses and schools. I mention a few with regards to the University of   the Western Cape and other institutions.\n(Indistinct) youth and student revolt resulted in expulsions and detentions,   going into exile. The conviction and imprisonment of members of this church,   disruption of academic careers as well as the deaths of others as I referred   to earlier on.\nDuring the 1988 Synod the church declared that this policy of irreconcilability   leads to polarisation and conflicts and this conflicts was then used by both   government and in many church circles as an alibi to maintain the separation   of people at all costs.\nDecisions of this church itself, contributed to decisions made at the World   Alliance of Reformed Churches in 1982 when the question of apartheid was clearly   stated not to be only a practical or political matter, but a question of fait   and therefore the declaration of the status (indistinct) in 1982. This led to   the adoption of the confession of Belhar to which my brother will also shortly   refer.\nI think maybe I should just pass on to the question of our own contribution   in the question of reconciliation. In a very short reference to the confession   of Belhar, this church has in the past two years in the strategic planning,   has taken on as its vision the whole idea of unity, reconciliation and justice.\nNot only in the sense in which it was confessed in 1982 and 1986, but in terms   of our own grabbling on how this church can make contributions in the renewal   as well as reconciliation in this country.\nI just shortly list a few points we have mentioned in this document with regards   to the idea of pastoral counselling of victims, (indistinct), the confession   of guilt, service of the church in forgiveness and reconciliation, the sense   in which a church could be able in continuing acts of reconciliation bring people   to public reconciliation, (indistinct) of reconciliation (indistinct) and transforming   worship into acts of reconciliation.\nReconciliation services for local, regional and national groups, (indistinct)   of rehabilitation programmes holistically seeking the renewal of perpetrators.\nWe believe that the religious community can contribute to a profound religious   or theological statements and the erection of some memorial in remembrance to   the martyrs and the victims of human rights' abuses.\nBut one point I think we would like to emphasise comes under what we think   could happen nationally, that is within this country of ours, for the sake of   reconciliation but also for the sake of accountability, that there should be   a presentation of a report of a civil audit and social comments on the part   or the progress in and the promotion of human rights by the authorities, followed   by a policy declaration or manifesto, the declaration of intent by the State   itself.\nWe know that there are many organs functioning in a sense as watchdogs of what   happens, but I believe that the whole idea of holding government accountable   in view of our history, could be one of the means in which we would ensure that   what happened in the past, will never again happen in the future.\nI thank you sir.",

            "Thank you. It is an honour and a privilege for me to openly say   in affirming what my Moderator has said in short. I wish I was speaking at a   time where we are not a Uniting Reformed Church but a United Reformed Church   with our fellow Dutch Reformed Church.\nWe are guilty both of the same type of sin. We have sinned against the nation,   we have misrepresented God's word in whatever we did. From the Uniting Reformed   Church I must simply say we have been throughout the time, been a testing ground   of any legislation from the National Party parliament.\nOne example as a young student in the church, at training college, on a Sunday   an honourable Minister of Religion came to offer holy communion and baptism   and he decided not to do that, but tried to explain to us the new coming legislation   over the separate development.\nChildren were not baptised on that day, holy communion was not served on that   day but a clear picture was put to us of the benefits that we would get from   separate development. I looked upon those present and I knew nobody could question   that and it went on, he explained at the end, he offered another time to come   and give holy communion and serve holy communion.\nThe important issue was to use the time to introduce the separate development   into the country. We had been total guinea pigs of our mother, to say to the   world that you are the only church that understands. If chaplains were needed   for the Police and the Defence, it will only come mostly largely, almost 90   percent from the ranks of the United Reformed Church, for both Defence and the   Police, but we are aware that we as a church had never had peace within ourselves,   within ourselves, within our mother and those were sent by the mother to help   us. There has been an undiminishing intensity of war within us.\nThat is the bedroom war, which ended up with the births of the Belhar confession   where we say up to here can no more longer. A status confession has to be declared   in which we say any difference on this question of apartheid, can never be reconciled   with the Word of God.\nNow, we want to say our church as a testing ground served the National Party   with many informers. People outside, they know some of the things that we do   not know, that some of our ministers were used to serve the interest and we   want to openly this afternoon confess to the nation that we have sinned against   you. We knew the truth and we avoided to live with the truth.\nSome of the things that are not known to us, that our members were involved   in, are those things that we want to say to the nation, may God grant us grace.   His grace is immeasurable, it can never be measured by a human being. He loves   us and we want to say as my Moderator said create a conducive atmosphere for   reparations and for the better way forward.\nWe have sinned against the nation, and we confess of our sins, thank you sir.",

            "Mr Chairperson, I wanted to start in English but only to say   thank you for the invitation and that we can take part in this hearings of the   faith communities and we truly believe that this will strengthen the essential   process of reconciliation between faith communities and I believe thereafter   also in a broader community.\nBut then Mr Chairperson it is written in Psalm 45 that the tongue can run smoothly   and so thank you for the opportunity that I can do it in the language in which   my tongue runs the most smoothly, in Afrikaans.\nMr Chairman, we as members of the Dutch Reformed Church form part of the people   of South Africa. We were born here and we wish to stay here to participate in   this wonderful beloved country of ours.\nWe have been here for more than three and a half centuries, we are part of   this history. We are regarded as the greater portion of the negative of this   history, but on this day we wish to come and to commit ourselves on this day   to playing a positive role in reconciliation in this country.\nI believe we can say that our people have positively assimilated the change   in government in South Africa and that we are set to contribute constructively   in this country to a place to create a place of freedom, justice and human dignity   for everybody.\nWe also wish to come here before you and say that we think differently about   ourselves, that we wish to play our role in the shape of a servant according   to the example set by our Lord.\nWe also wish particularly to strive more than ever before to comply with and   obey the commandment of neighbourly love towards all our peoples. We say today   that we have a calling to promote redemption and that it means that we wish   to continue to listen to the stories of other people, that we really wish to   go to great lengths to see their pain and need and that we wish to cooperate   in the healing of the community and the solution of problems.\nTherefore we are called on this day to say that we admit to our own weaknesses,   but to also say that we have been called unconditionally to accept and forgive   other people.\nAnd now we know that we as a church wish to cooperate meaningfully towards   reconciliation in this country, we have to start with ourselves. Therefore we   have to do everything in our power, to have the process of church unification   progress in our own midst. You heard that the previous group said they wished   that we were a united church and we wish to state from our side, the same today.\nWe are also wishing that we have progressed further along this road. The actions   of our church are determined to a great extend by Synod decisions and we have   to say that very clearly stated decisions have been taken by our Synod, but   we know that these words have to be translated into actions increasingly today.\nA question which will definitely be asked today is whether I am speaking, I   am able to speak on behalf of the whole Dutch Reformed Church. No, I cannot,   just like other people, I have to admit that there are two groups in our church.\nI believe that if I speak about reconciliation here today, with regard to the   wrong which we committed, I am speaking on behalf of the greater portion of   this church. A group which is increasing daily.\nI would like to summarise our role in reconciliation in two words, reformation.   We are a reformed church which means that we wish to be open to the Lord to   change us through His Word. We also wish to be so in these times but there is   also a new word, that is currently enjoying status and that is transformation,   something which we also wish to implement in our structure so that we can become   increasingly a reformed church.\nThe second matter we will refer to is that we wish to do this together with   other churches. It is not something that we can do alone. It is only recently   that we started thinking together and planning together with other churches   and we wish to state our need here today that we are here to learn from other   churches to hear what they are saying, to take the hands that have been reached   us to assist us as well.\nWe also with to recognise today and admit that there are other faiths in this   country, and although it is difficult for us as a church to worship with other   faiths, we would like to admit that on the basis of common goals for reconciliation,   we wish to cooperate and are prepared to cooperate without coming to the point   of comparing spiritual points of view or saying who is wrong and who is right.\nMr Chairman, if I refer to the practical implications of reconciliation, I   would like to start with the building of people.\nReconciliation is always a personal thing and here the gospel has to enjoy   precedence. There is a need of spiritual equipment among our people and also   certainly among other people.\nWith regard to human dignity, fellow humanity, common humanity and neighbourly   love, we wish to assist our people and also other people where necessary to   learn values such as acceptance, patience, respect, honesty, diligence, etc.\nWe wish to afford every person an equal opportunity to take a place in this   society of ours and therefore in addition to literacy programmes, we also wish   to implement programmes which are already in place, to teach people skills.\nDuring the Synod of 1994, we gave recognition to the RDP programme and we stated   that the church wished to link up with that as far as possible and practical.   We recognise the large extent and scope of poverty. We are also concerned about   that portion of our society whose situation has not shown any marked change.   The church knows that it cannot just preach reconciliation, but that here it   also has to go into action so that basic requirements for life are provided   for everybody.\nFrom the norms of our church, we wish to continue to contribute our share through   equal payment for equal work and to strive for just wages. Without expanding   too much on what is being done, we wish to say that we are thankful that our   social services in this respect, have been expanded into the other communities.\nI wish to continue with my fourth point and state that without contact among   persons, there cannot be reconciliation. Therefore these programmes will also   have to enjoy precedence on the road ahead, so that there will be spiritual   contact between people so that they will be able to hear each other and thus   also to establish and strengthen the essential mutual trust amongst people.\nOur daily management has also been discussing a day of reconciliation which   we would like to discuss with other groupings as well. I would like to refer   to the future and the past as well.\nIt is impossible to build a solid future without having honestly dispenses   with the past. Similarly the unique problems of the present times, such as violence,   corruption, lawlessness and meaningless murders of innocents, cannot be overcome   if the past and the future is not fairly judged.\nIt can therefore be expected and must be expected of the DRC to speak honestly   about the past if its inputs are to be acceptable. It should also open the door   to us for forgiveness and mutual acceptance.\nI therefore wish to testify to the struggle that the DRC had to wage within   itself in order to reject apartheid and to do away with apartheid in its decisions.   In 1982 the Synod rejected apartheid as sin, to reject racism as sin.\nThe Dutch Reformed Church stands by its admission in 1986 that the church had   erred seriously with the Biblical foundation of the forced segregation of people.   In 1990 it confessed that the DRC should have rejected this point of view much   sooner than it actually had n the occasion of the Rustenburg conference of churches   where Willie Jonker declared our personal guilt and responsibility for the political,   social, economic and structural injustices in this country.\nHere in this meeting today I can also just say that we wish to support these   decisions and prove that they are true by our attitude of working at reconciliation   and also by listening to what other churches tell us regarding the past.\nIn 1994 the General Synod gave credit to members, officials and church gatherings   who have voiced a clear descent against apartheid in the past. You would have   read about our fellow brothers, like Dr Beyers Naude who had been accepted among   us.\nThe church also admitted that in this struggle of its doing away with apartheid   and rejecting apartheid, it also entered into discussions and meetings with   brothers and sisters of the Dutch Reformed Church family as a broader family.\t\nThen just to complete the picture, we also would like to refer to the persistent   statement of this point of view which from time to time gave rise to a loss   of members and officials from our church. We experienced that people left us   because of this.\nI can also testify to a spirit of reconciliation which has developed in many   of our congregations in these days and which is still ongoing. Honest efforts   have been made through confession to close the past and to step into a new future.\nThe most poignant of these took place at the GCOWE consultation in Pretoria   where 180 ministers and members of the Dutch Reformed Church at the end of the   meeting, made a written public confession. In this confession statement was   made with regard to wrongful attitudes and deeds of the past and they also committed   themselves to working with other churches towards redemption, unity and justice.\nThe movement for reconciliation is growing in our church on ground level. The   church also continually and with empathy focused on the large numbers of people   who were unjustly disadvantaged during the times of apartheid and to assist   them in their poverty and suffering.\nA lack of understanding, unwillingness and disobedience among members and officials   with regard to the need in the community, were also admitted and confessed to   before God.\nThe Dutch Reformed Church apologises to these people and admits that its voice   of protest had not been loud enough and to prove and admit that what had been   done was not adequate.\nIt is said that one must have a dream. One of our members, Johan Heyns' dream   was that the church should use less water during christenings, and rather used   the water to build homes. Therefore this church also has a dream. It is a dream   of a country where people will accept each other and where every human being   will also make a contribution to peaceful co-existence.\nAs a church we wish to be guided in this regard by the Word of God which says   try to be at peace with everyone.

It reminds me of the days when you came with your church to become an   observer in the SACC when things were tough and with others you did pave your   way and I remember it was a day of celebration when we received you in the SACC   as an observer church.\nThank you very much for your input. The history of your church has been a painful   one indeed. But I must say that it has not been very different from other churches.   Some of the experiences which you experienced in your Dutch Reformed Church,   are the experiences which have been felt even in the English speaking churches.\nI think that needs to be clear. What I want to ask here, miracles do happen.   You have seen when we met with the Apostolic Faith Mission, the church which   was affected as your church has been affected, do you think that there is any   way or do you feel motivated by what you have seen from that church where confessions   were made publicly between the household of that church and then reconciliation   had also to be processed within that church in public so that the church can   be one, even before they can try to move out to promote reconciliation in the   outer world?\nI say this because of the testimonies which were made here by some of the people   who came out of the mother church. They came out very bruised and hurt, because   of what happened there.\nYou as the mother church maybe you need to take a very big initiative to see   that confession may be and asking for forgiveness from those churches as the   mother church can take place. Do you feel that you are able to do that as the   Dutch Reformed Church, to address this which has been mentioned here by the   Belydende Kring, I don't know how to pronounce the Afrikaans words, and also   the United Reformed Church this morning?\nYou are speaking about the people who were very hurt on the way, thus covering   the great mission of your church in this country, thank you.",

That which had appeared before you, was   the pain and the sadness from the heart primarily of one group of people. In   that regard, they might well have felt that it was not fair or equitable although   from my side, of course I know that the injustice was one sided.\nThat is the only way in which I can explain the situation. People might have   felt, Afrikaans people, that that which had come from the old order was considered   to be entirely wrong and that was all pushed to the side. I must say to you   that there are a large group of people who do not want to accept the work of   this Commission, and who do have a negative attitude towards the Commission.\nBut I do believe that the voices of those who would say that as believers and   as a church we have responsibility to make a contribution wherever reconciliation   occurs, that would be the case, and that is why in our church we continue again   and again to ask. It is my view that this Commission had been given and our   denomination prays for the Commission.\nWe do not pray that the Commission must fail, we pray that your work and what   I have seen in the past two days and which I appreciate very much, that we pray   that God will bless this. Certainly a large number of our people do not accept   your work, but there is a group who pray that your work also as individuals   will be blessed.",

If you teach them that this is the way of the Bible, in fact you instruct them   how they should act, and in this regard certainly the church has confessed that   it is guilty and we are experiencing an inner struggle to change around and   turn around in this regard.\nWhen a person appears before you, applying for amnesty, it is indeed true that   he can say that this gospel was taught to him in this way.\nCertainly there had been different messages sent at a later stage, but people   can certainly make this claim. Whether we would want to do something with these   people, alongside these people in their process, most of these people prefer   personal accompaniment and pastoral ministry from their ministers, there have   been no request for a larger process brought to us, but I hear what you say   and we could certainly consider such a process.\nUp until now, these people had been individually accompanied by their ministers   in their local congregations in a pastoral sense.",

            "I wanted to say that we have deep appreciation for all that you   have said. It is certainly difficult for any one of us to confess something   and to ask for forgiveness.\nTo be able to do so is only possible because of the grace of God. Grace which   God so voluminously pours out on us. You have personally spoken of your many   efforts with regard to the relationship of your denomination towards this Commission   and how you would have liked to have made a presentation from your denomination.\nFor that reason we are very grateful that you have indeed decided only just   now recently, that you indeed as a church would be represented and that you   would represent your church.\nI want to give thanks to God because as you say, what has been happening here,   has truly been wonderful and we can all just, all we can really say is thank   you to God that God has led so many to doing that which we all find so very   difficult to do, especially when we have to do it in public.\nYour church has a tremendous role to play, it has had an important role in   the life of this country from the beginning. It has had a very significant impact   on the lives of very, very many and I have no doubt at all, that God is intending   to use your church powerfully for this nation.\nI have sometimes, one of the wonderful things about Afrikaners particularly,   is that they are not subtle. That might sound as if I am not praising you, but   what I mean is that unlike other people, the Afrikaner is one who once they   see the light, have no half measures. \nWhen you are committed, you are committed to the hilt whatever the cost, and   we saw it with the many people that you referred to whom for quite a while your   church has ostracised and you church did a wonderful thing in 1994 because there   are not very many churches that have publicly until recently, publicly said   we erred. Beyers Naude and all of you others who were prophets, we are sorry   for what we have done publicly and I think we need to acknowledge that.\nAgain the grace of God is wonderful and that you responded to the grace of   God on that occasion and that now the prophets who have sidelined, have been   welcomed back into your community. I am saying they are an example of people   who once they have seen the light, as it were, take the bit between their teeth   and you have a problem reigning them in.\nAnd if I may say so humbly, I am so glad that you have seen the light and we   know we could almost say to the devil watch out, here comes the Dutch Reformed   Church.\nBut I am sort of half (indistinct), but I think I mean to have you as it were,   on our side, is a tremendous thing and we give thanks to God. There is a lot   of healing to be done, there are many horrible things that have happened and   we are glad that you are part of the process of healing in this land.\nSomeone said to me perhaps today, one of the things we should do is perhaps   just to keep a moment's silence and remembering many people, but to pray in   thanksgiving for people like Johan Heyns, but what this person was saying was   they wished we could pray that God would bless the Police to find the people   who did what they did to Prof Johan Heyns.\nPerhaps I must ask you after a moment's silence, to offer a prayer in the broad   under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.",

            "First of all I would like to apologise for Dr Beyers Naude, he   is at the moment in Holland and he would have liked to have been here this afternoon,   but unfortunately he couldn't.\nAnd I would also like to apologise for Dr Nico Botha and Dr Tinjiko Maluleke,   they phoned to say that they are in the midst of the exams at UNISA and it is   impossible for them to come. I am very thankful that brother Moss Nthla is here,   he is one of the fellow compilers of the letter, and he would also like to say   something about the letter.\nChairperson, before I read the open letter, I would just like by way of introduction,   to say something about the origin of this letter.\nIt was after the previous night when a certain Brigadier made a statement to   the Truth Commission in which inter alia he revealed how Dr Fabian Ribeiro and   his wife were assassinated. It touched me very, very deeply not because of this   Brigadier's witness but because of the very sad reality of our country.\nDr Ribeiro and his wife were our neighbours in Mamelodi, a very beloved medical   practitioner in that community and the afternoon when they were killed, five   o'clock in the afternoon, they called me and said come immediately and here   were those two people, dead.\nI said my God, but it cannot be possible, who did this? The next week a pamphlet   was distributed by the South African Defence Force saying this was the work   of ANC terrorists because they are communists, they want to implement a revolution   and they know how beloved these two people were and therefore that is the way   they do it.\nAnd then a few months ago this Brigadier said that two assassinators were hired   to kill them. The next morning in our tea room at UNISA I spoke to my colleagues   and I said how is it possible, we were all pastors of churches, preaching every   Sunday and in many of our congregations, members of the government were present   Sunday after Sunday.\nMany of these willing executioners of this government were members of our congregations,   and in other churches. What happened, how must we explain it? Didn't we understand   the gospel properly, didn't we preach the full gospel, didn't we know? No, we   knew. We had to admit first of all that we had failed to spell out the consequences   of the gospel of Jesus Christ and therefore we didn't touch the conscience either   of the members of the government or the willing executioners of their plans.\nWe were also afraid, we had to admit, we were afraid. I was afraid many a time   when they wanted to put me into jail. Sadly enough that we had to admit that   because the earliest history of the Christian church or the pastors of the Christian   church, the apostles, especially Paul, they were not afraid of jail. They went   from one jail to another but we were unfaithful to the gospel because of our   fear and we had to admit that.\nAnd we said, well, what can we do about it? And we said, well all that we can   do is to admit and to confess and say we didn't do our work properly. We have   failed the gospel and we have failed the Lord of the church.\nBut when I got back in my office, I thought well, that is an easy way to get   off it. I started to draft a letter and I thought churches may issue statements   of confession, church leaders may say many things, but the real people who must   say what they feel about what happened in our country, are the pastors.\nThe pastors of all the different congregations, they had the responsibility   to speak to the hearts and the conscience of the people in our land. So all   the pastors have failed and I therefore drafted an open letter to pastors of   all churches in South Africa and I took it to Beyers Naude and I said Beyers,   please read this letter and tell me what you think about it.\nHe read it and said I will sign it. I am willing to sign it. Also I could have   done more, also I failed. And then we called together four other colleagues   and we sat down and then moulded the draft into a final document which I will   submit to you and that is how this letter came into existence.\nChairperson, I would therefore like to start to read this letter, it is not   a long letter, it is only one and a half pages.\nAn open letter to all pastors in South Africa. To us as preachers of the Word   of God, the responsibility is entrusted to proclaim at all times, the gospel   of reconciliation with God and our fellow human beings in Christ.\nThis responsibility entails the prophetic denouncement of all forms of injustice,   oppression and violence committed against any human being. As we read and hear   what happened in South Africa during the years of Nationalist Party rule we   as preachers of God's Word, are confronted with the question how could it possibly   have happened while we as preachers of reconciliation, justice and peace were   preaching this message from our pulpit every Sunday?\nBut the question which disturbs us even more is this, how was it possible that   those who intentionally committed murders and sabotage against fellow citizens,   could have been as is now becoming evident, members of churches and even regular   churchgoers?\nWas there nothing in our preaching, litigious and sacraments that disturbed   the conscience of those who were directly involved in all the evil deeds committed?\nTherefore we have indeed more than enough reason to feel deeply guilty for   having spiritualised and even gagged the gospel to such an extent that those   in government and those responsible to execute government policy, didn't feel   confronted by our preaching.\nWe are guilty of having allowed the rulers to execute the ideology of forced   separation for the sake of so-called law and order without offering united resistance   as preachers of justice and peace.\nWe admit and confess that we too were blinded by an ideology which presented   itself as justifiable from the Bible.\nWe lacked the gift of discerning the spirits because we had not real desire   to receive this gift. In the light of the above, we want to confess publicly   that we as preachers were co-responsible for what happened in South Africa.   In fact our guilt should be considered as more serious than that of any other   person or institution.\nWe who were supposed to be the conscience of the nation, didn't succeed in   preventing the most serious forms of abuse of the human conscience. As a result   of this, the criminal violation of people's human dignity and even the destruction   of human life, continued for too long.\nBut this confession of guilt is not intended to be vague and general. We confess   our guilt by mentioning specific examples of our failure to be faithful to the   gospel. We first of all acknowledge and confess that for many of us, especially   those in the white community, life was very convenient and comfortable under   Nationalist Party rule.\nMany of us therefore couldn't and wouldn't see the oppression and violation   of millions of people in our country, hear their cries for justice and failed   to take action.\nWe furthermore acknowledge and confess that when we sometimes did feel uncomfortable   about the way the government and other institutions persisted in its abuse of   power, we did nothing because of fear.\nWe thereby allowed evil with the cooperation of Christians, to continue its   devastating work against the people of God.\nIn the same breath we commit ourselves to call upon Christians to be careful   in their support of political leaders and their policies. We furthermore commit   ourselves to challenge Christians concerning their political and socio-economic   responsibilities.\nWe also want to make amends for neglecting the needs of the poor and the oppressed,   therefore we commit ourselves to the task of guiding God's people towards involvement   in actions to eliminate the socio-economic inequalities of our country.\nWe have evaded this responsibility for too long. We furthermore commit ourselves   to the task of encouraging people with the gospel of hope. Especially in these   days when many have lost hope and are despairing of the future of our country.\nThis we will do by replacing the longing for the previous so-called better   days, by dreams of an even better future. The same gospel therefore, also urges   us to commit ourselves to engage in the reconstruction of our society.\nAlthough we recognise that some ministers have stood bravely in the struggle   for justice, it is our hope that every church minister who reads this document,   will recognise the challenge facing us all, which we dare not push aside.\nWe are compelled to make a choice. Either we confess our guilt in order to   be set free for greater and more faithful service to the gospel of Jesus Christ,   or we ignore this challenge to confess our guilt and thus declare ourselves   not guilty of what happened in our country.\nIf you are willing to identify with this document and commit yourself to a   process of unified action and a process of healing and rebuilding our nation,   send your reply before the end of 1997 to the following address.\nThis document with the signatures will be submitted to the TRC and we express   the hope that it would serve as a unified response from ministers. We hereby   also wish to extend this invitation to spiritual leaders of other religions   to participate in the submission.\nThereafter a national conference of all those who have signed this document,   will be arranged in order to discuss the implications of our confession.\nChairperson, after we decided on this final document, Beyers Naude and I offered   that we will send this letter to as many pastors as possible and we started   to collect all the names and addresses of as many as we could get hold of.\nNow, we were saying to one another, if only we could get a 100 pastors to identify   with this letter, we will perhaps feel like an Abraham in the Old Testament   to start bargaining with God and say well, there are at least 100.\nThe good news is that we received 396 signatures and just before I came to   the table, Dr Don Degrushi from the Congregational Church asked me to add his   name, so there is at least righteous person in the Congregational Church, because   we didn't receive any other.\nThe bad news is that we have sent out on our own account 12 000 letters to   pastors. 12 000 letters, we received back 51 undelivered, address unknown. We   received in total 605 responses to the letter, 396 signatures and the other   290 responses.\nHonourable Chairperson, I am sad to say I couldn't believe that any Christian   could write such letters as we have received, some of them. Even less I can   believe that any pastor in this world could put something like that on paper   and send it to us.\nIt is therefore that I would like to say something about the reaction of the   pastors to this letter, but let me, may I then just first read from whom we   received signatures saying we identify with this letter, from pastors from the   different churches.\nFrom the Apostolic Faith Mission, seven pastors. Africa Enterprise, one. Church   of the Province of Southern Africa Anglican, 50. Arbeidsbediening Interkerklik,   1. Baptist, 6. Baptist Convention 1. Baptist Union, 3. Church of the Nazareer,   4. Dutch Reformed Church, to my own surprise, 88, one of the highest. Evangelical   Lutheran, 7. Evangelical Presbyterian Church in South Africa, 1. International   Fellowship of Christian Churches, 1. Helderberg Christian Fellowship, 1. Jubilee   Community Church, 5. Laudium Community Church, 1. Lutheran Church, 3. Methodist   Church, the highest of all, 97. Morawian, 1. New Life in Christ Fellowship Centre,   1. Nuwe Hoop Gemeente, 1. Presbyterian Church of South Africa, 17. Rhema Ministries   in South Africa, 1. Roman Catholic Church, 28. Volle Evangelie Kerk van God   in Suid-Afrika, 1. United Congregational Church of South Africa, 3 and yours   is then 4. Four righteous pastors. Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa,   that is the two brothers who were here this afternoon, 56 of the pastors. Vineyard   Church, 1. World Wide Church of God, 1. And then some pastors overseas who read   about the letter and sent their names, there were 8 of them.\nNow, Chairperson, 12 000 letters and the letters were also published fully   in the Afrikaans and English newspapers. So I can't believe that any minister   can say I didn't know about this letter.\nThe question I would like to put to the church leaders who were submitting   their confessions here, what is happening in the churches? Are the pastors not   interested? Don't they care? I can't believe that the pastors will still consider   me and Beyers Naude as communists, rebels, trouble makers or whatever it may   be.\nOr do they just look at it and say no, I am not interested in a thing like   this. Why out of 12 000 letters only 396? It is saddening to thing that that   is the reality about the church at grassroots level.\nAnd if pastors are not willing to make a confession, how on God's earth can   they ever expect that the members must do so?\nAnd therefore in conclusion, I would like to mention three things. First of   all, in spite of all the good things we have heard during the past three days,   and I am thankful I didn't intend to be here for three days, but it so happened   that I had to be here and in spite of all the good things that I have heard,   I would like to call upon all these church leaders to go back to the drawing   board in the light of this letter, the response to this letter, and to do their   homework. Are they convinced that what they have said here, is the conviction   of the pastors in their church?\nI would very humbly suggest that all the leaders who made submissions will   send their documents to every local congregation and say please read this to   the congregation, and if possible you as a pastor, sign it so that we as the   leaders of the church may know that this is not only the conviction of the few   leaders, but the conviction of every pastor in our church. That is the one thing.\nA second thing I would like to put on the table is, I would once again, I have   done it so many times already, and I want to do it once again, before I do this,   can I just add, I have read again through the Rustenburg Conference decisions   we have taken.\nHonourable Chairman, Rustenburg was a wonderful conference, but not much crystallised   out of it. If you read those beautiful decisions we had taken, very few if any   were really implemented.\nIs this going to be a second Rustenburg Conference? Many decisions by church   leaders, no implementation? I put it to the church leaders.\nThe second thing, I would once again as I have said I have done it before so   often, call upon the leaders of the Dutch Reformed Church in God's name to leave,   to free themselves from the bondage of the Afrikaner Broederbond.\nI can't see how there can ever be real reconciliation with the black churches   of the Dutch Reformed Church family as long as those churches know that the   leaders of the Dutch Reformed Church belong to the Afrikaner Broederbond which   after 1994 put on a new jacket and called themselves Afrikanerbond, it is still   the same thing.\nIt is still a secret organisation, you are still not allowed to have a look   into their documents as strange as it may be. You are still not allowed, and   many pastors of the Dutch Reformed Church - I was a member of the Afrikaner   Broederbond for 10 years. In my time 60 percent of the Dutch Reformed Ministers   belonged to the Afrikaner Broederbond, and I believe that it will perhaps still   be the same.\nWhy must the Dutch Reformed Church burden herself with this albatross around   her neck? Wouldn't they, the leaders be willing to free themselves from that   bondage and call upon all pastors of the Dutch Reformed Church to say let's   get out of it.\nAnd the third thing I would like to put on the table, yes and before I put   the third one, I would just like to mention that just before I came to this   commission, I received a very painful letter from a young Dutch Reformed Minister   whose life was ruined recently by fellow Dutch Reformed Ministers whom he knew   are members of the Broederbond.\nAnd he said for God's sake, just mention it to the Truth Commission, and that   is why I feel that I have an obligation to put this on the table.\nAnd thirdly, yes, I would like to identify myself and say let the executioner   of the assassination on Johan Heyns come forward. Let us hear why, who commissioned   him? Why did they decide that he must be killed?\nPerhaps the Truth Commission can put it officially and say let the person who   gave the command or the person who executed the assassination, let him come   forward. It can even be behind closed doors, but I think it is a shame on our   country that something like that could happen and that they tell us it is impossible   to find the one who did it.\nThose are the three things I would like to put. I thank you for the time. I   don't think I have used 20 minutes. My colleague, I know that he would also   like to say something, two minutes you say.",

            "We first want to express our sincere and greatest gratitude   for this opportunity, Your Grace, Mr Chairman, especially for the two Afrikaners   who are very ashamed of your own past and also what we are submitting here,   is in great humility.\nWe are not theologians as indicated on your programme, we are neither ministers,   but we are ordinary lecturers at University of Potchefstroom. We are also members   of the Reformed Church of South Africa and we are therefore here in our individual   capacities and not officially representing either our church or the institution   where we work.\nWe therefore cannot speak on behalf of either the church or the university   and I must say we are sad that our own church is missing the opportunity of   this occasion where we have learnt a lot and which have encouraged us to continue   on the way ahead.\nI will briefly answer on the three questions you have posed and the first one   is to what extent have you suffered? Your Grace, the answer is simple. We did   not suffer. At least if we compare it with the real sufferings of our black   countrymen. We had ordinary check ups by the Security Police, we were ridiculed   and rejected by our own people on many occasions, we were mentally tortured,   but never physically.\nWe also by participating in apartheid, did damage to ourselves, because we   benefitted from the system and we were not willing to sacrifice our careers   in deliberating taking the side of the oppressed people. And for all these reasons   and many more, we made a public confession of our guilt, of which you have a   copy and more copies are available also in English translation.\nMay I read only a small part in the original Afrikaans. Confession of guilt.   We hereby confess before God and our neighbour that we failed in word and in   action in church and society, privately and publicly to testify adequately and   unambiguously against the embodiment and execution of the ideology of apartheid   which had an invidious and even ruinous effect on the lives of so many of our   fellow believers and fellow citizens.\nWe confess that we were not courageous enough to testify that we did not pray   faithfully enough, did not believe actively enough, did not love vehemently   enough and did not have enough empathy in the context of individual and social   injustices in which our country was plunged for four decades and more.\nWe acknowledge in great humility that we were guilty of the violation of fundamental   human rights and we acknowledge that we had a share in the directionless movement   of our country, during times of crisis.\nWe confess that we are deeply guilty in the sight of God and we seek forgiveness   from God and the redemptive sacrifice of Jesus Christ, but we also plead for   forgiveness from our deprived and wronged fellow believers and fellow citizens   for what we did to them.\nFrom our side we undertake as far as is humanly possible, to make amends in   word and action for the damage which we did to them through the unfair discriminatory   system. It is only this small portion that I wish to read, I will continue in   English.\nMay I add Your Grace, that in spite of the fact that only four people drew   up this document of repentance, that we were not the only voices crying in the   wilderness. We received many phone calls, letters and personal conversations   and also in the press, positive reactions from people who said that they would   like to sign this document, both from the Reformed Church of South Africa as   well as from staff of the Potchefstroom University.\nOn the other hand, we must also say that we noticed a stubborn resistance of   people simply ignoring us by keeping silent. This brings me to the second question,   what have you done to oppose apartheid.\nWe were privileged at the Potchefstroom University in our education also overseas,   that we were not educated in a narrow minded church view of the world and of   society, but that we were educated in a Christian world view which indicated   that as Christians, we had a calling to serve God in all areas of life.\nOf course this makes us even more guilty that we have done so little in the   past. An important part of this perspective was a Christian social analysis,   you can call it Christian footwear and Christian clothing to appear in public   and not only pyjamas for your personal life of faith or a Sunday suit.\nAnd of course a Christian world view can easily derail and finally become an   oppressive ideology, but from this perspective and from a Christian philosophy,   we tried to open the eyes and the perceptions, change the perceptions of especially   the white people in our church and also at the university and as far as possible,   also outside our university.\nI mention a few examples. The periodical Word and Action, Word and Deed, already   criticised apartheid from the early 1970's. The publication in 1977 of the Koinonia   declaration which had an international impact, and then all the publications   of the Institute for Reformational Studies on socio-political issues as well   as its comments on important documents like the Kairos document, Church and   Society.\nBut what I would like to mention especially is our conferences where we try   to get together people from all walks of life and all the different population   groups in South Africa to discuss together issues of relevance for the whole   country.\nI had experience that during time of racial isolation, this encouraged people   tremendously to continue in the struggle and at our conferences we also challenge   the Potchefstroom University, we reprimanded it in our resolutions because of   its stance, its policy about the admission as well as accommodation policies   towards black students.\nIn all these ways, we tried to open the eyes of church leaders, lecturers,   students and people blinded by the apartheid ideology and I must confess opening   our own eyes more and more for the damage done by this ideology.\nThis brings me to a last point, what kind of expertise can we contribute in   the future? I think there are three levels, personal, institutional and national.\nMe and my family have done a few small things. I am not going to mention that.   On the institutional level I only want to mention that we are involved in a   variety of ways trying to transform the university and perhaps the Reformed   Church of South Africa.\nI think Professor Venter can mention more examples. I only want in conclusion   to mention one thing on a national level.\nI think we should pay even more attention than in the past to the whole issue   which this whole meeting concentrated on, and that is what is the correct, what   is the correct relationship between religion and society including of course   political, economic and cultural and educational aspects.\nYou may say I am becoming to academic now, but I think we need clear thinking   to have correct actions. Let me mention three things. The first thing, I think   even during this meeting it was quite clear that the following question needs   further study and clarification.\nAbout this relationship between religion and society, on the one hand, we cannot   identify religion and politics, then you get the unholy alliance again which   we had in the past between church and State.\nOn the other hand again, we cannot separate religion and society, then you   get a so-called a-political Christianity of which we also have examples at this   conference because religion is something total, it is something integral, you   cannot separate the two.\nThe question then is what is the correct relationship. Ideas about an independent   prophetic role has been mentioned here. I think it is not enough. I think and   that is only one suggestion, that we have to work out a comprehensive philosophy   of society in which we concretise God's central love commandment so that we   can see that justice is the form of love we need in political life.\nThere is not a clash between justice and love, that stewardship is the central   norm in our economic life and what the implications thereof is, fidelity in   marriage, etc, etc.\nSecond example, many Christians think that religion can only have a beneficial   influence on society, more or less automatic positive influence. I think it   has also become abundantly clear during this whole meeting that this is not   the fact. Religion can play a double role. It can also simply legitimise an   unjust status quo,it can act as opium because religion is a fallible human response   to God. How can we therefore in future, and that is the question, enhance the   inspiring, motivating positive impact of religion whilst neutralising it negative   consequences. In other words, put very straightforwardly, how can we become   more self critical?\nAnd then lastly, and here I am including myself. Many beautiful promises have   been made during this whole meeting of what people envisage to be doing in the   future. My question is shouldn't it be monitored?\nI think we need a kind of feedback in a few years from now. This may be one   of the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee and because   this Committee will no longer be in existence any more, I do hope that the religious   communities will take the initiative.\nThank you Mr Chairman, my time is up and I hand over to Professor Venter.",

            "It is Chairperson, in itself a significant fact that we are here   without mandate or institutional support.\nThe specific reformed Afrikaner community from which we come, and who were   part of that privileged group who used the opportunity given to us by God, to   lead this country used that opportunity for selfishness and extremely atrocious   forms of oppression, still does not seem ready to confess its leading share   in what has happened.\nI am struggling with the question whether this indicates that the community   such as that wants to continue in some way with the practices and attitudes   of the past. I have asked myself many times, forgive me my intellectual style   of doing, that is what I have been trained to and what I do every day, how it   came that the Afrikaner and especially those in the tradition in which I am,   went down the road of the ideology of apartheid.\nAnd I see something in the history of the Afrikaner going back to a philosophy   of Jan Jacques Rossouw, who though espousing consensus democracy, elevated the   State into the position of God. Rossouw wanted to encompass all civil institutions   in the aims of the State, even prescribe a civil religion and interestingly   the only crime for which he explicitly prescribes the death penalty, is that   you deny any tannate of the civil religion.\nSeems to me and it is also clear from Rossouw's work that he went back to the   ancient model of the Greek and Roman City States, where the State were God and   Socrates dies for having doubted the gods of the State and the charge sheet   brought before Pontius Pilot about one Jesus of Nazareth, said he says he is   the King of the Jews, which of course relativised he pretended divinity of the   Roman Emperor.\nConservative Christians often defend their complicity with an unjust state   for their own advantage, using Romans 13 where Christians are commanded to obey   the government. Too easily it is forgotten that Romans 13 provides no opportunity   for any Christian less a fair policy. It does induce Christians to accept even   an unbelieving government as the servant of God for justice which means amongst   others, that Christians are not to take the law into their own hands.\nAt the same time it relativises the Roman Emperor and his pretended divinity   to the position of a servant for justice no less, but no more.\nAs an Afrikaner striving to be a responsible Christian citizen, I felt liberated   on election day, 1994. For the first time in decades that I had the vote, my   vote counted for me alone. And I did not have to carry the unbearable burden   of voting for millions of other people who had neither vote nor voice.\nThe arrival of democracy however, spells liberation but not salvation. Democracy   in itself will not save us from a repetition of the oppressions of the past.   Jan Jacques Rossouw's model of the State was eminently democratic, yet he substituted   patriotic State education for parental education, he wanted to control public   opinion, prescribed a civil religion and proposed full control of the economy.\nIt was a modernised version of the ancient god States. It is also not for nothing   that he rejected Christianity as his civil religion, because he was afraid that   people who believe you must love God, your neighbour and your enemy, may just   be ambiguous citizens who would not kneel and adore the State finally and might   just at some stage or other, come up for justice.\nDemocracy serves as one of the best instruments to call the State to book about   justice, but it is not the only one. A very important instrument for this is   exactly what Rossouw did not want, independent, non-political institutions,   churches, universities, media which are critical and point to that higher norm   which the State is supposed to serve, the norm of justice.\nThis is what brought us together here, our failure as religious people. My   failure as a Christian citizen, my failure as a member of the Reformed Church,   the failure of Christian institutions in this country to which I and we belong,   to call the previous regime to book exactly on the obedience on that, on the   question of obedience to that higher norm.\nDemocracy I say in itself will not save us. Hitler came to power through democracy.   Pending on how one defines democracy, the apartheid State presented itself as   a democracy of the Rossouw kind, a Volks democracy, Afrikaner churches, Afrikaner   schools, Afrikaner universities in the days of the Reddingsdaadbond, even Afrikaner   rugby.\nThe Afrikaner volk was identified with the Afrikaner State and the State encompassed   all the other civil institutions. Afrikaners idealised their volk as embodied   in the State.\nThus the Afrikaner churches, universities and other institutions acted as no   more than limbs, the hands, the feet, the brain of the volk and the State.\nAfrikaner churches married couples or refused to according to the unjustibles   of the State. It remained silent when the black members who worked, paid taxes   and obeyed the law, were denied their civil rights. They even justified this   denial theologically. \nIt did not protest while blacks were living and working in such circumstances   that family life collapsed. It sanctioned white greed through the theological   justification of apartheid and remained silent mostly about its atrocious execution.\nLet me just mention two examples of wilful cooperation between church and State.   Young men who had just completed their studies for the ministry were conscripted   into military service, in the chaplaincy services and there were references   to that already during the past three days.\nIn spite of Reformed Church law, which places every minister under supervision   of a local church council, almost nothing if anything was done, to protect these   young men from the pressures of the total onslaught ideology espoused by their   officers. The church did nothing to protect the few of them who dared to ask   critical questions and landed themselves in serious trouble.\nThe second example, a few people in Potchefstroom following up on the national   initiative for reconciliation in the 1980's and I suffer from a little bit of   premature (indistinct), I cannot remember exactly when in the 1980's and I ask   the Archbishop who was involved, but he couldn't help me either.\nThose people in Potchefstroom started an initiative to provide study space   for black matriculants in the afternoons during the unrest of the 1980's. They   requested to use church halls and church buildings from Afrikaans churches in   town. Direct communication from the Security Forces and I was a member of one   such church council, there was a member of the Security Forces as an elder there,   who came up with this story, branded this action as communist inspired because   the national initiative for reconciliation, that was the origin of it and of   course those were aligned to the communists, and no church council in Potchefstroom   was prepared and I am referring to all three of the major Afrikaans churches,   was prepared to supply such space.\nThe ideological blindness was so strong that the elders and ministers totally   overlooked the fact that a black matriculant who did use this opportunity, was   in fact jeopardising the short term aims of the struggle, how this could be   communist inspired, I cannot figure out.\nPleading that we did not know about the atrocities being committed, is simply   not valid. Enough persons were supposed to have jumped out of a window at John   Vorster Square or died in some other strange ways, for us to have had to ask   ourselves the question about the Police methods of interrogation and to have   concluded that Steve Biko was not the only one ever to have been killed in Police   custody.\nAnd we surely knew what powers had been conferred by the Security legislation   and the state of emergency on young men of 18 and 19 years old indoctrinated   to see citizens calling for dignified treatment, as their enemies.\nWe took young men, we gave them guns and we instituted a state of emergency   so we made them judges. They could apply the death penalty and they could execute   it and they could do so in split second or in 30 seconds, on the spot. That   is what the state of emergency implied, they could shoot.\nWe knew that if we did not know the details of what happened inside, either   by silence or explicit support, reformed Afrikaner people acted in complicity   with the State. Both academics and ministers who spoke out were few and far   between.\nPhilosophically and theologically we in the reformed tradition, have no excuse   either. We have a clear and good tradition of social criticism, based on two   principles. All societal institutions are equally subject to God's law and societal   institutions should guard their independence conscientiously so as to fulfil   their own particular tasks and to witness prophetical to all of society about   that law.\nOur cosy relationship with the apartheid State went against our very reformed   understanding of society. I am a member of the Reformed Churches who finally   decided to denounce apartheid as a sin and its theological justification as   a heresy but then, did it systematically start to oppose this sin and heresy   amongst its own members, was any member ever reprimanded, any theologian called   to book for voting for this policy or providing biblical support for this doctrine?\nAs far as I know, the answer is no. The sinner decided not to confess at least,   not here before the TRC. This makes Prof Meiring's question how to get the Afrikaans   churches on board the reconciliation process, very acute.\nIn part the problem lies in our discourse. In a sense we allow them to be separate   by using the discourse of separation. There are in fact no Afrikaans or Afrikaner   churches, all of them have black members too.\nGetting reformed Afrikaners on board the reconciliation process, can be the   product of a loving confrontation by their own black members. What does this   all mean for the future?\nFirstly without a real confession which shows a change of heart, we have a   credibility problem. We want to do our civil duty whatever valid critical contributions   we can make, will be read in terms of the sins of our past.\nIt is possible since the apartheid State touched on every aspect of life, it   was a totalitarian State that presently we feel seduced into intervening from   the side of the present democratic State into every aspect of life so as to   transform it, which may if we are not careful, bring us back to the position   of a State which intervenes in every aspect of life, but we can only tackle   this problem at least from the side of the reformed Afrikaners if we have come   clean on having done the same sin.\nOne reformed colleague, a theologian has criticised us for confessing and I   am not referring to him in order to answer him directly, but in order to point   to an attitude. He was calling this confession which my colleague Bennie van   der Walt read, referring to old cows. Most of you know the Afrikaans expression   \"ou koeie uit die sloot grawe\". If an old cow falls into the trench,   well, then let her stay in the mud and die there, why dig her up?\nHe wants us rather to tackle the present government, focusing on corruption,   incompetence and crime. I shiver at these expressions. It is an insult to the   bereaved families, those murdered in atrocious ways, those who became the objects   of suspicion and even necklacing. It is also an insult to bereaved parents,   wives, who lost husbands and sons in military service, not knowing where and   how, while we as Afrikaners were pretending to practise a foreign policy of   non-intervention and non-interference in our neighbours' affairs.\nOur critics wants us to attack the government for crime, corruption, incompetence   otherwise he says we shall have to confess again very soon in the future. I   fear he is both wrong and right. \nHe is wrong in since the past is very much still with us in its consequences   and alive. There is no such thing as old cows in the trench. And also wrong   about having to confess in future, since we already have to confess that we   are failing and are insensitive about getting to grips with the present consequences   of the past.\nThe past is very much alive in the demographic distribution of our church members   and its geographical delineation of congregations.\nThe extremely poor are still hidden in the township congregations, while the   deacons who do have the means to support them, are concentrated in the white   congregations.\nI have not yet seen any theological rethinking, also not by our colleague,   who is a theologian, I am not of the office of deacon in a multi-cultural geographically   divided society although cultural prejudice is at the very heart of the institution   of the office of deaconship in the New Testament.\nFamily life has been destructed by the conditions of life under apartheid.   The destruction of (indistinct) of morality is part of our present crime and   greed problem. The Apostle Paul recognised the independence of family life when   he encouraged Christian wives not to divorce their pagan husbands. All of us   have to help emancipate family life as a healthy form of social life, not to   be swallowed up by church or State.\nWe have to support it and not just break it up, even if we don't like polygamy   from the side of womens' rights, we cannot just tell polygamist's wife to divorce.\nI have seen and signed petitions against our liberal abortion laws but our   responsibility for family planning, does not end with petitioning the government.   How about the churches putting their deeds where their words are, providing   shelters and or schooling for pregnant women who might otherwise consider abortion   as the only option?\nWe are critical, so am I when government interferes with parental controls   over their children's education. But thousands of teachers are out of their   jobs. Why do we, Christians not hire some of those teachers to teach our children?\nIf private Christian schools at a fair cost ever had a chance of success, they   do now. By taking the responsibility for the education of our children upon   ourselves, those who have the means, the government does not only save on school   places for the poorest of poor, but also costly control mechanisms.\nPart of our divisions of the past came from the way in which Afrikaners tried   to protect their cultural heritage. Is exclusivity the only way because we are   struggling in some institutions with this? Isn't it time to swop the roles and   protect not our own cultural heritage, but that of others and thus create goodwill   for our own?\nWe cry that socialism works nowhere when government intervenes in economic   life for the sake of affirmative action and I am nearly finished, Your Grace.\nIt is a well-known fact that even in hi-tech Japan the bulk of employment comes   from small and mini businesses. Where are the Christian businessmen who will   train mini entrepreneurs, help them to tools and contract them into their manufacturing   line, so that they have a market for their products.\nOne last remark, government totalitarianism is not the only god, social god   on the horizon. Late capitalist competitive totalitarianism is already wreaking   havoc in our country. We tend to, we seem to say well if the government cannot   do it, then the market can and will, competition will care for us.\nWe are too happy atheist socialism failed, so competitive totalism must then   be the Christian answer. The economy gains investment, the GMP grows, yet unemployment   grows too. Suicide amongst young people is on the increase. Selfishness, corruption   and greed crimes abound.\nYet, we blindly serve the capitalist god. A new kind of elitism develops. Those   that can afford sophisticated technology are well off, the rest are without   merit and not competitive enough.\nIt covers a new racism, poverty and being left behind in the market go together   and more or less overlap with the racial divide.\nWe see no resistance or even analysis of this brutal philosophy from Christians   yet, I hope that we will soon see it come.\nThank you Honourable Commissioners for having listened to us. We represent   nobody accept that which we believe in.",

Thank you very much, you may step down.\nJust before we close, I want again to express our deep appreciation to all   of those who made submissions to the TRC and those of you who have taken the   trouble to come and responded to our invitation to appear at this hearing.\nWe are grateful for the audiences that we have had over these three days. We   thank pastor Chris Venter and the people, let me repeat that, we are enormously   grateful to them for having provided us with a venue for the service on Sunday   and made available this venue for our meeting.\nThank you to the translators sitting behind the booth there, they have been   wonderful. We are enormously grateful to you for your own particular ministry.   Maybe we should give you a small hand I think. And thank you to the technicians,   you have acquired a substantial presence inside here and we wouldn't be able   to manage without you. Maybe we will give you a hand too.\nThank you to the people who have been the caterers, they have done a wonderful   job of work, we thank them.

You have been marvellous.   We are enormously grateful to you. If you don't clap for them, then I will -   I wanted also to say thank you to the media who have helped to communicate what   has been taking place here. \nI want to come back to that just in a little while but I want to remind people   that December, the 14th is the date when we stop receiving statements from people   who believe they have suffered violations, gross violations of their human rights.   It is important and if you will please communicate this message to people that   access to reparation can happen only because you have filled our protocol form,   the TRC protocol form. \nIf you have not done so, you have still got some time, nearly a month but as   it happens, I think December the 14th, is a Sunday, so in fact you have only   up to December the 12th, Friday.\nIf you will please spread this as widely as you can because we want, we don't   want anyone who might have a legitimate cause to be eligible for reparation,   to miss out on that reparation because they did not fill or provide us with   a statement on our protocol form.\nI just wanted to say again that the media have been usually very splendid in   helping to communicate the work of the TRC, but especially we would hope that   they will have honed their skills in order to communicate what has taken place   here over these three days because it has been something quite extraordinary.\nI am quite certain that if people out there were aware of the movement of God's   spirit here, the attitude of the different faith communities and the different   denominations, if they were aware of just how people have humbled themselves   before the Lord, and received an influx of the Spirit, the things that we are   talking about of people being hostile towards the Commission, opposing the Commission,   those people might perhaps have a change in their attitude and in their mindset.\nBut those of you who have been here, might also be apostles. Go out and tell   what the Lord has done here because it is ultimately really as people hear that   this thing. It has never been a witch hunt, especially not a witch hunt against   the Afrikaner, but it has never been a witch hunt against anybody.\nIt is an organisation, a body that has sought to discover the truth not in   order to prosecute anybody. To discover the truth so that we might make a contribution   towards the healing of our land, to discover the truth so that we might be able   to say this we commit ourselves, is something we will never allow to happen   again.\nSo, thank you very much all of you and we thank God.
