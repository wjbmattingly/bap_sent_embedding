As I have mentioned before that the ANC have sown it's own police within the KwaZulu Police, they had people who they would use as their contact, who worked in disguise.  They were people whom we used to chat and laugh with and we were not able to find out about their involvement.  It so happened that we discovered what was happening.  Khumalo was one of those policemen who would take particulars or information and supply it to the ANC.  However, the main reason why he had to be killed was because of the dockets he stole and took them to the ANC leadership.  Those were serious documents, because they were relating to our work - our syndicate or hit squad.  They were dockets involving the death or covering the death of ANC people.  So he tried to steal them and he gave them to certain members or leaders of the African National Congress.  I would like to lie before the committee to say how we found out that Khumalo was involved - was doing what I have explained.  However, it must be remembered that we had a structure called BSI.  In",

I remember one day, while I was with Romeo at Ulundi we decided to disagree - we disagreed about Khumalo's issue because we didn't believe that he could do such things.  He was a trusted person and we trusted him and he acted as if he was an Inkatha member.  There were no signs which could alert us that he could do such bad things.  However, we ended up confirming that it was possible that he could do such things or he did such things, because Khumalo had whispered or told in secret to Captain Masinga, who was the man in command of the CIDs and Romeo was attached to the CIDs.  He was an investigator under M A Masinga.  Masinga told Romeo on a certain day that he should be careful, \"Romeo you should be careful.  Khumalo has told me that you must wait.  The big fish are going to be arrested.  There are big fishes who are going to fill up the prisons and included you, Romeo, among those big fishes\", and that frightened us a lot, in such a way that Romeo had to come to me, because I wasn't there.

People were divided in such a way that you have to ascertain whether you were drinking with your people from your own side or you are travelling with people in buses from your own side or not, so you have to be careful.  So that's how the place was divided, and also the sections were divided.  This made it easy for the ANC to know that if they attack J2 section, even the cat that is going to be killed belongs to Inkatha, and we also knew that if you attack a particular place - for example, there was a place called Emakhlandeleni, you wouldn't find any person belonging to any particular group except the ANC members.

We got to Lindelani and his wife told us that we left him at Nongoma.  He was not at home and we passed through Hammarsdale.  From Hammarsdale we left in the evening and we went to Pietermaritzburg and we came back late that night and we drove back to Ulundi.  We reported to Captain Langeni that we failed to get to Tshabalala or find Tshabalala.  Langeni promised that he would trace him.  After that there had been some cases at Esikhaweni where firearms were found at Mrs Mbuyazi and we have to come to Durban during a week-end with Mrs Mbuyazi and we have to go back to Ulundi.",

With all due respect, it's not fair.  It's not fair in the sense that this Commission must make a decision that will affect the history of the country.  You are trying to - and I mean I've got very great respect for what you're trying to achieve, to reconcile the people, to establish the truth, everything, but we are sitting in a predicament.  For a week or two we are going to hear evidence from one side.  You are not going to hear any evidence from us.  You can't hear complete cross-examination from our side.

It's only a suggestion I can make.  I don't know how many of the Commissioners have read, say, for instance, Judge Hugo's judgment or studied all the documents, but it's necessary because we've heard Mr Varney's evidence on that point.  He virtually wrote a doctor's thesis on the whole subject.  Then we've the got - the whole question of training was discussed, evidence was led by General Groenewald, about a day or two, I think, by General Oelschig, approximately a day or two by General Liebenberg, by General Geldenhuys, where all these things have been dealt with.",
