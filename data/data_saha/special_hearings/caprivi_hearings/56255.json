He asked to be excused from today's proceedings because of urgent matters that have arisen, which he did not anticipate when he agreed to represent the two person.  He will be available tomorrow and he requests that any cross-examination or further evidence from his clients stand over to tomorrow.  Secondly, Dr Williams would have been available for cross-examination at 10 o'clock this morning.  His flight has been delayed.  He will be arriving during the course of the morning and I would therefore ask that his further evidence stand down until he is available and can be slotted in at a convenient stage.  That would leave us then with only three witnesses - Mr Mkhize, who has already given evidence-in-chief, but whose cross-examination stood over last week.  Mr Romeo Mbambo has not given evidence at all, but his evidence relates purely to the Esikhaweni activities.  He himself has not trained in the Caprivi at any stage.  And then Superintendent Marion from the South African Police, who would merely give statistical evidence which is relevant to the hearing.  Mr Mkhize and Mr Mbambo are both represented by Mr Wills, and he made a request that Mr Mkhize's cross-examination be finalised before Mr Mbambo testifies.  Unless there's any objection to that suggestion, I'm inclined at this stage to call Mr Mkhize for further cross-examination.\n/\nCHAIRMAN\n1A",

Now that headman, induna, was influencing people not to respect the chief, because the chief is an IFP member.

I'd say that first of all if one was actually dealing with conventional operations, then the environment is pretty straightforward, the armed forces are there for the protection of the sovereignty of the government in question, whether they engage themselves externally or internally.  When it comes to Coin Ops, the tendency is counter insurgency operations.  The tendency is for it to become much more blurred.  In terms of classic counter insurgency theory, whether it's rural or urban, the military forces that one utilises and whatever counter mobilisation measures one adopts, is there to ensure the integrity of the sovereignty and legitimacy of the government of the day.  Where it does appear to be blurred in this case, is firstly the fact that these forces were used in support of a particular political party, which undermines the supposedly non-partisan and apolitical role which armed forces should play.

I think the second point which you raised is the question of command and control, because one must bear in mind at the end of the day that this was a very volatile climate within military forces were being employed.  There were also other forces available and I think that the one was mentioned earlier on by the legal counsel there, that could have played the role of protection.  It could have been 121 Battalion, it could have been the police, it could have been the standard SADF citizen force unit, but a necessity was felt to create a force over and above that and that is why I have stressed one has to look at the political and military objectives of this force in relationship to those other agencies one had at one's disposal, before one can actually can - can really comment on it, so I would say it's very difficult - certainly the principles of counter revolution, counter insurgency warfare perpetually argue for unity of effort for the legitimacy of the operation and creating a force in which the command and control is shaky and vague at best, does become problematic, particularly when it is in support of a partisan objective.",

Once you've reached that stage you could - and that would probably more accurately describe the scenario in Northern Namibia in the mid eighties onwards, where you had large amounts of insurgents coming in, hitting bases, hitting villages.  To my knowledge that was not the situation in KwaZulu-Natal, there were limited rural skirmishes.  There's a high level of political presence and organisation within the urban areas, but even militarily, your urban operations there were largely, as far as I can recall, limited to special operations type of attacks, armed propaganda.",

So many people were injured in that operation, but after we had done, we went to Mrs Mbuyazi, we found Mrs Mbuyazi and Chief Mathaba waiting for us and they asked us as to what kind of weapons we used and guns and we told them that we used the normal guns and they said, the way they sounded, they sounded so unique and they were so happy and the mood was",

He was heading the Investigation Task Unit at that time and I told Madlanduna at that time that we have taken a decision that we want to tell the truth as it is.  That's when Madlanduna told us that it is fine, we are at liberty to tell the truth as it was, because the Caprivians were disturbed about our arrest and had a meeting with Madlanduna and wrote a letter to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi that they were requesting to see him so that they could discuss our matter and Chief Buthelezi promised that he will attend the meeting, but to no avail and he ended up saying he gave a letter from the Caprivians, written by him, gave to his driver, Mr Dumakude and he did not know what Dumakude did with the letter.

We submit and we will submit in our\n /oral submissions\n4A oral submissions that practically what we should deal with is the evidence that was given and not documentary - documents which were placed before you by people such as Mr Varney, from which he attempted to draw various inferences.  So we will confine ourselves to the evidence he actually gave and other witnesses gave.  In that sense, Mr Chairman, we do not anticipate being very long, but what I would say, Mr Chairman, again from a procedural point of view and from a fairness point of view, I would suggest that Mr Stewart and Mr Wills should go first with their submissions, so that we can obviate the necessity of having replies and replies to replies, etcetera, because clearly what we will be dealing with would be issues raised on the evidence by Mr Wills and Mr Stewart, so it seems to me, Mr Chairman.  So I would submit that, in fairness, procedurally it would be correct for them to present their oral submissions, if any, first.  I am sorry, yes, I've just been reminded.
