<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>they are doing their job well and the country has to know what is actually </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>going on and they are doing that, they are telling the country what is going on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>and they are doing it well.  Good luck to all of you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   When is the election!!  (Laughter)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>MR VLOK:   No I am finished.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>MR VLOK IS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>DR BORAINE:   Mr Wessels do you wish to take the oath or the affirmation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>MR WESSELS:   The affirmation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>LEON WESSELS:   (affirms)</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>MR WESSELS:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman we come from </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>different backgrounds and we come from different launching pads.  I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>listened to the witnesses that have appeared before you since yesterday </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>morning.  The document I had prepared I had made available to your staff </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>yesterday morning because I knew given the evidence that you were about to </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>receive I would be tempted to change it.  I have not changed my document, </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>this is how I felt yesterday and I stand by my statement and you will just have </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>to bear with me, I hope, as I present it to you now.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a> May I further say that I had, listening to Mr Botha and Mr Vlok </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>yesterday, I had the privilege of working with both of them for three and a </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>half years, 18 months with Mr Vlok, which was a privilege, two years with Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>Botha, which was also a privilege and my colleague right next to me and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>have seen many sunsets and many sunrises in battle, and I am pleased to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>associated with him from this position.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a> I, however, will say what I have to say off my own bat and I don't hold </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>any of them accountable for what I am saying.  I say that for my own account.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>I do remember, Mr Chairman, Abraham Tiro.  Many years ago I took a </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>resolution never to forget his tragic death.  In life he introduced me to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>realities of South Africa.  In his death his memory never allowed me to forget </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>the tragedies of South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a> I remember Mr Chairman the first time we met.  You were kind enough </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>to make mention of an area that we share, those were the days of isolating </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>Botha in his laager, making this country ungovernable.  We are not afraid to </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>inherit a wasteland.  Those were the days of states of emergency, emergency </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>regulations and the steps taken under those regulations that we thought were </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>necessary to save life and property.  I remember saying to you then, during </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>that encounter Mr Chairman, that the political climate was such at the time </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>that many people would not understand the fact that we were even speaking to </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>each other.  To the government and National Party establishment you were a </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>sanctions activist and a political trouble-maker.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a> I proudly remember, Sir, that I was appointed to this position, and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>take it it was because of this position that I am here today, by Mr Botha as </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>Deputy Minister of Law and Order.  I think kindly of him and believe that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>deserves credit for major initiatives.  Those were the days of the Homburg </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>hats, I hated that, but I loved my work.  I remember Sir, proud soldiers and </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>policemen now on their knees in front of the Amnesty Committee, I cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>condone those violent unlawful acts, but nor can I condemn the persons.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>cannot disown them.  We were on the same side and fought for the same cause, </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>namely law and order as we saw it, and also to ensure that this country would </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>not be made ungovernable.  Power was not be wrested from us in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>revolutionary manner.  I cannot disown any of those men and women who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>on our side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a> I do not believe that individually or collectively I ever took a decision </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>that cannot stand the test of daylight here today.  Every decision was taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>within the ambit of the law as it was known then.  The law may be criticised </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>today and I will certainly agree and concede that that law will not stand the </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>test of constitutional scrutiny at this juncture.  However, that was the law of </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>the land.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a> I further do not believe that the political defence of I did not know.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>want to delete the WE and I want to delete the US.  I said I speak of my own </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>bat.  I further do not believe that the political defence of I did not know is </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>available to me, because in many respects I believe I did not want to know.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>am afraid I am deleting and amending that sentence to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a> In my own way I had my suspicions of things that had caused </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>discomfort in official circles, but because I did not have the facts to </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>substantiate my suspicions or I had lacked the courage to shout from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>rooftops, I have to confess that I only whispered in the corridors.  That I </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>believe is the accusation that people may level at many of us.  That US is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>deleted.  We simply did not, and I did not confront the reports of injustices </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>head-on.  It may be blunt but I have to say it.  Since the days of the Biko </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>tragedy right up to the days of hostel activities, hostel atrocities in the late, </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>late eighties, as we went up to the record of understanding the National Party </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>did not have an inquisitive mindset.  The National Party did not have an </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>enquiring mind about these matters.  We have to applaud, and we have to give </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>credit to Mr F W de Klerk for the actions he had taken to appoint the Harms </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>Commission and to appoint the Goldstone Commission.  I simply believe that </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>it is a pity that there is not a collective political and moral acceptance of </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>responsibility forthcoming from the quarters from which I emanate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a> It became clear from evidence before the Truth and Reconciliation </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>Commission that even sharply probing judges had been wilfully misled in </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>many cases by key security forces personnel.  Not surprisingly some </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>individuals had done the same to gullible politicians not excessively keen to </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>ask pointed questions.  Eugene de Kock's recent claim in his amnesty bid I </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>submit is correct, namely, that any National Party politician or supporter, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>may add, at the time who believed that we held power because of persuasion </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>and not through coercion was out of touch of reality to put it mildly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a> With the benefit of hindsight I now believe that we had failed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>security forces because we did not offer this country a viable constitutional </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>vision to end the conflict.  And secondly, that the relationship between the </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>security forces and the National Party politicians, as a collective, in general, </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>was not an open transparent one, and therefore we did not manage the security </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>forces Intelligence services properly.  If we had managed them properly you </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>would not have had to listen to evidence on the one hand they, believing that </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>they acted with authority, us telling you that we did not grant the authority </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>which they believed that they had had.  But that has been the subject of a long </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>debate and will continue to be debated in front of your Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a> The observation made by the Commonwealth group of Eminent Persons </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>in their report on page 65 dated the 7th of June 1986, I repeat </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>June 1986, I submit is correct.  "We are left with the impression </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>of a divided government, yet even the more enlightened </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>Ministers whom we met seemed to be out of touch with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>mood in the black townships.  The rising tide of anger and </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>impatience within them and the extent of black mobilisation and </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>so of course are the great generality of white South Africans, </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>only some ten percent of whom we were told have ever seen </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>conditions in a township.  Put in the simple way the blacks have </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>had enough of apartheid.  They are no longer prepared to submit </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>to its oppression, discrimination and exploitation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a> They can no longer stomach being treated as aliens in their own </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>country.  They have confidence, not merely in the justice of </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>their cause but in the inevitability of their victory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a> Unlike the earlier periods of unrest and government attempts to </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>stamp out protests there has been during the last 18 months no </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>outflow of black refugees from South Africa.  The strength of </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>black convictions is now matched by a readiness to die for those </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>convictions.  They will therefore sustain their struggle whatever </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>the cost.  The campaign against collaborators and the ruthless </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>elimination of agents of white authority will continue.  More </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>and more black townships will be rendered ungovernable and </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>the process of creating popular structures of self-government </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>within them will gather momentum.  The number of street and </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>area committees will increase and their functions will </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>progressively".</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a> So far the quote of the Eminent Persons Group.  Those were the very </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>reasons why it was imperative to launch constitutional negotiations and bring </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>it to finality.  To many of us this became a dream of which we never lost </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>sight.  Some of us, on both sides of the political divide, however, still had to </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>learn and others are still learning the Chris Hani truism once expressed to me </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a> "We concede the fact that we never broke the back of the South </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>African Defence Force and South African Police, but you must </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>concede the fact that you never broke the spirit of liberation in </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>the townships".</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>To my mind this was the basis of the political settlement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a> When the epilogue of the interim constitution was finally accepted at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>very late stage in the negotiation process which gave South Africa its new </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>democratic dispensation many of us gave a sigh of relief.  The relief we felt </p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>was for the fact that we could have the full truth out in the open without </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>vengeance.  A country has to know its history.  We hurt one another and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>time has come for healing.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a> I believe had it not been for that milestone judgment of Justice </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>Mahomed in the Azapo case brought against the State President we would not </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>have had the situation which we have today as Justice Mahomed had said in </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>that judgment that we were moving away from the shame of the past to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>hope of the future, and that that epilogue had granted him the opportunity to </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>make the judgment which he did, and that is why we are all here, and that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>why we had felt the relief at that particular moment in December 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a> With the National Party government the question of amnesty and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>inevitability of a Commission probing the past was never the subject of </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>penetrating debate where one and all expressed their expectations or anxieties </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>openly.  Everybody had played their cards close to the chest and discussions </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>in this regard were inconclusive, often resulting in lobby discussions.  This </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>always left me with a feeling of discontent.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a> I don't feel as if I am in the dock today, and I don't feel as if I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>being charged with anything which I had done, criminally or otherwise.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>don't believe that I am pleading for my innocence here today.  I participate in </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>these proceedings gladly, openly, but that particular paragraph does make me </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>a little bit angry in the sense that I would have loved to have seen the State </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>Security Council, as it functioned on which I served as a coopted member </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>under the Chairpersonship of Mr P W Botha today, deal with the accusations </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>that we have to answer here.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a> And I believe that it is a pity that, excuse me for saying this about two </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>great men of this country, namely Mr Botha and Mr de Klerk, that they have </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>had their squabbles with one another that we are not today standing here in </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>front of you as a coordinated team of the Security Council.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a> And that is the next point I make, namely, that the National </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>Management System has had as its prime function the coordination of State </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>activities, and yet listening to the evidence of all of us our actions, we are not </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>here as a coordinated team under the chairmanship of our leaders, the leaders </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>being Mr Botha who was the Chairperson of that State Security Council and </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>the leader of the National Party Mr de Klerk at that time.   And you will </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>recall and I remember that Mr de Klerk had said at his appearance where I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>present, that he had done his utmost to consult and to coordinate, but the facts </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>speak differently.  The facts speak that the officials are talking in one </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>direction, we are talking in another direction and the leaders, the Chairpersons </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>of this, the Chairperson of the Security Council and Mr de Klerk who </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>inherited the leadership did not successfully mould all of us into one team as </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>we are.  But I continue to speak of my own bat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a> I believe that there is a direct link between the National Management </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>System, the Harare Declaration, Mr de Klerk's February speech, the agreed </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>constitutional principles that formed the basis of our constitution and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>signing ceremony of our constitution on the 10th of December 1996 in </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>Sharpeville.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a> The National Management system was a holding operation to ensure </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>that negotiations are launched and that the constitutional order was changed </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>through the ballot box and not through the barrel of a gun.  That was </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>paramount in our minds.  It was foremost in our minds.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a> The Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group in its document on page 42 </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>says it all -</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a> "No serious person we met was interested in a fight to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>finish.  All favoured negotiations and peaceful solutions".</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a> General Viljoen in evidence before you said that this was a dirty war, </p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>and in many respects it was.  People were forced to drink cooking oil; people </p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>were forced to eat raw fish and raw meat; and on the other hand there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>men with balaclavas from nowhere assaulting innocent citizens and those </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>answers have not yet been found to my satisfaction or to my mind how that all </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>came about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a> The Harare Declaration, to continue in this thread, proposed steps to </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>create a climate for constitutional negotiations.  In the words of an ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>discussion partner, partners, they had to deal with the fact that it was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>viable to storm Pretoria with smoking guns and in this way take over power.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>The door for constitutional principles to form the basis for the final </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>constitution and to facilitate the transitional process was opened in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>document.  I regret that typing error.  On the 2nd of February speech was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>statesman's response to his constituency's aspirations that the conflict and </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>political stalemate should be ended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a> I want to add that if there ever was a civilian in our ranks that was Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>F W de Klerk.  I know people accuse him of many things but I will be untrue </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>if I don't publicly state that in our ranks the civilian was F W de Klerk, </p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>always, always warning and saying don't allow yourselves to be militarised.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>That was F W de Klerk.  The first one to disband the National Management </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>System was F W de Klerk because he had always felt uneasy with that system.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a> The signing ceremony of the final Constitution on the 10th of </p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>December 1996 in Sharpeville was symbolic, but it also signalled the fact that </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>after 48 years, to that day, namely the 10th of December 1948, South Africa </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>was now in step with the universal declaration of human rights.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a> I conclude by saying I am both an African and an Afrikaner.  I am a </p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>liberated Afrikaner.  I am also a proud Afrikaner.  Liberated Afrikaners took </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>the reform bit firmly between their teeth when it was necessary.  Both our </p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>hearts and our minds have been changed.  We love this country.  We have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>liberated from the baggage of an immoral system of government.  Afrikaners </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>can now resume their journey, galloping into the future, constructively </p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>criticise and participate in the affairs of State.  Afrikaners can now hold the </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>government accountable and support it where their actions merit it, campaign </p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>for a Volkstaat if they so wish, argue for the respect and recognition of </p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>Afrikaans without the baggage of the past.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a> I can think of no reason why Afrikaans-speaking South Africans and </p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>their children, or any other Afrikaner, from the cradle to the grave should bear </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>the burden of apartheid.  With the framework of the Constitution we will </p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>strive for our place and we will fight for Afrikaans.  It is right that the book </p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>of the past should be opened and must be interpreted, but then we must also </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>close them.  We dare not forget what has happened here, and I am not saying </p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>we should close the books and forget, but we should stop holding each other </p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>hostage in regard to the past and then bully each other mentally.  In this way </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>we will never build a country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a> We have reached the end of a journey on a road marked by pitfalls, </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>political doubts and obstacles.  However, the journey always carried forward, </p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>the road often became one of tight hairpin bends because I was afraid of </p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>negotiating the evils on bareback. I am now more than ever convinced that </p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>apartheid was a terrible mistake that blighted our land.  South Africans did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>listen to the laughing and the crying of each other.  I am sorry that I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>been so hard of hearing for such a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  I think it may be sensible for us to </p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>take a break for lunch and return at quarter to two.  Thank you very much both </p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>of you young men.   Thank you, thank you, it is very deeply moving and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>want to digest it and those people over there are looking forward to grilling </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>you.  We invite you to come for lunch with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>HEARING ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Glen.  I don't know which of the twins you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Mr Chairperson thank you very much.  I am going to address </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>my initial lines of questioning until I indicate otherwise to Mr Meyer, so I </p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>don't know whether Mr Wessels wants to remain seated there in the firing line </p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>as it were, no you are welcome to but - well whichever.  Thank you very </p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a> Mr Meyer in reading your statement is it correct, do I understand it </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>correctly that you base your acceptance of political responsibility on the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>that with hindsight, with the benefit of hindsight you recognise that at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>time perhaps more stringent steps should have been taken to curb the </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>transgressions which were recurring and that in essence the basis for </p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>responsibility that you accept is that of omissions on your part as you explain </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>and perhaps persons other than yourself as well, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>MR MEYER:   Chairperson I don't think I have to add anything to what I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>actually stated there in the written paragraph in this regard.  Obviously it </p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>deals with the obvious question, what did our guys at the time do about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>situation?  And I think one had to ask yourself that question and that is my </p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>response to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>MR MEYER:   ...specifically, I am sorry to the wording that is contained there </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>in paragraph 4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Thank you.  If one has regard to paragraph 3 of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>submission, for a moment I want to leave aside the first bullet point there </p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>because that deals, as you have indicated with where there were specific </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>instructions in that instance, regarding the other two aspects on which </p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>responsibility and accountability should be apportioned is it correct that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>are really two options here?  The one is that unlawful actions which were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>specifically authorised, which were bona fide on the one hand and there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>those that were mala fide in the sense that people abused their opportunities </p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>and so on, is that correct, that's the schema?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>MR MEYER:   I am trying to make the distinguishing there between bullets </p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>two and three.  On the one side I am suggesting that as far as bullet two is </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>concerned there were transgressions that could have been made on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>impression that the person might have had that he or she was authorised by </p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>implication or that their actions would have carried the blessing of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>government.  I think that is the one category. </p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a> And then I am also saying that it could have also happened as a result </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>of over-eagerness on the side of the person that he or she had gone too far as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>result of that over-eagerness and interpreted the mandate beyond what was </p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>actually a reasonable sort of mandate.  But the distinction between that and </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>the third bullet to my mind lies in the fact that the third bullet deals with </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>some cases that have become known, cases that have already served before the </p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>court, where to my mind it deals with situations where the person acted on his </p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>or her own agenda.  There is a clear distinction, to my mind, between the two.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a> I am not saying the first one, that is the second bullet for that matter, </p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>necessarily presents one with a clear answer, and therefore I refer to it as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>grey area.  And also in my discussions with Professor Villa-Vicencio and Ms </p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>Rousseau, I think it was indicated that there is this grey area in regard to </p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>interpreting where was the limits of implied, an implied mandate or not, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>covered that all under bullet two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Thank you.  I take it then that on the basis of that distinction, </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>that schema as it were, you've set out that you would then accept that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>may well be instances in which the unlawful killing of a political opponent </p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>was as a result of a bona fide action on the part of a security force member, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>MR MEYER:   I guess the question of bona fide actions in this regard is </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>relevant.  I've also looked into the submission of General Malan in that </p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>regard, in regard to this subject of bona fides, and in general it seems to me </p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>one can concur with all that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>MR GOOSEN:   So you would accept that in this schema of responsibility and </p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>accountability that it would have been possibly reasonable for a member of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>security forces to have unlawfully killed a political opponent of government, </p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>MR MEYER:   I tend to think immediately of the most recent example that has </p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>come to knowledge in terms of testimony last week regarding the Ribeiro case, </p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>and I think that is the kind of case in point.  But what I am suggesting here in </p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>an overall picture is that there are three dimensions, and I don't want to, don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>have to go over it again, but this grey area remains grey and one will have to </p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>probably go into the facts regarding each and every case separately because in </p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>some cases it might be quite easy to determine whether there was an implied </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>mandate.  In other cases there might have been no link but that the person who </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>acted still acted on that belief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>MR GOOSEN:   But in principle you would accept that there may be </p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>circumstances, and yes we will have to go into each particular set of facts in </p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>say an amnesty hearing, but in principle on this schema you would accept that </p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>it may be reasonable for a member of the security forces to have unlawfully </p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>killed a political opponent or a person perceived as a revolutionary or a </p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>supporter of a revolutionary cause at that time, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>MR MEYER:   I think the implication of what I am saying here from that one </p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>can make that deduction, but as to the implications that you are suggesting I </p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>am not quite sure whether one has worked through all the consequences as far </p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>as that is concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Does that not then also imply that the level of political </p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>responsibility that it is necessary to accept political responsibility for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>creation of a climate in which it may have been reasonable for members of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>security forces to have unlawfully killed political opponents of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>MR MEYER:   My suggestion would be that the climate was there in any </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>event.  I don't think it was necessarily created by the political or military or </p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>police chiefs at the point.  I think the climate was there and it's for that reason </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>important that one keeps in mind the nature of the conflict to my mind, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>that is why I also referred to that in paragraph 5 in a broader sense.   There </p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>was on the one side daily activities - I can remember during the time I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>responsible in the position that I am dealing here with, mainly '87, that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>were reports on a daily basis of different acts of terrorism, or the killing of </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>people from necklacing, or the planting of bombs and so forth, and of course </p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>that created one side of the picture.  We had an on-going situation of action </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>leading to reaction, and reaction leading to further action.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a> So I am suggesting that the climate was there and it might not </p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>necessarily have been related even to a specific occasion where one could </p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>deduct a specific implied mandate.  But the general circumstances might have </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>implied that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>MR GOOSEN:   I accept that a climate may be there but would you not accept </p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>that political leadership, I mean we are dealing here now with State Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>policy and for that reason not concentrating on organs of the State and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>people that were involved in that, but that politicians, senior leadership of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>security forces sustained a particular climate, a climate which rendered it </p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>reasonable for members of the security forces to act unlawfully, including the </p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>killing of political opponents of the State in certain circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>MR MEYER:   I would be hesitant to make any specific deduction in that </p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>regard.  I want to again emphasise what I have stated there in paragraph 2 that </p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>I am not aware of any specific such situation and that it definitely didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>happen in these organs of State.  What happened of course amongst </p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>individuals and what happened in line function departments I can't witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>MR GOOSEN:   But we are talking about the creation of a framework, a policy </p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>framework, an approach to the resolution of the problem and that that included </p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>statements and policies which when interpreted by the people who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>required to implement those policies and reasonably interpreted that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>could establish their authorisation for unlawful actions.  In those </p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>circumstances do you not accept that political responsibility would have to </p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>attach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>MR MEYER:   I am trying to put forward a framework here within which, well </p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>for which I am trying to be helpful in trying to find a way forward because </p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>truly these questions come up on an on-going basis.  I mean just this morning </p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>one heard them but I can imagine that the Commission itself is on an on-going </p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>basis confronted with these questions and I am trying to put forward a </p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>framework that hopefully can be helpful in analysing the situation, but I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>have the detailed information available to make conclusions of that and </p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>therefore I think one has to, if this kind of framework is being adopted one </p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>will have to go to the details and ascertain.  And it's also for that reason under </p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>bullet 2 that I suggest it remains a grey area and I don't think it's possible to </p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>make a single conclusion on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>MR GOOSEN:   I too am trying to deal at the level of the framework because I </p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>think that that's where we are.  What I am trying to establish is whether in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>framework that you are putting forward you accept that the policies, the full </p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>ambit of counter-revolutionary policies and approaches adopted by the State </p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>Security Council, the Cabinet, whether that framework reasonably interpreted </p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>by an operative on the ground could be interpreted to mean that that person </p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>has authorisation to commit unlawful acts on behalf of the security forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>MR MEYER:   Well I guess that is where the concept of an implied mandate </p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>can come in, and it's for that reason that I am suggesting that there is a moral </p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>responsibility.  But to the extent of which there is such a possibility I can't </p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>judge because that is not within the framework of my knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Perhaps just to put the question in this way maybe we can </p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>deal with it then conceptually.  In your view how could a person, or is it </p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>possible that a person could have reasonably interpreted and acted bona fide </p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>in that interpretation, in killing a political opponent?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a> And is it possible for you to give an example in which you would </p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>regard such action as a reasonable interpretation of events or a bona fide </p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>action on the part of the member of the security forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>MR MEYER:   I can't think of a good example, it's not one that I would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>reached that conclusion on before but in relation to what has been testified, </p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>and this is not necessarily in a political context, but in a relationship between </p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>the official concerned and his minor, is what became clear through the Ribeiro </p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>case.  But I don't have other examples that I can think of immediately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>MR GOOSEN:   On that basis then, I mean we can, I don't particularly want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>do it, but we can run through a number of instances that we now know were - </p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>involved the killing of political opponents of the former government and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>can list many of those and we can ask whether in each one of those instances </p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>you would regard that as possibly a reasonable interpretation of State policy </p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>in that regard, but we can leave that aside for the moment.   The question </p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>then is if, if it is possible in the schema that there could have been a </p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>reasonable interpretation which permitted the commission of an unlawful act, </p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>is it not then necessary that political responsibility should be accepted not </p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>only on the basis of omission but on the basis of commission, the creation of </p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>circumstances in which operatives on the ground could reasonably interpret </p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>policy to authorise the unlawful killing of a political opponent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>MR MEYER:   I won't necessarily come to that conclusion because I believe </p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>there is testimony before the Commission from at least some of those that </p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>were politically responsible that would definitely indicate that they have not </p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>given such instructions or that if it was implied that they have given such </p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>instructions on the basis of a commission, then it's not a correct version, it's </p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>not the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Mr Meyer I am not talking here about commission in respect </p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>of a specific instance, I am talking about commission on the part of members </p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>of participants in organs of State such as the State Security Council and </p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>Cabinet, commission, collective commission of the creation of a climate in </p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>which it was reasonable for a security force member to kill a political </p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>opponent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>MR MEYER:   I don't think one can say that it would have gone beyond the </p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>possibility of what I have been stating there in bullet two, I don't think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>MR GOOSEN:   So do I understand that you say you would not agree that </p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>political responsibility should be assumed then on the basis that a set of </p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>circumstances were created by the State Security Council in which operatives </p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>could act unlawfully?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>MR MEYER:   As far as the State Security Council is concerned, as far as my </p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>knowledge is concerned, definitely not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Would the same apply in respect of statements made, </p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>positions adopted by politicians serving in the State Security Council or in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>Cabinet in respect of what needs to be done in order to combat the </p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>revolutionary onslaught?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>MR MEYER:   Again I don't have knowledge of that kind whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>MR GOOSEN:   I think you would agree that you served in a senior position </p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>on the State Security Council from 1986, as a member of the State Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>Council, you certainly were party to discussions which occurred at that level.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>You also were as a serving politician in the country at the time must surely be </p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>aware of a significant number of statements in which politicians made it very </p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>clear, very clear that a revolutionary onslaught and revolutionaries in </p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>particular had to be combated with all means at the disposal of the State, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>that every possible effort should be made to crush the revolutionary onslaught, </p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a>MR MEYER:   Well I think it's like Pik Botha was saying yesterday, I've read </p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>through his testimony and I guess it's like he has indicated in that, that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>were probably statements of a general political nature that might have created </p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>different impressions but it all depends on how people who have received </p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>those messages have interpreted it within the scope of their authority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>MR GOOSEN:   That's precisely the point.  I mean the fact of the matter is we </p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>know from a whole spate of amnesty applications that they were in fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>interpreted to authorise killings.  What I am asking you is if you can comment </p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>as to whether you regard that as reasonable interpretation?  If you do regard it </p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>as a reasonable interpretation should you not accept political responsibility </p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>MR MEYER:   It all depends again on what - one will have to go into each </p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>case and determine what consequences the person who pronounced might have </p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>foreseen or not.  Even looking at some of the documentation that you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>made available to me there are obviously different interpretations that one can </p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>reduce from every single such pronouncement, if I am right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>MR GOOSEN:   But if the interpretation is that we have a general </p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>authorisation for acceptance of, I mean you indicated, you say that individuals </p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>under the impression that they were authorised by implication, now you accept </p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>that that could happen.  What I am asking you is whether in the circumstances </p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>in which there was an impression that they were authorised by implication </p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>whether that would have been reasonable or not?  If it is reasonable does it </p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>not follow that at a political level responsibility should attach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>MR MEYER:   I guess the question is actually what one could have adduced </p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>from the person who made the pronouncement, what he could have foreseen in </p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>terms of consequences, of the consequences or not.  And again I think one has </p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>to go back to every single case.  I don't think - well let me put it emphatically, </p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>I am saying to you that from my knowledge that could not have been the </p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>conclusion reached in terms of the activities of the organs of State that I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>involved in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>MR GOOSEN:   We are not talking here about specific authorisation, we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>talking about the adoption of a set of policy guidelines which you </p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>acknowledge would be interpreted by the people who acted.  So the question </p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>is, you acknowledge that they were interpreted, the question is in those </p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a>circumstances would it be reasonable, in principle is it reasonable for a person </p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a>to have interpreted those policies to authorise the unlawful killing of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>political opponent?  And we get back to that point.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a> If it is not reasonable,  under no circumstances could it be reasonable, </p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>yes, then political responsibility would only have to attach on an individual </p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>who made a particular pronouncement, but if in principle, if in principle it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>possible for the interpretation to be reasonable, State policy, then at that level </p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>political responsibility must attach, surely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>MR MEYER:   In the way that you have described it my answer would be no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Now in circumstances where to the Minister of Defence would </p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a>make a statement to the effect that every effort should be made, terrorists </p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>should be wiped out, those who come across the border carrying their limpet </p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>mines and so on that they must be tracked down, whether they are inside the </p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>country or outside of the country they must be annihilated, them and their </p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>supporters or their "meelopers", now in those circumstances would you not </p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>agree that that generates a climate in which susceptible to reasonable </p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a>interpretation, that unlawful actions are authorised? I am not asking that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>should condemn the Minster of Defence, he made such a statement, we can get </p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>the full quote for you - that's a summary of it.  I am not asking you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>condemn a former Minister of Defence, I am asking you in principle, in terms </p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>of the climate created.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>MR MEYER:   But I guess you are now back with the individual again.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>are back with the individual now, or the individual case or the line functionary </p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>now again.  The previous question was about a general atmosphere as far as </p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>what was created by the State as such.  I mean you are now referring to an </p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a>individual Minister and my answer in that regard would be to go to the facts </p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a>of each and every single case because that is what I am suggesting in bullet </p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>two.  I don't think it would be correct to assume that -  No let me frame it </p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>differently.  I am not trying to address the individual cases in my submission </p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>here, because to my mind that will have to be analysed on the merit of each </p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>MR GOOSEN:   So there is in your schema no scope for collective </p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a>responsibility other than on the basis of omissions, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>MR MEYER:   My reference there is I think quite clear, namely that under </p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>bullet two I am saying that there has to be an acceptability, to my mind, on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>side of the previous government of a responsibility, a moral responsibility </p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>which led to the circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>MR GOOSEN:   But Mr Meyer that's precisely the point, what is the basis of </p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>that moral and political responsibility is it founded upon an acceptance that </p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a>State policies were susceptible to a reasonable interpretation that unlawful </p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>actions were authorised or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a>MR MEYER:   Is the question not really what moral responsibility means?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Let's look at - let's leave moral responsibility, let's look at </p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>political responsibility because you refer to political responsibility, what is </p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a>the basis of that political responsibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a>MR MEYER:   I am not sure whether I have all the information available on </p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>that or all the knowledge available on that, but it seems to me in the context </p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>what it's being used here for is to say well if this would have happened to a </p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>person in the political position whilst he or she is still in office that could </p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>have resulted in the resignation or the sacking of that particular person as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a>political act, and I think that is the kind of meaning that could be attached to </p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a>it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>MR GOOSEN:   And would that be confined then purely to line functional </p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>departments rather than any sense of collective responsibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>MR MEYER:   I think what is being suggested here and it is something that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>understand it also came up otherwise before the Commission is the question of </p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>a consideration of a collective moral responsibility because none of those </p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a>members are still in Cabinet at this stage, so politically they could not be </p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a>sacked in any event or resign, but it's accepting a moral responsibility in </p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>terms of what the Cabinet then as it were had to take responsibility for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a>MR GOOSEN:   So the question as to whether State policy directives were </p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a>susceptible to reasonable misinterpretation that they authorised unlawful </p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>actions that would not feature at all in the scheme of political responsibility </p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a>which we'll have to attach in respect of those individual matters?  You've </p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>indicated that, when I asked you what the basis for the acceptance of political </p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>responsibility was you'd say well if the line function or the department, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a>person who made the statement, if that person could, on the basis of those </p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>statements be dismissed, politically dismissed for being in breach of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a>policy in regard to that matter, then and only then would political </p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>responsibility attach.  That is as I understand your answer to the question.  Is </p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>that correct or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>MR MEYER:   I think there must be some differentiation between political and </p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a>other forms of responsibility. I am trying to define what political </p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a>responsibility in this regard would mean.  Obviously it is different from </p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>criminal responsibility or accountability.  But I am trying to put forward again </p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>a framework in that regard.  I can't give judgement on specific cases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Ilan I thought you....</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>MR LAX:   Chairperson I want to just deal with the practicality for example </p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>and this relates to a point in time before your time Mr Meyer on the SSC.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>know that the SSC authorised at times raids into neighbouring states for </p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>example and that people were killed in those raids.  Not only were those </p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>people foreign citizens but there were South Africans and innocent foreign </p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>citizens killed in some of those raids.  We can take one instance the Maseru </p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>raid in December 1985 for example.  That raid was authorised almost </p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>implicitly if you like by the SSC so we are led to understand, now does that </p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>make them collectively responsible say in line with your first bullet?  And if </p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>not does that make them responsible in line with your second bullet?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a> It doesn't include you personally because you weren't there at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>time, but at the same time you are in a position to have been there at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>different time and pass judgement and give us your view of the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>MR MEYER:   I guess it's quite difficult.  One will have to go into what </p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>exactly that decision I guess, that resolution if there was one, amounts to, if </p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a>one looks at the wording what it amounts to and so forth, one might be able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>come to a conclusion.  I find myself a little bit in difficulty there because I </p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>can't speak of first-hand information or knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>MR LAX:   You can take it from me that there was a resolution on December </p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>the 20th, 1985, that those sorts of raids, that particular raid should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>conducted and it was so conducted.  We heard last week of other raids and Pik </p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>yesterday spoke about a raid that he didn't even know about that interfered </p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>with his own working.  This is a specific instance where we know that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>decision was authorised.  You can take it from me, I am not misleading you, </p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>it's gospel.  (Laughter)  In a vernacular sort of sense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>MR MEYER:   But I guess there would be an argument and I am testing now </p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>because I am not quite sure, but there might be an argument about cross-</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>border raids and authorising that.  If I remember correctly General Malan also </p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>addressed that in his submission to you, and there is a different position in </p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>regard to cross-border raids than to what happened internally.  I am sort of </p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>asking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>MR LAX:   Well you see we haven't focused much on cross-border raids </p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a>because individuals that have come before us last week for example were all </p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>in one way or another involved in some of the cross-border raids, and because </p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>of the whole extradition issue not being resolved they didn't deal with it and </p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>so we didn't talk a great deal about it at that point but you are not involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>and therefore there's an ample opportunity to deal with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>MR MEYER:   It would be unfair to make me either the advocate or the judge </p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>in a case like this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Wynand Malan wants to say something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>MR MALAN:   I want to, I am thinking back of the time, '85 when it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>quoted, one of the concepts that was often discussed is the concept of </p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>collective responsibility, Cabinet responsibility.  On that basis I want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>rephrase the question in a frame that I think will be sitting more comfortable </p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>in your mind because it's a frame that has been addressed, within which it has </p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>been addressed before.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a> If at the level of Cabinet or then for that matter State Security Council, </p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>whatever body, a decision is taken and implementation of that decision </p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>follows don't you accept total responsibility for that decision and its </p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>consequences?  Isn't that really the question?  Whether it is political or moral </p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a>or criminal that's something else, the test is on the outside, it's not your test </p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a>and frankly this is a bit of a problem that I experience with the line of </p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>questioning because I find that a construction is asked from the witness which </p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>is more one of a legal, technical or philosophical one whereas what I think is </p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>important is whether responsibility is accepted.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a> Now if that responsibility so is accepted in the plain proposition that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a>put would it not also be true that if, whether that is by negligence or omission </p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>or whatever reason, that whatever you did or was done in such a meeting or </p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>body, that those who were part of it is by definition saddled with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>responsibility?  Again whatever kind of responsibility that is, political, moral, </p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>criminal, whatever, but the test is not for you to decide, the test is on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a> My question to you is, are you trying to duck some of the things that </p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>you did or are you saying whatever I did I accept responsibility, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>construction that follows is something that is on the outside of me?  Would </p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a>you be prepared to go with such a proposition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a>MR MEYER:   I think that is what I tried to put here in a framework, exactly </p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a>that, but I have the impression that some of the questions indicate that I must </p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>interpret what individuals might have had in mind in terms of consequences </p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>and so forth and that I can't make a deduction on.  So I would go along with </p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>an interpretation that you have constructed because I think that is essentially </p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a>what I am trying to say in bullet two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a>MR MALAN:   And if - sorry Chairperson just for the - and if any </p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a>construction would be put to whatever was done which would be construed as </p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a>criminal liability and prosecutions following in a court of law then you will be </p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a>quite comfortable with accepting the process as the process again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>MR MEYER:   Indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>MR WESSELS:  Mr Chairman may I just establish something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you have a right to speak.  (Laughter)</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>MR WESSELS:   Thank you.  I'd just like to establish, if we play rugby the </p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a>reserve bench cannot come into play unless he is authorised.  If this is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a>wrestling contest I mean you come in regardless of what the referee says and </p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a>then he calls you to order.  Now Mr Goosen indicated that I am on the reserve </p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>bench right now ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>MR GOOSEN:   We are playing rugby....</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>MR WESSELS:   Right, then I remain silent. </p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   It seems to me that you are likely to ask much the same sort </p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>of questions, this particular question, and if you feel I mean that there is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a>contribution you can make why not make it now.  The only thing is that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a>see I mean you keep giving him a chance to work out, if you are going to ask </p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>him the same questions so he's working out no, they don't like this answer </p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>maybe I am going to try that answer.  Alright, do you think you should......</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>MR GOOSEN:   I think Mr Chairperson the idea is simply to - I've been </p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>operating on the basis of the framework presented in the submission and I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>simply interrogating that and I think obviously Mr Wessels' submission, whilst </p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>it may overlap with in some respects it's formulated in a different way and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>want to deal with him separately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a> Mr Meyer I am not asking you to comment on individual interpretations </p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>and I will take issue with Commissioner Malan about the external construction </p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>of this, it's not a philosophical debate.  You put forward a schema which is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a>basis upon which accountability and responsibility should be adjudged.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>Central to that second bullet point is a recognition on your part that </p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a>individuals may have been under the impression that they were authorised by </p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a>implication.  Now yes, accept that when you deal with a specific instance we </p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a>are going to have to determine whether in that particular instance it was, </p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>whether that person in fact was under that impression, was not acting on some </p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a>other motive.  We are not talking about the motive of the person here.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a> We are talking about whether it is possible, as a matter of principle, </p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>whether it was possible for security police operatives or security force </p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a>operatives to reasonably interpret State Security Council and Cabinet National </p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>Party policy statements and so on, to authorise unlawful activity, whether it </p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a>was reasonable?  Whether you accept, as a matter of principle that it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>reasonable?  If you say no, well then the consequence attaches to that in terms </p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>of the schema that you've raised.  But if you say yes, another consequence </p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>attaches.  I want to know whether you accept that in principle it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>reasonable that such misinterpretations could occur or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>MR MALAN:   Chairperson may I just - look really I am not sure that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>understand the question. If the question is could have then that's something, </p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>but was is a different question then we need to look at the facts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>MR GOOSEN:   The question was could have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>MR MEYER:   I was just going to say as one of the possibilities for </p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>consideration surely, and that certainly then depends on the specific </p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>circumstances, if you say could have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Then in those instances where it is established that it was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>misinterpretation, okay, do you accept that collective political responsibility </p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>attaches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a>MR MEYER:   Of a moral and political nature, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Okay.   Thank you.  We are going to move on to another </p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>element of your presentation.  I want to deal with paragraph 5.  Let me just </p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>check something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a> Perhaps the panel want to pick up on any questions whilst I am doing </p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>the - if the panel wants to pick up on a question to save time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   He has been very disciplined and was waiting to be guided </p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>by you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>MR GOOSEN:     That makes a change Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>CHAIRPERSON:    Are you ready.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>MR GOOSEN:    Thank you Mr Chairperson. Mr Meyer, can I refer you to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>document which was also provided to you, that's the Concept National </p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>Strategy, the Revolutionary War, Strategy No. 44.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a>You indicate that part of the total counter Revolutionary Strategy was that a </p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>tremendous amount of effort was put into utilising the force of the state in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>counter mobilisation plan. In the document, reference is made to at Page 4 of </p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>the document.  The existence of the anti-revolutionary group loss such as </p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>Inkatha or ZZC or the...(intervention) </p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>MR MEYER: Can you just help me with the exact reference, I am on Page 4 </p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>and I don't see this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>MR GOOSEN:    I beg your pardon it is Page 4, it's 8B. Paragraph 8B on Page </p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>4 of the document. The paragraph there reads anti-resistance of anti-</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>revolutionary groups such as Inkatha, ZZC as well as the Ethnic Factor in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>South African Society, makes the preparation for a coherent revolutionary </p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a>onslaught difficult and states that it is one of the factors to take into account.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>And then under Objectives, 6 at the top, there is reference to Groups and </p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a>individuals to mobilise them and to protect themselves and to assist the </p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a>Revolutionary actions. </p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a> Do I take it that that doelstelling is a reference to the fact that </p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>grouping such as Inkatha and or the ZCC and perhaps other anti-revolutionary </p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a>groups could be mobilised to resist revolutionary activities and to protect </p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>themselves against those revolutionary activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a>MR MEYER:   Thank you, it is kind of fun to go through all these old </p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a>documents and to refresh one's mind. Thank you for making this available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a> If one looks at the first paragraph that you quoted on Page 4, 8B, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>think it refers to what they call Analysis of Capacity under Paragraph 7 you </p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>have Analysis of the, what one can say the Revolutionary elements, analysis </p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a>of the capacities of radical organisations and under Paragraph 8 you there see </p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a>an analysis of, let us call it the strong points inside of the South African </p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a>government society and then 8B, is then mentioned as a strong point because </p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>there were allegedly certain anti-revolutionary groups that could have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>helpful and could have assisted in combating revolution and if you follow that </p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a>up and look the schedule, I think you will find the answer there in the quest </p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a>for looking at what the specific actions were that arose from those and if you </p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a>look at this document it is a schedule, it is unfortunately not numbered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>The schedule says objectives and overall conduct and actions against the </p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a>revolutionary war and if you go to paragraph 6 thereof, I think the last two </p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a>pages of that, you there find more or less an indication of the kind of actions </p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>proposed and contemplated, in order to strengthen and secure society and to </p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a>help society to resist the revolutionary onslaught. I think that's the context in </p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>which it must be seen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a>MR GOOSEN:    If we go to paragraph 8 on that Annexure where the </p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>Delstelling and the Oorhof se optrede are then set out in columns and what </p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a>corresponds with the objective to mobilise groups and groupings to encourage </p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a>them to resist which then go through onto the following page. No. 2 there, </p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>Counter Revolutionary Organisations must be developed along ethnic lines in </p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a>order to prevent the political vacuum being exploited by the radical elements </p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a>and one of the actions under 4, black parents must be organised and supported </p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a>in order to prepare parental authority and to counter the manipulation of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a>youth by the radical elements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a> You were present when I raised some questions in regard to these </p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a>matters to Mr Vlok, would you say that it was on the basis of these, this </p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>policy's framework, this approach to contra-mobilisation that it was policy of </p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a>the government and the Security forces then, because it falls under Safety, to </p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a>manipulate differences that occurred within communities, exploit tensions that </p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>existed within the communities, to specifically organise and prompt the </p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a>establishment of organisations based on an ethnic basis and to utilise through </p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a>that support, those organisations, to engage in active resistance against efforts </p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a>by revolutionary organisations as defined at the time within communities in </p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a>which those organisations were organising.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a>MR MEYER:   No, that is never how I understood it, in terms of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>particular context. I think what one can deduct from what is stated here under </p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a>for instance 8.2 Paragraph 8.2 is that it was very much in the frame of </p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a>thinking of the constitutional solution at that stage that we needed a </p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a>democratic solution based on Group Rights and that was all in that framework. </p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a>If you look at the original statement, Objectives as defined in the introduction </p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a>to the document. I can't find it exactly now, but I can recall reading through </p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a>it, it was stated there that the purpose is to develop - oh, here it is, can I read </p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a>it Mr Chairperson, it is Paragraph 9 of the main document Page 5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a> To neutralise the revolutionary war against the republics of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a>democratic dispensation can be developed here in which all the groupings of </p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a>the population can take part in the government of the country without </p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a>threatening each other's rights, because it was quite clearly the overall </p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a>intention with the stated goal. That was part of the Constitutional thinking at </p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a>the time that a democratic solution should be arrived on a basis of group or </p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a>ethnic rights and I think that one should see that therefore also in Paragraph </p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a>8.2 later on in a context of what was intended there, but I can't recall any </p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a>experience where this was a specific intention to play of one group against </p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>another on the basis of putting them to a fight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>MR GOOSEN:  Then can I refer you to the other document which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a>provided to you which was tabled at the GVS Werkgroup on the 24th January </p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a>1987 Strategic considerations in respect of the initiation of the counter </p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a>mobilisation in South Africa and I refer you to Page 11 of that document </p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a>where it says at the top the Following measures may be considered, </p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a>encouraged, distrust ethic and tribal defences and all other divisive factors </p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a>amongst the enemy, discredit them and their helpers internally and outside the </p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a>country and as individuals under these organisations. How does that maatreel </p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>fit in with the notion that you have just explained in regard to the . . .</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a>MR MEYER:   I also noted that and can I make a general observation whilst </p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a>the first document that you have referred to is clearly something that reached </p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a>the level of the State Security Council, sort of neatly packaged and made </p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>sense in terms of what the Councillor have approved by then and what let us </p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a>say these apparatus were busy with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a> The second document which to my mind and I have read through it, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a>came to no other conclusion that it was drafted by an individual and probably </p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a>didn't go beyond the first level of discussions if it did, because there are so </p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a>many contradictions in that document itself, that one can only come to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a>conclusion as the person himself said in the very last part of the paragraph of </p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a>that document, Paragraph 20. "Many more loose ideas may be proposed" and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a>think that describes the whole document. It is a document of loose ideas and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a>can't imagine that that was every approved, I can't recall this document quite </p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a>frankly and I can't remember that I have ever seen it and I can't recall that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a>was every discussed in my presence. I tried to find out what might have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a>the status of that document but it seems nobody know. It was apparently </p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a>referred to a Working Group for discussion in January 1987. The point that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a>am concluding on is to say that for instance in Paragraph D that you have just </p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>read out, does not fall, what is intended there is, what is put forward there as </p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a>a loose thought, definitely did not fall in the ambit of what we were busy with </p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a>in the Joint Management Centre at that stage. I can't recall any specific </p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a>occasion where something like that was executed or planned by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a>Management Centre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a>MR GOOSEN:    So I take it from that that you would say in respect of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>first document that the Over arching conduct and actions and objectives would </p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>not be susceptible of an interpretation that ethnic conflict divisions in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>community should be manipulated and utilised in order to organise active </p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a>resistance against enemy organisations I include in enemy organisations the </p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>UDF. It is not susceptible of that interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a>MR MEYER:   It might have been but I am saying that it was not part of what </p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a>I was involved in or know about as far as the official operations of the Joint </p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a>Management Centre is concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Now, I accepted that you are saying on the basis of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a>document that that was not authorised, I accept that but you are saying, is it </p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a>conceivable that in the implementation of this the contra-mobilisation efforts </p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>as set out here in this document, the first document referred to, could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>been interpreted to mean something closer to the Paragraph D that I refer to in </p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a>the second document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a>MR MEYER:    I would say that, Paragraph 8 in the original, the first </p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a>document, I would say definitely had not as far as the official operations is </p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a>concerned, if that is the right word, have been considered or applied. Let me </p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a>take you to one specific example which relates to the point thereunder 8.4 </p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a>which you have also referred to of the first document. There it is stated under </p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>Remarks "Contaminated youth or youthful military elements must be removed </p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a>from society and must be rehabilitated according to acceptable practices" in </p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>that regard by the then Department of Education and Training, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a>established some training institutions for that purpose where rehabilitation </p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a>could take place, I think whether they were successful or not, that is not the </p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a>point but that was how it was done and operated, but I can't recall any </p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a>successful or even an attempt of operation under 8.2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a>MR GOOSEN:   So it was never policy for example, that members of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a>Security Forces would provide with overt or covert support to anti-</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>revolutionary groupings as were defined, anti-revolutionary groupings inside </p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a>the country in accordance with this policy. That was never policy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a>MR MEYER: I can't say that there were no covert activities of that kind, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a>can't say that because I won't know and I can't say that it was impossible as </p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a>far as that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a>CHAIRPERSON: Where such coverts support was in fact rendered it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>outside of the ambit of approved policy guidelines from that the level of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>State Security Council, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>MR MEYER:   No, all that I can say is that it could be interpreted in such a </p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a>way by a specific line function department. I won't know, but that is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a>impossible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I accept that you wouldn't know, but it would be a </p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>misinterpretation by that line function department to render that sort of </p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>support because that is not what was envisaged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>MR MEYER:   I don't think that was envisaged, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   It is not a question of whether you don't think it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a>envisaged, from what you have indicated that was not envisaged so therefore </p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a>if a line function department engaged in such kind of action it would be a </p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>misinterpretation, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a>MR MEYER:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>CHAIRPERSON: Would you say that it would be a reasonable </p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a>misinterpretation or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a>MR MEYER:   I said to you what I understand of A2 was and how it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a>interpreted to my mind by the both the State Security Council and all its </p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>subsidiaries and I think one can say within the overall policy framework at </p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a>that stage it would have been an unreasonable interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>MR GOOSEN:   So in respect of say the support for the Witdoeke in KTC June </p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a>of 1986 in Cape Town, support rendered by members of the Security forces, </p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a>attempts by the Joint Management Centre in the Western Cape to secure even </p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a>financial support from the Secretariat of the State Security Council in order to </p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a>support certain activities of the Witdoeke that that would all be, fall into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>realm of an unreasonable misinterpretation of what was envisaged in respect </p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>of counter mobilisation of contra mobilisation policies as approved by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>State Security Council.   Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a>MR MEYER: I think so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a>CHAIRPERSON: And presumably on that basis you would say that then no </p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>political responsibility could ever attach in respect of the actions by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>Security force members and all the participants in the meetings of the Joint </p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>Management Centre in respect of that covert support to the Witdoeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>MR MEYER: . . . but think so, we must just remember that this strategy 44 </p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a>came into being on the 1st December 1986 according to the document whilst </p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>those alleged activities if I remember correctly what you said this morning </p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a>took place at an earlier stage so one would not necessarily bring it in line with </p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>what is stated here in this strategy because the one came after the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   But presumably if it wasn't authorised at the point </p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a>November 1986 when this comprehensive plan is put in place, there was no </p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a>policy prior to that to provide that support from the, level of the State </p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a>Security Council.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a>MR MEYER:   I won't know from my own knowledge, one would have to go </p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a>through the documentation and maybe you and I will be proved incorrect, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a>as far as my own knowledge is concerned, I won't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a>MR GOOSEN:  Mr Meyer, thank you very much, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Are there any questions from the panel? Yasmin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a>MS SOOKA: Mr Meyer at Page 2, I think paragraph 4 of your own submission, </p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>you say the fact the term regarding deficiencies in the system in use at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>time, the fact that so many transgressions took place over a lengthy period is </p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a>an indication in itself that more vigilant actions was called for and with </p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a>hindsight and looking at the embarrassing facts now emerging one can argue </p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a>that more stringent steps should have been taken to curb the possibilities of </p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a>transgressions taking place and of you go on to take responsibility, but I think </p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a>the question does face us here is, given the policy of the counter revolutionary </p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a>strategy the fact that the security establishment was so powerful, how was it, </p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a>given what so many politicians have come forward to us to say that they didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a>actually know or else they would have taken steps to curb that. How was it </p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>possible for the kind of things that did happen to take place and where do we </p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>actually say "Where is this gap" I think that is my question, I have heard from </p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a>the politicians and I am sorry to be asking so many questions in one. But the </p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>real difficulty that faces us is where would one say the blame actually lies, </p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a>you have got the politicians on the top, you have got the State Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>Council, you have got the Generals, but somewhere in-between, something </p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>went wrong, and I think we would like your view on what it is that did go </p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a>wrong, because we actually go, you fall short here of taking criminal </p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a>responsibility or and I think one could actually question that, the whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a>concept of criteria, the liability of putting in to place things like Vlakplaas, </p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a>the CCB where you must have a sense that things can go horribly wrong. </p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a> Now, I think that is what we would like to get an answer on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a>MR MEYER: I guess nobody had the answer, maybe, and let me try to put </p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>forward this, from one's own view in that regard. Maybe it is just a question </p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>that things have developed over a period of time in such a way that in the end </p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>we were all part of a frame of mind, politicians, officials, people in minor </p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a>positions even that believed that there was an enemy that had to be wiped out, </p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a>the belief that there was not a just cause on the side of the majority of South </p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>Africans and the belief that for protection of the minority that was the right </p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a>thing and the only thing to do. Maybe it was, it was in the end fear that </p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a>dictated, that is why I refer to my submission to the fact that one had to look </p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a>at the total spectrum both dimensions of the conflict because that in itself </p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a>tells something about the demands and the fears that had developed at the time </p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>and in that context, it is probably not possible to even put at a specific point </p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a>or a specific place the blame, it was just overall, that is the feeling that one </p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>had today if you look back at it. So during this period, let us say the mid-'80's </p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a>in general, we probably have reached a stage when in any event the climate </p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a>was of such a nature that it was not sort of the in thing to raise questions. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>listened to the questions this morning and I was surprised in that regard, but it </p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a>was, it was not the in thing to ask questions, if you hear on a daily basis, </p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a>especially within government circles that people are being killed as a result of </p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a>an act of terrorism or necklacing is taking place on a daily basis, that bombs </p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a>are going off and things like that, you fall into a frame of mind that you stop </p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a>asking questions because it is not the right sort of thing to do at that moment </p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a>and I think that is the context that one has to put yourself back into for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a>sake of creating an understanding. </p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a> Looking back now, it is easy to make judgement and say "How the hell </p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a>could this happen" but then it was different and I am not trying to excuse </p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a>ourselves, I am trying to find out myself why, why could we let this happen, </p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a>some amongst us were bold and did take the necessary action, some were as </p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a>bold as to break out of the mould at that stage because they were driven to do </p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a>so. All that we can say is fortunately we all, we all arrived at a point </p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a>fortunately, we gained better insight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a>MS SOOKA:   And I think we maybe, one needs to say that we are not sitting </p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a>in judgement but we want to understand and for the same . . .(indistinct) the </p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a>answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a>CHAIRPERSON: The remarkable answer, I just wondered whether I could take </p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a>it just a little further, I mean take your construction further, in a way it is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a>breathtaking response to say publicly and this is one of the incredible things </p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a>about this country, you know, and sometimes we become blase and take it for </p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a>granted, but I don't know that anywhere else in the world would you get </p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a>someone who has been in government come before a Commission of this kind </p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a>and say what you have said just now, you know both of you are saying, yes, </p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a>well we got to a point where we were as we where and that gives the </p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a>opportunity for all of us to say, now we are actually are human and we have </p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a>got weaknesses, but your weakness paradoxically is a strength because it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a>ultimately really a strong person, a big person, who can say, you know, I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a>sorry but this is where I was and it almost seems like being, you know, like </p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a>nit-picking but I wonder whether you would be willing to say that given all </p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a>the things you say that happened in those years, I mean all the bombardment </p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a>about the kind of facts and that you didn't want to ask questions and I agree </p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>with Yasmin that, well we have a kind of small judicial thing judging facts </p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a>and so on, but in that setting it clearly seems possible and I think that is what </p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a>happened, that people said in order to achieve this goal, I mean that we will </p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a>resist this total onslaught, anything goes, I mean that no holes barred, and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a>is where we are now and we are trying now to say what happened how do you </p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a>overcome it. I don't know.  Well I, you see you are nodding and it is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a>coming into the dingus, I see you shaking your head, maybe you have to say </p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a>something. I mean it is almost superfluous because I think that that is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a>consequence of what you said, that I mean we were in that kind of a situation </p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a>and no holes barred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a>MR MEYER: I think you've said it, I think essentially, unfortunately that is to </p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a>what a great extent happened. Maybe it was because it was not necessarily </p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>Security ...(inaudible - recording deteriorates) all of it, it was across the </p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a>spectrum. And of course the misreading of the situation now is so clear, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a>whole idea of looking for an answer through counter-mobilisation or counter- </p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a>strategy in itself was wrong, it missed the point. I can recall we ourselves at </p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a>that stage, including myself, said yes the answer is political, we were almost </p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>taught to say the answer is 80% political and 20% security. But that in itself </p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a>was a complete misreading of the situation, because the political answers that </p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a>we sought were not the real answers and that in itself created even more </p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a>misunderstanding, I think, because the frustration that misreading of the real </p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a>answer must have caused on the other side, so to speak, on the side of those </p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a>that wanted to achieve liberation must have caused more and more frustration </p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a>because it was as if they could not break through with their messages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a>CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a>MR GOOSEN:   I have no questions for Mr Meyer, for Mr Wessels, yes a few.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure, I mean, Roelf you don't have to go because </p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>the Chairperson sometimes says some things at the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>MR MEYER:    I will wait for my partner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Alright, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>MR GOOSEN:    Thank you very much Mr Chairperson. Mr Wessels, one of </p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a>the disadvantages of being a reserve in a rugby match is that you possibly </p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a>only come on right at the very end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a>MR WESSELS:   That doesn't matter, as long as you know how long the game </p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a>is going to last, are we continuing tomorrow. (Laughter)</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a>MR GOOSEN:    No, we won't be long, I assure you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a>MR WESSELS:   No, I am not difficult, are we staying until 4.00pm or 3.30, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>just want to know how to place myself in answering the questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a>CHAIRPERSON: I had hoped for about 3.30 but what do you think?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a>MR GOOSEN:    Mr Chairperson, I think we will be finished by 3.30. I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a>have a great deal to ask Mr Wessels. Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a> I think Mr Wessels perhaps it picks up on the point that Mr Meyer has </p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a>just made, the issue that we have just been speaking about.  In reference to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a>portion in your statement on Page 2 where you state </p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a>"That I further do not believe the political defence I did not know is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a>available to me, because in many respects I believe I did not want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a>know".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a>and I really just want to ask if you can elaborate on that and if you can </p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a>explain and what it is you wish to convey, in perhaps more detail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a>MR WESSELS:   Well, I appreciate the remarks made by the Chair and by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a>Roelf and I endorse those sentiments, each and every one of them. I cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a>shy away from the fact that I am a National Party, that I was a National Party </p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a>politician, I was elected on the National Party political ticket, I had endorsed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a>each and every of those policies. The policy simply was since the days of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a>John Vorster that . . . (indistinct)  the highest law of the land would be the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a>security of the land, that had to do with the first detentions of people 90 days, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a>80 days. 16 years later, I was in Parliament, I was debating the Rabie </p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a>Commission and the framework, the launching pad was still the highest law of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a>the land, is the security of the land. Now amongst that framework, amongst </p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a>that frame of mind we had put legislation on the statute book. Numbers of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a>them. Security legislation, the Terrorism Act, within them were embodied, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a>sections, clauses which allowed policemen to question, to hold indefinitely </p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a>people in detention.  Subsequent to that we had in terms of Public Safety act </p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a>we called for states of emergency, we on the basis of that you need to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a>centralise authority in the hands of the executive, did exactly that, now </p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a>because we did that, I simply cannot see how I can ...(inaudible) back and say </p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a>sorry I did not know, it was foreseen that under those circumstances people </p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a>would be detained, people would be tortured, everybody in this country knew </p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a>people were tortured, they were tortured, you read it in the alternative Press, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a>anybody who had access to the Townships, my sources of information was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a>Chairman of ...(recording deteriorates and disappears) </p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a>MR WESSELS: Chairman of this Commission sitting next to him Wynand </p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a>Malan, Alex Boraine, we did battle on many occasions in Parliament in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a>face of attacks by Helen Suzman, Boraine and others simply saying the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a>Security forces were a law unto themselves and we argued, vehemently </p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>opposed that, we said you are misreading the situation, it is not true and yet it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>all happened right there under our noses, so I don't believe I can stand up and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a>say, sorry, I didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Does it flow from that then that you would accept that it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a>not directed at you personally, but at in those circumstances, the context that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a>you sketch that senior government officials subject to exactly the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a>context that you were subject to in effect chose not to know and accordingly </p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a>chose to create a climate of impunity for Security force members to act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a>MR WESSELS:   I take it I am also permitted to ask a question for you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a>further particulars, are we saying when you refer to officials, government </p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a>officials, could you just explain to me what are you talking of, are you talking </p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a>of politicians or officials of state, non-elected officials?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a>MR GOOSEN:    Let's stop at the politicians for the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a>MR WESSELS: I have no question in my mind, I have no doubt in my mind </p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a>but whatsoever, that that was the policy that you had to know what you had to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a>know. In other words what you did not have to know did not concern you. Let </p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a>me give you a simple example, for the better, for the better, I was interviewed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a>recently by a gentleman called Jonathan Malanski, he is busy with his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a>doctorate at the London School of Economics, he is busy with research in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a>country at this particular juncture. He questioned me about a resolution taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a>at the State Security Council dealing with the release of Mr Nelson Mandela. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a>believe it was taken in June 1988 and it is minuted as follows that a document </p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a>was circulated and the document was then drawn in or drawn back and was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a>then destroyed and he asked me what had happened there, because directly or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a>indirectly my name appears in and around that document.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a> The fact of the matter is the following: That the ..(inaudible) </p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a>Werkgroup the executive of the working group was charged to work a strategy, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a>to establish a strategy to try and facilitate the release of President Nelson </p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a>Mandela. Now in that discussion it was clear that everybody was not pulling, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a>pushing all the information that they had, it was clear in my mind that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a>Kobie Coetzee, Dr Neil Barnard, Mr Fanie van der Merwe were engaged in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a>their own strategy over and above what we were busy with, that was none of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a>my business. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a> Dr Neil Barnard was not obliged to report to me neither was Mr Fanie </p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a>van der Merwe, neither was Mr Kobie Coetzee. It was none of my business, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a>did not want to know they were reporting to Mr P W Botha on that issue and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a>that was how it functioned. My job was to manage the state of emergency and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a>all the information I had to have to manage the state of emergency I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a>entitled to and over and above that I was not entitled to that. I operated as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a>Deputy Minister and function under regulated or (help my met die - Engels </p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a>man) regulations, delegated powers and regulations, over and above that it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a>not my line function. I was not in the authority to detain people or to release </p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a>people, and in that sense I didn't know and I did not want to know, because I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a>was charged to do something else, to manage the state of emergency and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a>national management system and I did that.  And therefore I am saying in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a>conclusion there was such a policy, Mr Pik Botha mentioned it yesterday as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a>well, that was a statement of fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Mr Wessels, you have also had the benefit of being present </p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a>for the last two days, you weren't present at the previous hearings, but in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>essence some of the testimony that we have heard has been to the effect that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a>there were certain policy guidelines formulated and there was obviously never </p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a>any intention that that should mean, that unlawful action should flow from it. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a>Unlawful actions did flow from those policy frameworks were in consequence </p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a>of misinterpretations and we have had discussion about how to interpret the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a>word elimineer and so on and so forth. I don't want to get into a semantic </p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a>debate about it. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a> The Security forces fought a war in the country and in certain respects </p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a>they fought a dirty war and that is evident from a number of the amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a>applications, the benefit of having fought that war including the dirty aspects </p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a>was that the revolution as envisaged did not occur, the revolutionaries did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a>wrest power from the National Party government as it was. Is it not too much </p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a>to expect that the Commission should accept that this benefit, that benefit was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a>merely the happy result of a set of mistaken interpretations, a coincidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a>MR WESSELS:   I must tell you I will not try to duck the answer, to duck the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a>question but I have difficulty in fully comprehend that and I won't blame you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a>for the way you formulated it, I will, maybe I am not on top of the question, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a>but the following occurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a> It was a dirty war on all sides. I sat in discussions where I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a>defending, so to speak, people who were allies of the government, I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a>referring to councillors, and no, I am not arguing the legitimacy, the non-</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a>legitimacy of the fact, they were councillors and what had been done to them </p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>and I had listened to arguments where they had told me in the presence of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>others what they thought of our policies. None of them were supporters of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>apartheid, and yet they were subjected to but fierce intimidation. Serious </p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>intimidation. And I sat alongside South African policemen being accused by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a>them for not protecting them.  So that was the predicament, that was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a>cleftstick, John Citizen found himself in. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a> I have somebody who has just been decorated for reporting on the work </p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a>of this Commission and somebody I hold in high esteem who had first </p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a>educated me about this predicament, John Citizen being called upon to not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a>disclose the whereabouts of an infiltrator, a revolutionary, being forced to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a>remain silent by those people who wanted him to play a specific role, and yet </p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a>on the same side also being the subject of attacks by the security forces for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a>not disclosing that particular event, that was the difficulty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a> But let me not run away from the issue, the issue is the following, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a>Chappies Klopper whom I happen to know, Chappies Klopper told me who he, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a>why and how he and others had attacked the house of Ivor Jenkins, and I said, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a>why did you do that, and I speak very good Afrikaans, just like Markgraaf, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a>have a very good repertoire of Afrikaans words to explain my anger, I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a>really the hell in, and I asked him, why did you do that?  And he said well we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a>did it because we thought they were giving you a hard time, not me </p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a>personally, the government.  How and why did he believe that?  Because we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a>had been making those speeches, the speeches Mr Pik Botha had referred to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a>yesterday, National Party rallies. If you wanted to have an applause from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a>gathering, then you must see how we try and mobilise people and how we stir </p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a>them up at meetings, we will really speak to them and get them to react, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a>will climb every mountain in this country.....used by us and the Chappies </p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a>Kloppers' of the world interpreted what we were saying, he thought it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a>just, it was legitimate to instil the fear of hell into Ivor Jenkins and others by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a>attacking his house and shooting his house and never ever did I or anybody </p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a>give such, never did I, let me speak for myself, did I give such an instruction, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a>never ever, and that is what I said, can I condone that, but I cannot shy away </p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a>from the fact, that those men and woman and I were on the same side and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a>was the difficulty we're in. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a> That is why I am not sure, I mean we run glibly over this, I am not sure </p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a>whether the people of South Africa and I say this with respect, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a>Commissioners and others appreciate that silent feeling of relief when the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a>epilogue was agreed to. There are people who are picking it up, but that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a>epilogue was not agreed to at the World Trade Centre in November of 1993, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a>but it, we had to go the extra mile, we had to go to the Cape of Good Hope </p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a>Centre in December of 1993 to Cape Town, that is how difficult it was to get </p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a>that in, that is why I said I will be continuing tomorrow, I have a lot to say Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a>Chairman - now I am not biased against this Commission, I think my conduct, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a>my interaction with you displays that, but I implore you, don't squander the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a>opportunity that we negotiated for you, in the epilogue, to ensure that this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a>County will be at peace with itself after you have done your job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a>MR GOOSEN:   Mr Chairperson, I have no further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, both of you, we have had an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a>extraordinary two days.  We were very deeply frustrated that especially the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a>military had not come forward for us to be able to know more about what had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a>happened, why it had happened, and I mean, we had thought that this hearing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a>was going to provide us with some of the answers that we were looking for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a>about accountability and so on. I think we have gone beyond that.  We are still </p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a>going to have to try and establish, I mean we have got researchers and these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a>people who are going to be trying to establish facts and we are still going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a>have our meeting with Mr P W Botha.  You indicated earlier that you believed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a>that it was important that your leaders should have been here to help you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a>become a team.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a> But I think that anyone listening to yourselves is not going to go away </p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a>with, well, they were fussing over this, they were fussing over that, it is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a>you have come out and stood, well almost naked, figuratively, and it is a very </p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a>humbling thing, it is a very humbling thing for us in the Commission, it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a>very humbling, because some of the things that have happened in the two </p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a>years that we have been together, have been quite extraordinary, and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a>regard what has happened in these two days in different ways, but especially </p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a>the remarkable candour that you have displayed is something that I think </p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a>doesn't happen, it's not happened anywhere else.   I said when we sit here </p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a>sometimes we forget, I mean, that you were the government, you were running </p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a>the show and now you are coming to give account to us who many of us were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a>regarded in that dispensation as really nothing or worse, I mean, enemies to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>neutralised.  And I just want to give thanks, I want to give thanks for our </p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>country, for our people, I want to give thanks that you two young men should </p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a>have, I mean, the honesty that you have demonstrated is, it doesn't come </p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a>easily to anyone of us, I think and it must be at some cost to yourselves, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a>we want to give thanks and believe, I mean we believe fervently that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a>contribution that you have made in the past, but the contribution that you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a>made today is going to be one that has a remarkable impact. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a> It is going to help give a momentum to this process of seeking to heal </p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a>our country, because we have been committed to the fact that we want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a>finish this thing quickly. The country can't keep sitting and sort of scratching </p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a>open the wounds, that's had to be done, but it is a phase that must pass so that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a>we can actually get down to the business of holding hands and saying I want </p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a>to make this country a great country.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a> The pain sometimes is that this could have happened so much earlier, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a>you know, but then, there is a wonderful little piece in the Bible which says, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a>"In the fullness of time, something happens in the fullness of time" we might </p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a>be impatient and say "why didn't it happen at that time? But the circumstances </p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a>were not ripe for it to happen. And I just hope you are aware that you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a>helped, I think, to pour balm on the wounds of very many by what you two and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a>to some extent the other two people have done, and I want to say thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a>  I want to thank my colleagues and our team over there and yourselves </p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a>over there and all of you that, now I understand a little bit actually why the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a>world looks on and marvels that you can sit there and that I can laugh with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a>you when you can laugh with me, as they say, but it can't be, and it is, it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a>happening and the miracle that they spoke of in 1994, I think God wants it to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a>persist in part for the sake of the world, because if we can do it here with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a>God's help and God's blessing and the prayers of so many around the world </p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a>and there is hope for Rwanda, Sierra Leone and all of those places. I want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a>pray.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a> God you are good and you do some extraordinary things in this Land.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a>We thank you for the privilege of being fellow-workers with you. We thank </p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a>you for those who have come forward yesterday and today and for the things </p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a>that have happened and we pray that these and others similar to this will </p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a>contribute to the healing of this traumatised of this wounded people, thank </p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a>you God. Amen.</p>
