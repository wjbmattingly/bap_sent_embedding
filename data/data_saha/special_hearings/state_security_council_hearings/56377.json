            "Good morning !  I want to welcome members of the public here today and Dr Neil Barnard. \n There are not many people to welcome.  It seems that the testimony that is being given in Johannesburg today has captured the minds of the, or the imagination of the press, but let me assure you that we are nevertheless very interested in what you have to say today,  and we are looking forward to a constructive two days of hearing.  I say two days because we hope to hear evidence this morning from Dr Barnard and this afternoon from General Magnus Malan and tomorrow from Mr PW Botha.  There is a possibility as Mr Botha has gone on record to say that he does not intend to comply with the subpoena, so there is a possibility that he will not be here tomorrow, and we may use tomorrow to continue evidence of Dr Barnard and General Malan if there are issues which we still have to cover.\n This hearing is a public hearing held in terms of Section 29 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, and it is a continuation of a hearing which was held in October this year in Johannesburg and in Cape Town and was postponed because of the inability of Mr Botha to be present through illness and the fact that General Malan was out of the country.  \nThe purpose of the hearing is to examine the role of the State Security Council particularly in the 1980's.  It is common cause that this Council exercised extensive influence over the Cabinet of the day and made recommendations to the Government on a broad range of Security related issues.  \n As I said earlier on we had hoped to hear evidence and we still do hope to hear evidence from the person who was Chair of that Council, State Security Council and State President Mr Botha, a position of enormous power and influence.  It is unfortunate that he has stated publicly that he does not intend to comply with the subpoena served on him.  He has gone on record to say that he does not intend to go on his knees before this Commission.  Of course he is not required to go on his knees and he is not even required to apologise to the Commission.  All he is required to do is to present himself here and to answer questions truthfully.  However we will until tomorrow morning when Mr Botha is due to appear before making any further comment in that regard. \nBefore we start I'm going to just briefly introduce members of the panel.\nOn my left Mr Ilan Lax of the Human Rights Violations Committee, a Committee Member.  Next to him Ms Glenda Wildschut a Commissioner on the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee.   I'm Richard Lyster, Commissioner, and on my right Mary Burton also a Commissioner.   \nDr Barnard was represented here today by Mr Albertyn from De Klerk and Van Gend and Mr Nick Treurnicht of the Cape Town Bar.  The evidence will be led by Advocate Chris MacAdam.  I think those are all the introductory comments I need to make.\nI understand that Dr Barnard wishes to make a, to read  an opening statement into the record and I think that we'll now get down to that immediately, unless there are any opening remarks that you would like  to make Mr Treurnicht.",

            "(sworn states)\nDR BARNARD\n\"I the undersigned Lucas Daniel Barnard declares  as follows. I am the Director General of the Provincial Administration of the Province of the Western Cape.\nOn the 14th of July 1979 I appeared before a Special Committee of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  The statement I made at the decision is attached as annexure LB.1.  To avoid duplication I refer to paragraph 2 in which my terms as Director of the National Intelligence Service and the Department of Constitutional Development and the circumstances of why I left this department are detailed.  \nI make this statement against the following background:\nOn the 17th of September 1997 I was served with a written notice according to Section 29 to appear on the 16th of October before the Commission in Johannesburg.  According to this notice my evidence was required for the purposes of promoting the motives and the perspectives of key figures serving on the State Security Council.  The Commission required specific information regarding abuse of these people, regarding the conflicts of the past and the roles they've played in this regard.  This appears from paragraphs 1a and b from the first notice, which was served on me.\nMore specifically the Commission wants to know whether any discussions of the State Security Council authorised illegal activities or whether it could be regarded as authorising illegal activities. \nFor the purpose of the evidence required from me, I'm referring to the first set of documents, it is impossible to give a complete perspective with only referring to the documents applied to me.  \nI want to emphasise as I've done previously, that there are many documents containing information, which support all the perspectives.  My legal representatives told me that requests for the Commission to obtain these documents were of no avail.  This hampered the preparation of this statement and I had to rely on my memory.  \nBefore I refer to the specific incidences required, I want to emphasise the following.  \nOn the 14th of July 1997, I accepted responsibility for the actions of the people of National Intelligence while I was head and I'm also doing it regarding the activities of the people of the State Security Council.  \nThere are certain organisations and individuals which is not in my favour because of their own political agendas and they said that while I was member of National Intelligence that I was involved in illegal activities.  This is why I want to refute these allegations.  \nWhile I was in Durban, I assumed that this was not the Commission's view.  You are not able to make an informed evaluation regarding the work of National Intelligence without referring to all the documents, which were generated by all the parties party to this conflict.  You should keep in mind that the NI documentation was the result of consultation and administrative processes. For the purposes of  formulating  an informed perspective, the Commission should also refer to these documents.  \nI wish to refer to specific incidences for which my evidence is required.  \nDuring that period under discussion as Head of National Intelligence and also Head of the Department of Constitutional Development I made certain inputs at the State Security Council.  I cannot comment on subjective matters such as the motives or perspectives of other individual role-players in the State Security Council and I'm withholding these views then.  \nMy own views are as follows.  To put my evidence in the following context I will use the following details.  My views regarding the strategic role of the State Security Council, the various structures and also the role and task of the NI during this period;  furthermore, actions of the Government of the day in regarding the security situation with reference to actions in neighbouring States or other States; actions regarding internal opposition groups or liberation movements, and the role of National Intelligence in negotiation politics.  \nFirstly then, the strategic security situation in the period under discussion.   \nThis statement is concerned with a period, the beginning of 1980 to April 1994.  The conflict which South Africa experienced during those times was not a new phenomenon. Before the colonial times there was also violent conflict in South Africa.  It was not exclusively related to South Africa.  The struggle for political power was underlying this conflict.  The conflict and the way it was solved here, and elsewhere moved away from the conventional forces, which waged war in a conventional way, and in this time the difference between the soldier and the civil person disappeared.  \nIn South Africa the conflict was a result of the fact that various population groups were excluded from political decision-making - \"who\" decided \"who\" should govern the country, and how it should be done.  \nThis conflict had a long historical beginning and this was because the so-called Coloureds, were excluded from the Convention in 1908 to 1910, and the establishment of the ANC in 1912.  The initial peaceful protest developed into conflict where violence was used to realise certain purposes, and that was in the 1960's.  \nIn the 1980's the position was that the White minority ruled the country while other population groups were not part of the political process. During that time the ANC, SACP alliance and other revolutionary groups were on all terrains involved in a struggle against the Central Government.  There is a lot of documented evidence from that time to the effect that these groups, that it wanted to change the dispensation in South Africa and would use all various efforts to establish a new political order.  Attempt to do this should be -  because this struggle moved to all terrains of life and the idea of total onslaught developed, otherwise it was not a legend but it was a hard reality with which all South Africans were confronted.  These people who did not participate in the political processes, wanted to bring about the fall of the Government, by using a Total Onslaught through undermining, by violence, mobilisation of the masses to make the country ungovernable, international isolation to bring South Africa, especially on an economic way on its knees, and the development of alternative structures, internally and overseas. to establish an alternative Government.  \nThe application of this brought a tragic framework, nothing was left out of consideration.  \nOn the military area, people who had to bring the Government to a fall, were trained world-wide.  \nIntelligence structures were developed which had to gather security information.  \nOn economic terrain, boycotts and sanctions were orchestrated against South Africa.  \nOn a social level and especially in the way of churches and in schools mobilisation was enforced, and said that no education was possible before political liberation.\nThe previous Government to use all possible methods, should be seen against the background of this total onslaught to get all the power.  For each and every offensive assault a defence mechanism had to be found. This required planning, strategies etc in order to curb these onslaughts.  Except for the factors that I have referred to, the following cardinal and very important factors have to be taken into account in the judging of the Government's counter-revolutionary strategy.  \nThe realisation that the use of weapons was impossible, brought about strategic concepts of Total Onslaught and total counter-strategy.  This included that other areas, other terrains of life also had to be included.  \nThe SSC was motivated by the concern that a revolutionary war would also be successful in South Africa as in other countries, including in South Africa's neighbouring States.  At that stage the concept of revolutionary war had the flavour of being unconquerable.  \nThe conflicts in Southern Africa were not without blood-pouring and the concern of many of the members of the SSC at that stage, my own as well, was that such a development in South Africa had to be prevented.  At that stage there was terror in the cities, there were motor bombings and bombs planted, without any concern as to who were blown up like in Northern Ireland and in Latin America.  \nAt that stage also planes were also hijacked and it was general knowledge that ..(indistinct) in the city was creating panic in citizens.  There were also other factors that the SSC had to take into account.  \nIt was throughout, my point of view that the conflict would not be able to be countered and could not be ended if there was continued violence or political  (en die ekonomiese aanwend)\nThe co-ordination and economic use of manpower and the security structures as well as the welfare departments were necessary.  \nThere were great discrepancies between people with regards to the use of the Security Forces on the one hand, and the attempt to uplift people socially and economically, especially the military and the police, initially, pleaded for a renewed attempt in that direction.  While welfare departments wanted more socio-economic upliftment attempts, the SSC came to the conclusion that in a revolutionary conflict the battle for the hearts and minds of people was more important than the physical battle on the security front.  It is clear from the policy documents, that the Commission made available to me. \nIn the late eighties members of the SSC spent more and more time in developing more effective methods to curb the political conflict in South Africa and the possibility of seeking process was very important.  The members of the SSC were throughout convinced that such a political settlement cannot be sought in chaos, but that the actions of the security forces had to bring about stability so that a political settlement process can be guaranteed that it will be in a peaceful way.  The members of the SSC were kept up to date by Intelligence publications and National Intelligence assessments as well as other documents that were given to them during these information meetings with regards to revolutionary organisations. The evaluation of such information from time to time took place.  \nIt was clear in these discussions that giving over was never an option and that the South African Government with the power at its command, had to protect the physical integrity of the State and its citizens, the structures of the Security Management System, and their tasks.  \nThe planning of the State's ability during this period to maintain security and stability in this period was the responsibility of the SSC and its sub structures.  \nIn paragraph 6.4 in my previous statement, referred to as annexure LDB.1, I discussed the background to the establishment of the SSC. As indicated there the existence of such a body was not unique in South Africa, and not only States, and also revolutionary movements also have these types of institutions.  I refer in this regard to the ANC's political Military Council and the National Working Committee.  \nThe SSC was under the political power of the Government of the day.  Possibly as a result of the fact, that, because of the Total Onslaught policy, the idea of National Security was an all encompassing concept, and the strategy, and the constitutional, economic, social, also entailed the security terrains, and it was suggested that the SSC was actually the Government of the day.  \nOn the 30th January 1984 the Prime Minister reacted as follows in Parliament, and I quote -\n\"When the SSC now takes certain decisions, the Chairman takes it personally to the Cabinet and presents it to the Cabinet.  The Cabinet still has the right to discuss any decision of the SSC and to disregard it.\"\nIn a press statement, which was supplied by the Secretary of the SSC on the 21st September 1983 it was said that a decision taken by the SSC had to be finally approved by the Cabinet. To the best of my knowledge and as far as I can remember the SSC functioned as follows: \nIt gathered twice per week under the chairmanship of the State President.  If necessary, special meetings were held.  I remember that every year, one week before Christmas such special meetings were held in order to discuss the security of the country during the Christmas season.  Special meetings were also held to discuss the security actions, which was regarded as important for the security and the management of the State.  The institution and the relief of States of emergency was also decided on special meetings.  Meetings of the SSC were also attended by the permanent members as determined by statute.  Additional members were co-opted.  \nIt was also used to use other officials or to invite them from time to time to attend various meetings and to inform the SSC to the best of their ability and to use experts.  Matters which were discussed on a specific State and which were regarded as relevant to security were contained on these agendas.\nThis was divided into the following categories: the necessity of physically security action to avoid threats to the Government from overseas and internally, furthermore, general relationships between States and the consequent security implications for South Africa.  In this regard the situation in the previous South West Africa during those years, took a lot of time from the SSC.  \nFurthermore, the increasing international isolation of South Africa on diplomatic, economic, cultural, academic and sport terrains and specifically the role of economic sanctions and boycotts, as well as the strategies to circumvent this.  \nOther matters such as the supplying of passports and various transport matters to people were regarded as politically sensitive people, as the supply of visas to opponents of the Government.  \nIn my opinion the discussions in the SSC were held on a professional and high level.  The agendas and the minutes of these meetings are available and give enough information in this regard.   \nThe administrative support of the SSC was provided by a body called the Secretariat of the SSC, and this Secretariat's functions entailed the following: It served as a gathering point of all departmental inputs from about 15 inter-departmental committees, from the Working Committee to which is referred in paragraph 9.6.  The processing of information to enable the SSC to handle accordingly.  And also keeping SSC minutes and conveying decisions of the SSC to the people who had to execute these orders or decisions.  The administrative activities of the SSC was done by the Working Committee of the SSC.  The meetings of this Committee was important for the SSC and sometimes ad hoc meetings were held to discuss crises and to provide advice to the SSC.  \nThe members of this Working Committee were those officials to which are referred in Section 4 of the Act on Security Information and the State Security Council number 64 of 72, as well as other Heads of departments, which according to the circumstances were necessary for the preparatory administrative work of the SSC.  \nAs in the case of the SSC itself, many middle level managers and other experts were invited from time to time, to inform the members of the SSC regarding certain matters.  There was also an extensive system of inter departmental sub committees of the Working Committee.  \nCertain State Departments were grouped according to line function activities to give expert advice to the Working Committee.  For example, there was an inter-departmental Committee regarding the control of aliens, and this provided advice regarding matters pertaining to the supply of passports and visas, and the illegal stay of aliens in South Africa.  The contents of the preparatory documentation which served as input at these committees is of great importance for the development of an informed and balanced historical perspective regarding this specific period and the views of various role players, regarding events in South Africa.  \nI had no access to that.  If that means that the Commission does not intend to refer to that, important information will not be taken into consideration for their report. \nThe co-ordination of the Intelligence activities of the South African information community was co-ordinated by a body that was known as the Co-ordinating  Intelligence Committee in short, CIC.  In paragraph 10.1.6 and 10.1.10, I deal with this in more detail.  \nAfter the proclamation of the General State of Emergency on the 12th June 1986, the security management of the country was bettered by the National Security Management System in order to make it more effective. The existence of this management system must be placed in the following historical perspective.  \nDuring the mid-eighties, the South African police did not have the necessary manpower, funds and sometimes expertise, as well as training and management in order to counter the internal revolutionary onslaught successfully.  The South African Defence Force, however, did have the necessary manpower, the equipment and an officer corps who had management skills but they were primarily responsible for the defence of the State's territory.  In order to counter this dilemma a thought was mentioned to create a new force also called a Neutral or an In-between Force between the Police and the Defence Force.  Such forces do exist in States like, France, Spain and Italy.  I recall that there were even discussion documents at the Working Committee regarding the possible development of such a force in which it was referred to as a Third Force.  \nFor practical purposes, I was at all times against the implementation of such a force and I was of the opinion that the South African police had to be made stronger rather.  Addendum K to the bundle of documents that the Commission made available to me, reflects this.  \nEven though there was never such a decision to bring about such a force, many people continued in their attempts to put the bringing about of such a force in front of the SSC's door.  During the mid-eighties it was clear that this conflict could not be alleviated by means of the use of the Security Forces and that the other departments, the Welfare Departments were better co-ordinated or had to be better co-ordinated to better the social economic circumstances of all South Africans.  \nIn the terminology of the revolutionary conflict this entailed that the battle for the hearts and the minds of the people had to be won.  \nVarious departments with critically important welfare functions, however, had a shortage of funds and skills.  Accordingly a better co-ordinated management mechanism had to be developed in order to use funds and skills optimally.  Against the background of the above two considerations, a Vice Ministy of Law and Order and Defence was created who was responsible to make sure that on security terrain the Defence Force as well as the Police co-ordinated in a harmonious way, and that the security forces and the welfare departments could be managed in a co-ordinated way in order to counter the revolutionary onslaught in an effective way. This system required a network of Management Committees in various functional areas and on various hierarchy levels.  Certain committees functioning on National level were backed by committees on Provincial and/or Regional levels and sometimes even on Local level.  This system initially encountered some resistance. \nDepartments and Administrations regarded this as an interference in their responsibilities and others were of the opinion that it was an attempt to militarise the State.  The Management Committee was a well-meant attempt to gain an integrated use of manpower, funds and skills against the revolutionary onslaught to make this possible.  It was not sinister and is definitely not unique.  \nExperts on revolutionary warfare agree with each other that a management mechanism of all the State's forces was and is, a very important aspect of successful counter-revolutionary action.\nNext, the role and task of the National Intelligence in this\ntime.  During this time that is concerned in this report, I was Head of NI and my contribution to the SSC was in that perspective.  My view regarding the Central Intelligence Services like NI was throughout that it is in main in contrast to other departmental Intelligence organs, and like for example Military Intelligence Services or Police Intelligence Services.  It had to deal with a universal Intelligence task which is to gather Intelligence regarding happenings and events that related to undermining the State power.  Intelligence, Security Intelligence is only useful if it can be weighed up in an expert way and if it can be given to the political decision-makers in time.  It is fundamentally important that such information must be given to the political decision makers in time and one of the problems of Intelligence Services world-wide is to give these political decision makers the information in time and to help them to understand the importance thereof.  The evaluation of Security.  The evaluation of this information, it could not be coloured by personal ideas, it would be very short sighted.  No Government or Intelligence Service can in the long run use the security information for political or ideological point scoring.  Intelligence Services are responsible for giving Intelligence and information to other State Departments which can be an embarrassment to the State departments and which sometimes has nothing to do with the political role plays ideological  convict.  Because of their unique manpower and capabilities of the Intelligence services they are sometimes used for secondary Intelligence responsibilities.  Intelligence services should thus be act in the fullest confidence and have the ability to covert diplomacy, confidential discussions, the handling of security in the State dispensation and other forms of clandestine activities on military, economic, constitutional, social and other terrains and to handle all this.\n The coordination of the information or the Intelligence communities activities during this at time to which  I'm referring  is done by the CIC which met bi-weekly under my chairmanship.\n The various roles of the National Intelligence and the Military Intelligence division of the South African Army, the Security Force of the South African Police and the Department of Foreign Affairs was determined during an occasion known as the Simon's Town meeting.  Members of the Intelligence Community kept to their various areas of works and they agreed not to spy on one another.  \n The CIC, like Intelligence Services world-wide, worked on a \"had to know basis\", according to which individuals were only concerned with the information they required to execute their various tasks.  This compartmentalisation principle was for security reasons so when certain sources and information could not be harmed and if a member from one information service would become a member of a hostile information service.  \n Activities of the CIC was supported by a system of sub-committees which did the necessary preparatory work.  These sub-committees were amongst others, firstly, Covert Information Gathering, then Open Information Gathering, then Technical sub- committees, then Evaluation sub-committees which was later known as the Branch National Interpretation, then, Counter Espionage sub-committee and lastly, Intelligence Security sub-committee.  \n Although CIC did it's utmost best to allow the Intelligence community of South Africa to co-operate in a co-ordinated way, there were certain overlappings in activities and there were strong differences of opinion regarding security Intelligence in general.  Difference in opinions serve a purpose because this sometimes lead to new improved insights and consequently the CIC presented the participants the ability to give inputs regarding various critical matters.  But political decision makers required consensus opinions and sometimes we had the dilemma that forced consensus, sometimes required that it didn't refect the standpoint of anybody at all.  \n During my previous appearance I've already said, and today again, and I've referred to the annual National Intelligence Evaluations. There is little, if any, documentation in South Africa available, which gives such a complete and balanced picture of what happened during the specific time on the security terrain.  I want to reiterate that the objectives of the Commission and the openness or transparency which should be part of a democratic society would not be served or would be served by a continued denial or negligence to provide those Intelligence evaluation for public discussion or evaluation.  The fact that I could not get access to that for the purposes of preparing this statement is a pity.  More important is that the Commission would not do what it has to do if for the purposes of this report did not supply or present those documents to Parliament.  The contents of those documents proves above all doubt that the Intelligence community and the SSC's structures were not an evil organisation, as said by some.  \n Taking the Commission's objectives into consideration, it will not be unreasonable not to investigate or report on a subject which is important today to refer selectively only to smaller parts of the large amount of available documentation, especially if those documents are not made available.  \n I am further of the opinion that the formation of a balanced perspective regarding the security events of the 1980's is only possible if the differences between the departments  which were involved in the security process are taken into consideration.  I refer here to the NI, the South African Army, the South African Police, the Department of Foreign Affairs and to a lesser degree the Department of Justice, Finance and Internal Affairs and the other State Departments which are known as the Welfare Departments.  \n National Intelligence which had no executive powers, the main task was the gathering, the processing and communication of National Security Intelligence.  A study of all security documentation of NI from the beginning of the 1980s to the beginning of 1992 shows that one fundamental Intelligence fact was consequently emphasised by NI, that was namely that the call of South Africa's security problematics was political of nature and could only be solved through a constitutional negotiated process.  Based on this point of departure, the standpoint was maintained that the security forces could maintain order and stability on security area to provide the basis for a political solution.  \n In the case of the South African Defence Force in general and the division Military Intelligence specifically, the emphasis was placed on the military street from our neighbouring and other States.  There was a way of thinking in the Defence Forces emphasising the standpoint of a foremost defence strategy.  This strategy according to the classical theory of international politics and strategy was based on the supposition that buffer zones between opposing States or even groups of States had to be developed to serve as a basis for inter-State power basis.  \n Against this background the Defence Force was militarily involved and worried about Angola and Mozambique and sometimes also Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland.  In depth debate about the main focus of the budgets of those years was not strange and the differences in opinion of the preferences which military matters had above the social, economic and development of the whole population often occurred.  Because of the expertise of the Defence Force to which I've already referred, it had often happened that the Defence Force moved outside the typically military terrain and was often asked to undertake these type of activities.  This position sometimes led to tension between the Security Department and sometimes between the Defence Force and the Welfare Departments.  As the conflict grew internally the Defence Force was used more often and consequently it led to intensification of various differences.  \n The South African police was responsible for maintaining law and order in South Africa.  By the end of the 1980's they had this task, unenviable task, to try and keep this country stable, while most of the citizens did not accept the political dispensation, and the revolutionary movements tried to destroy it in any possible way.  Taken into consideration also that the police had a serious shortage in manpower and funds and sometimes also modern managerial abilities. the extent of this dilemma becomes very clear.\n The Department of Foreign Affairs had against a strong attack to isolate South Africa had to maintain diplomatic relationships.  This department was thus involved or worried about the influence which cross-border operations and economic actions against South Africa, by our neighbouring States would have on inter-State relationships.  Members of this department had the standpoint that security activities in South Africa  should be of such a nature that it would not lead to further isolation or economic boycotts.  In this way the department contributed to it, that the voice of international thought, morality and influence could still be heard and was taken into consideration in the SSC and other security structures.  \n Late in the 1980's the welfare departments played an increasingly important role.  It was especially when the thought was developed and became acceptable that a political negotiation was the only way out, and that could happen in a stable, social, economic environment.  \n You must take into consideration that the security management system, in the 1980's was well informed and was effective, and it was this system which laid the foundation for the peaceful transition to a democratic political dispensation.  You must not allow that atrocities by individual members of the security forces which because of that gruesome nature, had an influence on all.  This must not influence your evaluation of the bigger picture.  \n You cannot make a rule of the exception.  These exceptions are very important and it must be emphasised and the perception exists that it's not true to reality.  You have to be true to what you should do and you should put this right.\nWorld-wide it had happened that some departments, sometimes acted in subjective line function.  It often happened that departments interpreted decisions to give themselves the advantage of an interpretation which would enforce their own position and their control over forces and manpower.  This leaves scope for individuals to promote their own careers or because of other considerations to manipulate instructions or decisions for their own benefit.  \n It is also true that  in large bureaucratic institutions such as the public sector in a State where hundreds and thousands of people work in the public sector, that  there is a danger that decisions and instructions are not formulated, conveyed or interpreted in a correct way.  And also a degenerating security situation associated with attempts to undermine the power of the State and this leads to a greater pressure in the work situation and there can be certain misunderstandings. \n Actions of the Government of the day, in the first place, actions in neighbouring States and other countries.  I accept that my input is required regarding the emphasised parts of the documents presented to me as Annexures A to L .  Before I do this, I give my viewpoints regarding activities in neighbouring States.  \n You would like to know according to me, in this context, you would like to know as far as I think whether the SSC authorised illegal cross border activities, held discussions or made decisions which could be interpreted as it had authorised these illegal cross-border activities.  Before the 1980's, but especially during that time, the revolutionary resistance organisations of South Africa's neighbouring States was used as a basis for logistical support; training for revolutionary fighters which had to infiltrate South Africa or to source these people, and it was also used as a safe haven for revolutionary people.  The correctness of this statement leaves no space for dispute.  \n Revolutionary movements, cross-border activities against civil and other targets in South Africa became a threat for the security of the State and the citizens.  These States which allowed that the revolutionary movements which became part of these activities and which operated from their countries also became part of the contravention of International Law.  Included in the state of these States to respect the sovereignty of the other States it is also their duty not to allow or to promote terrorist activities from their soil and to do all steps which might be necessary to prevent that.\n In this regard I would like to point out that States who were members, or in which members of revolutionary organisations were, were in any case warned repeatedly not to allow their territory to be used for those purposes.  Nevertheless, the members of the revolutionary organisations co-ordinated violent cross-border actions from these neighbouring states, and it was necessary for the State to defend itself in certain actions and to act against these people in neighbouring states.  In terms of International Law as I understand it, self-defence actions against such members of revolutionary organisations who were present  in neighbouring states is allowed.  I cannot recall any decision or discussion of the SSC in terms of which an unlawful cross-border operation was authorised or which could reasonably be interpreted as being a decision to allow unlawful operations.   NI and myself also was of the opinion that cross-border actions were authorised by International Law and was in principle not against it.  It was sometimes expected from NI to give its opinion on intended cross-border security actions.  This was not in all cases done.  The fact that during some of these operations certain so-called non-combatants died, it was an unfortunate occurrence due to the vagueness of the border between soldiers and citizens.  \n I have to emphasise though, that members of the security forces, never aimed their actions against innocent civilians.  To summarise I would like to reiterate that cross- border self defence actions is a natural and a necessary result of revolutionary conflict and is authorised by International Law.  From a strategic point of view it would be extremely naive to allow armed terror groups in neighbouring States and to allow them to go on with their revolutionary work and their blood letting.\n In addendum A  of the bundle of documents which was included in the first notice, my commentary was required with regards to paragraph 8 thereof.  My commentary is as follows:  After the conclusion of the Lancaster house accord people were sent to report on the events in Zimbabwe, Mr Neil van Heerden from Foreign Affairs and Admiral W.N. Du Plessis of Division Military Intelligence and a member of NI were also there.  After they came back, they reported to a committee, of which I was the Head, they reported on what they heard and I informed the SSC with regards to their reports as is clear from the addendum.  \n One of the various aspects that was mentioned was that there was an attempt on the life or an planned attempt on the life of Mr Mugabe of the then Rhodesian security forces.  If I recall correctly part of the suggestion that was discussed by the SSC was that if such an attempt, if it was successful would have very bad consequences and would be very negative.  I gathered that my comment is necessary on this document because somebody is of the opinion that paragraph 7.8 thereof indicates that the SSC is involved in an assassination attempt on Mr Mugabe.  This paragraph and the background facts as explained above shows that such an inference is completely unfounded.  \n Actions with regards to internal liberation movements, revolutionary groupings and resistance movements.  In addendum G and J in the bundle of documents of the first notice, there is a reference to strategy number two, named Strategy to the countering of the African National Congress and strategy number 44, National strategy against revolutionary war in South Africa.  This is about the planning of the safety structures against the revolutionary onslaught.  The two documents offer a proper general view of thoughts on internal resistance groups of the security structures at that stage.  There's no doubt that revolutionary resistance movements, especially since the mid '80's planned each and every plan and executed these plans with a view to make the State ungovernable, and in that way to lay a foundation for a process of revolutionary taking over of power.  Examples of this are - an attempt of rolling mass action, to muster resistance in each and every sector of civil life; attempts by labour unions to destabilise the work force and to disable the economy and to make the country ungovernable.  Furthermore the stabilisation of existing Government structures in mainly traditional black areas; furthermore, attacks on members of the security forces mainly in traditional black areas and also on their families; furthermore, the planning and execution of rent boycotts, the non-payment of lease and service charges which would make social economic development impossible and would in many cases neutralise it.  The organisation of the use of consumer boycotts and the often brutal intimidation of the people who would not take part.  The intimidation of Government structures in Transkei, Ciskei, Venda, and Bophuhatswana as well as structures of the then three house parliament.  \n Furthermore, the use of the liberation theology in churches; furthermore the creation of non-government organisations which would in each and every terrain of life put up resistance and orchestrate financial help from foreign goverments, welfare organisations, banks, church, universities, city councils etc.  In this comprehensive organisation of internal resistance climate, the UDF and later also the MDM and various other organisations like the PAC, AZAPO, and the SACP and others had a very important planning and co-ordinating role.  Against the background of this comprehensive internal and foreign revolutionary onslaught against the then Government, various security and welfare steps were taken to counter this onslaught.  \n The exercise of main responsibility of any Government which is to maintain an effective Government and administration of the country to guarantee the security of the inhabitants.  As a perusal of the documents will indicate the strategy that was developed by the SSC in the '80's, caused a security management system to be placed or to be developed that would prevent South Africa to fall into the clutches of a war.  \n The minutes of the SSC in the late 1980's and early 1990's shows unequivocally that the SSC during those years were full time involved on a full time basis with discussion of methods to change the social economic circumstances of all South Africans, and to prevent the possibility of a bloody revolution.  \n Secondly the planning and implementation of a political agreement process in a milieu of optimal security stability to ensure a peaceful transition.  This process was not without problems.  \n It is well known that reactionary members of the security forces and the welfare departments sometimes acted without, outside their mandates in the execution of these strategies. It is also true that instructions and mandates were sometimes vague and were communicated cruelly.  It can  also not be denied that members of the public sector had deeply seated and subjected personal convictions and sometimes that led to very serious activities which have been brought under the Commission's attention.  Such deeds, atrocities which had been done on both sides cannot be ignored, but you must not allow that, that should be the norm.\n And the full truth of the 1980's should be presented.  The truth is not that the South African history's course was determined by those on both sides who were involved in various atrocities on both sides.  The peaceful transition to a democratic system was possible because of the concerted attempts of those people who wanted a peaceful negotiated process.  The truth, as I've tried to indicate, was that the SSC and their sub-structures played an incisive role to make the present democracy in South Africa possible.  \n This, I as a previous statutory member of the SSC, unequivocally say and I'm going to attempt to illustrate it shortly with referring to NI activities in the realisation of what I regarded as the strategy of the SSC.  Then the role of the NI in discussions with ANC leaders and also the development of management mechanisms for politics in South Africa.  \n What I'm presenting in this regard must not be seen against a background as certain attempts to refer to the negotiated politics of the 1980's.  What I've seen about this is superficial and it contains many wrong facts and interpretations and assumptions.  I am not going to try to give a complete discussion of those moments in the political process, or in this political settlement process in which NI and I myself were involved.  I still refer to main historical notes regarding my own actions during that time to provide the required perspective regarding my views during that specific period in the search for and the eventual achievement of a political settlement in South Africa.  \n NI during the 1980's in the security structures and elsewhere was of the opinion that South Africa's problems would only be solved successfully through political negotiation and settlement.  South Africa's core problem was according to NI political of nature.  No military action would result in a continued settlement in South Africa.  In the security community of those years this was not a popular view. To make a political settlement in South Africa possible, according to me, the true political leaders of the revolutionary resistance movements in South Africa had to be negotiated with and the question, was the question, who were those leaders?    And in which way during this revolutionary climate in South Africa, how could these discussions be held?   Because of the political implications of such discussions, it was necessary that it had to be held very confidentially.  Because of  NI's unique ability to have these discussions on a confidential level and also the degree of confidentiality which we had with the State president P.W. Botha, NI during the initial reconnaissance phase could undertake these type of discussions. There was nothing sinister about that, that I and other NI members were part of the negotiating process.  Also Mr Mandela and the ANC wanted to keep these discussions confidential.  \n And I during the start of this process of settlement politics and they took the standpoint that only the State and its organs in the final instance would have to undertake these negotiations, and the execution of this process.  And we took a standpoint against the attempts of economic leaders, academics, church leaders, cultural leaders to act as facilitators.    This point of view was that such persons did not have political responsibilities and this could not bear the brunt of the political results of the discussions.  \n Very early during these discussions with Mr Mandela, we reached the agreement that the political settlement process in South Africa between the South African goverment and the liberation movements had to be negotiated and that facilitators from overseas would not be used in a manipulating role.  \n During discussions with Mr Mandela in May 1988 in the Pollsmoor prison in Cape Town, after we had been planning that for a whole year. I remember that in the next year, next years, approximately 48 discussions took place and some of them took 8 to 9 hours.  The discussions with Mr  Mandela led to the widely published meeting between Botha and Mandela in Tynhuis, and  this led to it that a process could be institutioned to enable the further planning of a negotiating process.  \n Concurrent with this and when Mr De Klerk became head of the government and his important February debate in Parliament for clandestine meetings with the external wing of the ANC under the leadership of Mbeki took place in Europe.  In such a way planning was done to manage the political settlement process in South Africa.  The rest of what happened afterwards is not important regarding the purposes of the perspectives, which are required from me.  \n I want to say, that if the real facts regarding, the political settlement process in South Africa, had to be recorded as true and as objectively as possible and to show that it was historically and correct to show that the SSC and its sub structures, and the individuals which had leadership roles in those structures, possibly played the most incisive role to make the political settlement process in South Africa a reality.  \n Lastly, encompassing perspective.  According to me a balance and equitable evaluation of the role of the security structures specifically, and events in South Africa in general during the 1980's and early 1990's should take the following points into consideration:  \n Firstly, there was an intense struggle on the one hand to maintain and, on the other hand to obtain political power, which was total in extent planning and the potential for conflict.   Furthermore, there was a total onslaught, which required extensive counter-measures that is undeniable.  During this conflict the various parties sometimes used unconventional and unorthodox methods to achieve their objectives.  \n Furthermore, the activities of the revolutionary movements which was sanctioned, presumably on the highest political level was, however, if you look at it from which point of view, they were illegal.  I refer specifically to attacks on innocent civil targets, which led to bloodshed and death.                                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAlthough the State Security Council, to the best of my knowledge, never authorised any legal activities it has now become known that some members of security forces became part of the most gruesome atrocities possible.  This was the tragic result which came after the intensification of the conflict. \n Please allow me to suggest that you should not against the background of the knowledge which you have now that people when they were involved in the struggle and things were at its worst that they did not know about these things.  \n I also want to suggest that you should take into consideration that the thousands of people who only did their duties according to their own insights and they have been humiliated because of these things which they now know about.  To brand them now, as that they were part of this, even to make it so difficult for them to still believe in their own human values, this would be a bad day for the national reconciliation  process.  \n Furthermore, in the \"stormingdrang\" of this revolutionary conflict representatives of all parties often neglected instructions, took the law into their own hands and sometimes they disregarded the boundaries of human activities. Such actions is not only part of the time of conflict in our country but it still remains a tragedy.  What we cannot deny, however, is that the security structures were used to  maintain a relatively stable community structure which made it possible to initiate the politically negotiation settlement process.  In a state of total anarchy it would not have been possible, and I want to reiterate my standpoint.  The SSC and its structures established the base for the new South Africa and the establishment of a structure, a climate and ability to make possible the activities of this Commission.",

What happened was that the principle, that is the document that you supplied me with, perhaps I should use it.  You supplied me with a document marked D.  It is about an Extraordinary Meeting where a point of discussion had been Lesotho.  I think it might be necessary for me to read to you what it says. It says\n\"Lesotho - Minister Botha reports that Lesotho was warned about the presence of ANC terrorists in the country. Only a refusing answer was received\".\n The next paragraph says:\n\"The Meeting approves that stricter actions be taken against Lesotho and that stricter measures be taken against Lesotho and six steps were envisaged.\n 1) Diplomatic negotiations; \n 2) Selective border control measures;\n 3) Intensifying these measures; \n 4) Practical closing of the border;\n 5) Repatriation of workers;\n6) What is here formulated as, violence across the  border.\n   Then there's a further paragraph which is important to the answer.  It's important to read this as well.  \n\"Furthermore, it must be publicised what the situation in South Africa's neighbouring countries is with regards to the latest terror actions against South Africa, initiatives have to be used.  The Meeting herewith approves that a strongly worded notice by Ministers Botha, Le Grange, Malan and Minister Malan with regards to the terror actions planned from the neighbouring States and executed from there had to be formulated and sent\".\nIt was approved after lunch by the Meeting and then it says:-\n\"Furthermore the Governments of neighbouring States had to be informed by telex\".\n If one reads through this specific example it is clear to me that the State Security Council acted in a very responsible way and in a responsible way maintained and wanted to manage it's relationships with Lesotho that it remained within the boundaries of inter-state politics.  It wanted to convince them by means of political pressure not to allow its territory to be used as safe houses.  The point of departure was supported that actions could be taken, that would be my interpretation of point number 6, the use of violence.  \n The principle therefore that the South African Government in principle would allow the Defence Forces to act against the military targets in neighbouring States was in principle approved by the State Security Council but individual actions was for security reasons never discussed by the State Security Council.",

Point number 11 thereof Airforce and Navy members, there's a paragraph that says, due to a lack of co-ordination Trevits was put in place in some year, if I remember correctly Trevits is an abbreviation for Counter Revolutionary Intelligence Task Force.  In the period, especially from 1986 when the emergency was declared, a body was put in place in the Intelligence community to co-ordinate the Intelligence regarding this revolutionary problem.  I cannot remember that Trevits ever was involved in foreign Intelligence but I understand that they did that on occasion.  I'm referring to a senior officer of NI, and I want to say NI never had any officers.  We were not an army structure and it should be referred here to NI. To the best of my knowledge we had a person and I think at certain stages more persons served on this body where the Intelligence was co-ordinated.  And what is stated furthermore in this statement is it was a kind of Intelligence database regarding targets in Lesotho or internally and there we would provide a specific input but the actions afterwards of those departments and the departments who acted accordingly had nothing to do with NI.",

We had to create a stable climate where this negotiated settlement could be reached.  \n There is no example where there are deeply divided communities in the world whether it's in the Middle East whether it's in Northern Ireland, it's not possible to get an answer to a problem if there is anarchy and that was also the point of view of the SSC that the situation should be stabilised.

This document of the Colonel, I think his rank is colonel, Colonel Snyman, I've read his submission, the reference you are making based on the paragraphs that the JMS was visited by political figures and during that stages they gave their opinions is based on Snyman's subjective opinion.  I think it was Mr Botha's management style and the management style of the security, it stood them in good stead that they did not stay in their offices in Cape Town and in Pretoria and looked at the increasing conflict from their ivory towers.  I think it was good for them that they made the time and that they sat down with the various officials, visited certain regions like in the Eastern Cape, talked to the officials who handled the situation who wanted to motivate them, who had to put their standpoint and to convince them that they had to make their contribution to stabilise the country.  I think it's the fact that political leaders participated in these discussions.  I was part of some of these discussions, not all of them, I'm not basing them on hearsay I was involved in some of these and not at one occasion Mr Botha and any of his people or officials said or referred to the elimination of people.  It was all about stabilising the situation, motivating people to stabilise the situation, motivating people to stabilise the situation.\n With respect I want to draw your attention that here in Snyman's submission there is no reference that an instruction had been given it's a perception he has in this regard.  I want to state it in a sentence which he started and he did not complete it.  On page 6 he started saying - \n\"The decision to neutralise these four activists by killing them could not be taken lightly\".\nand it caused a lot of problems for me and he  was struggling with his conscience.\n And then on page seven the long paragraph 4/5ths from the bottom - \n\"And then consequently I instructed them that some of the leadership elements from Pebco should be eliminated to stabilise the situation.\"\n  He said I gave the instruction.  My point of view is that the contribution of political leaders and senior officials did not have anything to do with the climate in which people had to be eliminated or killed.  It had to do with motivating people who during a difficult time and with limited human resources and with international isolation to make a contribution to stabilise the country to make a contribution.  But this Colonel Snyman at that stage was 58 years of age and he was the commanding officer of one of the most important security branches in the country.

Against the background of this history people from both sides of the political perspective had the wrong view, and this had an effect - did not only have an effect on people in the security forces but on all people.  A practical example : a few weeks ago in the Cape a person who was functioning on a third political level taking responsibility there, he was caught by people applying law and order and he said \"after Mandela disappears we will kill the white people like flies.\"  That was reported in the press.  This is an example from both sides that there are deeper inner feelings in people's hearts.

General van der Merwe says\n\"Mr Chairman, I have already testified before the Amnesty Committee and before the investigative team and I confirm that certain instructions were given with the approval of the Minister.  I do not doubt that at all that he would have informed the State Security Council\".\n I find that a very strange remark by van der Merwe.  He was a member of the SSC according to the statutes, and I personally was present at most meetings of the SSC and I find it really strange that he, who was also present, that he could think that the SSC could have been informed.  That's the first point I want to put. I do not agree with van der Merwe's point of view at this stage and that it was authorised that it was inferred, as he infers.  \n Now back to page 21 .  He says that he can draw the inference that at some stage the SSC authorised it and then van der Merwe said -  \"I do not agree\".",

I then delegated the order to Major de Kock.  Major de Kock submitted a report in which he explained and motivated his reasons for acting against the targets.  I handed the report to General van der Merwe and on the same day he discussed it at CIC and he got the authority to act\".\n What you see is that Schoon is surmising as to what van der Merwe did.",

            "Yes Mr Chairperson.  In the adjournment the pages have now been cross-referenced and flagged.  If I can go back to where I started because when we started reading it there was the adjournment and in fairness, I'll start from beginning it will be easy to pick up. What I propose to do is just read out what Mr Williamson said before this Committee in its entirety and then come to come back with comments and questions from Dr Barnard where he can shed light on certain aspects.  I'll read passages in their entirety first.\n Chairperson on my page 99 it starts off -\n\"Now by their very nature covert actions were rarely to my knowledge discussed or written about. I append here to document 21 and I quote the report of the National Intelligence symposium held at National Intelligence Head office Pretoria  \"when survival is important it is often necessary for a service to resort to secret actions  which does not comply with the laws, morality, norms or values which controls the public attitudes of the State.  Secrecy both defensive and offensive is important.  Coverage is used to allow the operatives to use secret instructions.\nWhen I was instructed to present the paper to the symposium on the user of cover and secret operations as well as the recruitment of long term deep cover agents or moles I discussed the contents on my paper with my colleagues and found no disagreements with these expressed.  The symposium I was not challenged on my views.  The report was also circulated to the highest level as the discretion list show\". \n Turning to the next page and then the second paragraph Mr Williamson expresses the opinion -\n\"In the light thereof and in the terms of the knowledge which I had of standard secret and/or special force procedures in the then South Africa as well as in many other States I had no doubt that secret, violent and other actions against the revolutionary enemy were an accepted and approved procedure in our overall arsenal of counter-insurgency weapons'.\n Turning over to the next page he deals with fact, and I propose to mearly summarise key features of that page and not read it out,  is that there was a conflict between some  officials from the Police and Justice and Foreign Affairs department who wanted the counter-insurgency programme to be conducted strictly in terms of law and if possible for the law to accord with acceptable western norms. \n\"On the other extreme we had officials especially from the counter insurgency element to the police and the military who felt that a democratic State using democratic methods could never withstand a concerted Soviet-backed revolutionary effort.  Their solution was to spend democratic freedoms and militarise South African society.\nNow the upshot of this debate was a mish-mash of compromise\".  \n Turning to the next page and to then pick up from the third paragraph, \n\"Along all of the above the State and the security forces maintained and expanded their secret ability to attack their enemies without necessarily having to accept responsibility for what was done. The basis of such operations in the grey zone was deniability but it's for this reason that specific so-called chains of responsibility will in many instances be impossible to determine.\nThe operational procedures were designed by people who knew the law in order to circumvent proof of legal responsibility for the deed by the upper echelon.  Such covert action leading to mysterious explosions deaths etc cannot said to be unusual in South African political life\".  \n Turning to the top of next page. \nWith the benefit of hindsight it appears that that upper eschelons, especially the politicians, were so keen to be as what I say legal arms length from covert action that they abdicated their responsibility to exercise close operational supervision of such actions and so lost significant operational control.  Nevertheless. they can never deny responsibility for the budgets used to fund covert actions\".\n Then if we proceed to skip to my page 112 and towards the bottom Mr Williamson is then quoted as saying -\n\"I would imagine so Mr Chairman I now go further so that every serving high level politician, now I'm talking of a politician in an executive position,  a Cabinet minister, most of his Deputy ministers, Chairman of committees have the advantage of receiving on a daily basis Intelligence summaries. Insums, which summarises everything that happened the day before, the week before, projected what would happen tomorrow and the coming week and which reported all incidents\".\n Turning over to the next page at the very top - \n\"Some politician would have asked the Intelligence team to determine who was responsible for these activities and asked why with monotonous regularity the ANC cadres in one or other neighbouring States start their cars, their cars explode, but these questions weren't asked.  There was a tacit acceptance and an understanding that this had something to do with South Africa's counter-insurgency programme that's the only answer I can give\".",

I have already mentioned before that the internal situation was supposed to be stabilised to such an extent that the political negotiations that have already been started there could be guided that we could have a true democracy  in  South Africa.\n I must perhaps place this in the perspective that one of the main negotiating points in the discussions before Mr Mandela's release and also at Groote Schuur and the Pretoria minute was the question surrounding the ending and suspending of violence by the ANC as everybody can well remember.  One of the difficult points was that a prominent member in the search for  peace did not want to end the violence. At the Pretoria minute the word \"suspension\" was mentioned, the \"suspension\" of violence was then accepted.    The violence the question of violence the argument is that at the beginning of the negotiating processors  one of the very prominent main parties to the solution of this conflict was not at that stage willing and prepared  to leave violence.  \n That is then very important and  it must be stress that the South African goverment could not just simply leave its security forces in order to ensure that there is peace in the country when one of the main parties to negotiations did not want to stop violence.

I have the impression that no breakthrough has been made at the Truth Commission or it cannot be made on the basis of various submissions.  I've also tried this morning to do this to tell you about the revolutionary climate which existed in this country.  People were killed not only the questions I have to answer repeatedly about the security forces also by the liberation movement. People went home landmines exploded and the most immoral actions were committed.  How do you know who was the next person travelling on that road?  If you plant a bomb in front of a office building in Pretoria, and I would like to say, those deeds were absolutely immoral.\n The Government of that day through its security structures followed the line of thought where the dangers of communism were underlined.  I'm not always sure whether at certain instances it was exaggerated, you must remember you're referring to 1975.  I'm talking about a world environment in which revolutionary and the so-called what we called in Afrikaans \"terrorism and terror\" and that's also something which you could not beat.  Mao Tsung overtook China, Che Gueverra,  Fidel Castro took over Cuba in that way. Many books were written in this regard.  There was - we had that fear that here was a communist inspired alliance of people who wanted to use the power to usurp the Government of the day.  This was supplemented by all these deeds when all these people were killed.  The SSC's contribution and also the remarks of PW Botha and his colleagues consequently when I was there they felt responsible and they said we would act within the law.  We should act morally and in the execution of these deeds if people act unlawfully it should be understood within this context. I find as if you are hitting your head against a wall to determine how did the people from the old order, how did they experience this?  When people were killed, landmines exploded and I hear that, that various points of view saying that people in this country were necklaced in a most barbaric way.  I think that in the 26 ages this was the most barbaric method ever used.  This led to a psychosis of anciety.  This is what I want to say on the one hand.  \n On the other hand, and that is the second point I want to put, is that certain people who were involved in the middle, who were in the middle of the struggle on grassroots level and as  I said there were no angels involved on both sides, and in this climate sometimes and have already committed atrocities, which are unacceptable and I cannot justify that at all.  It was absolutely unacceptable.  But that was the climate in which the activities or the actions of those times should be understood.  \n A last remark I think it's not just, if the inference is drawn that the leaders of the Government or the Government figures of that day who functioned within the law and who acted morally correct are not accepted.",

If one has to look at it in this way, one looks at how many people there are in a ministerium that determines the strength of your department.  That is why the development of a national independent body was not supposed to be involved in executing certain actions because then one would look for information to justify one's actions.\n For the future of our country in the security and Intelligence community it will have to be investigated very carefully.   I do not want to express an opinion on that.  When I left in January 1992, I refrained from getting involved in Intelligence, but because you have asked me the question, and because I want to say something about Intelligence I do not think it  makes sense to have the division that one has in Europe, like the National Intelligence agency and the South African Intelligence service etc.  There's no model which works for example in England which says it will work here.

We were quite intrigued by the theory that was put forward in the various political parties submissions.  The theory that was put forward by the National Party for example seemed to me to be the so-called \"bad apple\" theory. There seemed to be a group or some people who misinterpreted or did not understand or acted  mala fide in the execution of their duties and so on. That seemed to be the threat that I understood to be running through the submission.  I read in your submission on page 30 paragraph 10.1.25, you will excuse me if I misinterpreted this because my Afrikaans is not very good.  It seems as though you're saying that there were some people who were not behaving professionally and acting very well, in your opinion.

            "Paragraph 10.1.25 means in practice the following.  After the Cabinet in a case which was relevant to the security the State had to execute the relevant order and the normal procedure that would then follow would be that the minister calls the Director General if it's in Cape Town and if there are other senior officials involved, they would not be there, they would tell the AG that the Director General - the director general who would then fax people responsible for that in Pretoria.  He would then say that these people and that the Minister wants this information.   Those people would contact the other under them.  The Commission must understand in the Government of a country's administration there is often a discrepancy between the how an order is given and how it is given through the hierarchy.  It often does not carry the same weight and the same meaning.  That is an international truth regarding bureaucracy.\n I also think that it is in our current South Africa, a critical problem, it's a general problem and that is why it says that orders regarding sensitive safety matters had to be communicated very carefully. If orders aren't given carefully there can be misunderstandings and that can only lead to problems.  \n The second point I want to make is I say in my submission that the most important departments taking part in that time disagreed with each other or there were differences between them.  The police, the Military and the National Intelligence worked closely together.  It was in their line function.  And as a matter of fact and of course officials disagreed.  It is also relevant that there was the granting of a budget.  We have to budget, if you can just grant me a minute, must we leave hospitals or schools or what must we cut out of the budget?  In this people take certain stances on certain matters and people might on purpose often say things wrongly.   An official has an empire and he does not want his turf to be decreased or made smaller.   That is a point that one must remember.  South Africa in those years was not free from differences between departments who disagreed with each other.  I think it was healthy that we disagreed with each other.  \n I must then also formulate something that I mentioned to Mr Lax in a different way especially during the late 80's when the conflict was at its peak, senior officials worked under pressure.  I think if I now think back, it was in a certain sense an undeclared war.  There was great tension and people could have made mistakes under that pressure.  That is the perspective I would like to put it in.",

            "It may be repetitive but I think I do need to say it and in saying it, I just have a feeling and I may be wrong that you have been less than forthcoming and frank with us.  Because you have painted a picture in your description of the State Security Council and the various Government agencies of which you were a Head and the others, Military Intelligence, the security branch etc,  you have painted for us or sketched for us this State Security Council and these various agencies as being primarily and essentially benign in their approach, concerned only preventing the destabilisation of this country, and the identification of people in the broader community with whom in the later 80's with whom you could successfully facilitate and further the negotiation process.  That's the sort of picture that you provided for us.\n There is another view and I'm not saying it's the view that this Commission has accepted, but there is another view and it is the view that is supported by the cumulative effect of the testimony that we have received in this Commission and by the amnesty applications of very senior people, I'm not talking about sergeants, I'm talking about colonels and generals, the cumulative effect of amnesty applications of amnesty applications which suggest contrary to your view that there was a well co-ordinated strategy to target and eliminate people that the Government agencies had in fact identified.  They were assisted in this by well-resourced agencies which produced detailed target dossiers.  There's a fundamental dilemma and I'm repeating what my colleagues have said for this Commission that there are two very different views.  Your view is not supported by the people who've come before us, by some people who've come before us and have said the words uitroei, uitwis, eliminate they meant one thing and one thing only and that is the disingenuous  of people at a high level to suggest that it meant anything else than kill.  We have a very, very fundamental dilemma because at the end of the day we have to make a finding to what, for example bodies like the State Security Council, what their directives meant when they said in the '86,'87 those years when the counter-revolutionary war became more intense, when said use all means possible to fight the enemy.  That they, there is a view that says that they intended the lower orders those charged with carrying out these directives to do exactly that to eliminate them, to wipe them out.  \n As you know there has been this during the Political Party hearings and the Armed Forces hearings people have said well, we may have used word like uitroei, uitwis, maak 'n plan met eliminate but of course we meant that to mean arrest or detain or ban.  Whereas the people who did the uitroeing and the uitwising understood it at all times to mean one thing and one thing only, which was to kill people.  Where I have a problem with the role of NI in that, is that if politicians were using words like eliminate, uitroei, uitwis and they intended them to mean arrest than anything within the scope of the law, but people at the lower level were in fact taking them to mean something else, why didn't the NI the NIS become aware of this?  Why didn't it bring immediately and urgently to the attention of the Government that there was a loose and highly reckless and irresponsible use of language here, which was leading to a situation which strategically that you say that you are against?  \n It seems - I can't understand how these sort of things were happening.  I can't understand how people were being killed, eliminated by for example Head of the security branch for the Eastern Cape, security branch in KwaZulu Natal.  I am talking about Snyman and General Serfontein in Natal who applied for amnesty for the deaths of many people.  Why didn't the NIA know about this?  You described yourself as probably the best agent, well you said amongst the best in the world or very good  I see your counsel shaking their heads, I presume you put yourself above merely a good intelligence agency.  How was it that you didn't know about these things?  \n I've asked a lot of questions but it's a huge dilemma for this Commission.  We have two, as my colleague Ms Wildschut said, we have two fundamentally different realities confronting us and we need your guidance which, where we are to find the truth  somewhere between those two.

If the Truth and Reconciliation Commission listened to evidence which you would like to hear otherwise is that in a country where we need transparency, where we need democracy, where everybody should be able to give their input and now you won't allow me to put my points of view.  I've substantiated my points of view with a full statement.  It does not concur with what other people have said.  I think it's right of the democracy to put your point of view like you see it.  What I have said today is how I saw that state of conflict.  \n I want to refer to a specific document and you refer to certain border activities and you refer to words like neutralise, take out etc.   The document you have sent to me on the 6th October, additional documentation is provided, there's no heading no date but it should, it's the 15th April 1986 and annexure 2 is added.  The plan is called, and it's called a plan to solve problems in the counter-revolutionary warfare.  I want to read paragraph 6 of that document you provided me with.  From the way , this is paragraph 6 -  \n\"From the way in which the revolutionaries and their associates tried to exploit the institutions in South Africa, it becomes clear that the security situation would not be stabilised without the enforcement of the Republic's security legislation\".\nThen it goes on.  \n\"The State cannot afford declaring a State of emergency and legislation providing wider powers to the security situation is necessary to prevent the Republic from  taking more drastic steps.  An element of this legislation, a necessary element is the ability to remove revolutionary elements from the community by detention, undetermined detention where only judges, magistrates, doctors and senior police officials would have access to them\".\nI want to repeat -\n\"a very important element of this legislation is the ability to remove revolutionary elements from the community by detaining them where only lawyers, judges, doctors and senior officials have access to them\".\n By  that  I wish to say,  that the point of view as I understand it and as I have expressed it to the Commission supports this, and I'm not going to expand on this matter any further.

I want to respond to Dr Barnard and say that, yes, we need to discover the truth and I would like to echo the remarks that you need to make about our task also heading towards reconciliation and doing the work that we need to do.  We see that exposure of truth as, however painful it may be, as an essential component of that reconciliation.  We are asking those questions that you are suggesting we need to ask of the liberation movements and asking for their responsibility  for the deeds that were carried out by their members and supporters.  We're asking you of course about the areas that we feel you have first hand knowledge of and we keep coming back to the same things because we are pushing ourselves against that brick wall that prevents us sometimes from finding what the truth is.  I am reminded of the remarks that you made about the psychosis of anxiety which I think we do recognise existed particularly amongst those people who were charged with the task of trying to maintain stability in a situation which was very unstable.  You referred to the task to try and win the hearts and minds of the population, what was generally known as ..(unaudible) in those days.  The \"wam\"(?) strategy I think was familiar to many of us, yes the building of schools, the attempts to improve the lives of people and also one has memories of troopies in the townships playing football or handing out sweets.  Was it not also the task of the State Security Council to be identifying other things which might win hearts and minds, like beginning to change the political rights of the people who were demanding them at that stage, and which was a demand which was gathering, which was informing so much of the instability in the country, would that not also been part of the Intelligence gathering work?",

I think it would be good and I think, won't you ask from information documents from the South African Defence Force, what they did in the late '80's early '90's, what they did to put for example taps in the townships.  What they did to put taps in the townships not the theory, what the Defence Force did in the townships to uplift the social economic lives in those townships for the perspectives, I'm referring to these taps.  I can remember how the Defence Force at that stage in the educational level, how they made teachers available.  Then they had the problem, we're goin to have you would say it's military orientation.  We were well aware that the social economic development of the country formed the basis of our development.  The South African Defence Force had the abilities and resources to do all these things on a wide level.  They were involved and the enforcement of the socio-economic lives of the people and the circumstances of that time.\n Shortly I want to state that I've tried to answer in detail that early in the 1980's it was clear that the problems could not be solved by a continual conflict.  You cannot solve or find a political negotiation in a state of anarchy.

Groups who were perhaps in conflict with other sections of the disadvantaged population and therefore might be used as potential allies for the State.   I think that it is very easy to understand that the State, charged with the need to create stability, would seek such allies as more-or-less classic divide and rule strategy.  I think it is possible, really possible to understand the argument that you are making about stability having to precede the political changes and I can understand that.  But as I understand it the Intelligence gathering structures would also identify the groups or individuals who would be opposing such groups as the Wit Doeke.  And also helping to forment  or suggesting ways in which conflict between such groups could be formented.\n Now if that is so, and there may have been indications that that may have been so and I realise that Intelligence people would not carry out such actions but might be identifying the possibilities, then surely that is contributing to instability rather than to the kind of stability you are talking about.
