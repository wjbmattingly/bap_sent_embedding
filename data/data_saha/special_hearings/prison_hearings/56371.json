In many ways she was the guardian angel for those of us who were in prison and for prisoners. \n Whether they were people that she agreed with politically or not, she was always fiercely there and I would just like us to acknowledge the presence please, of Helen Suzmann, thank you.",

            "My grandfather and I were separated in 1960.  He was a builder in East London and there was a struggle.  He was arrested in East London.\n My grandfather always used to complain that he was treated very badly in East London and when he realised that he couldn't take it any more, he decided to fight against it.  That is fight the policemen or the warders in East London.\n And when he chose to fight, he physically fought them, because he was quite a big man, he was huge.  And they decided to make a plan, they told him that they were going to give him a pick and a shovel so that he could go and dig a hole.\n And he was not aware that he was digging his own grave at that time.  He dug this hole and this policeman was standing there, guarding him.  We were never told as to the identify of that policeman.  He only heard later on when he died, we were called to his funeral and my grandfather started digging this hole, whilst this policeman was keeping guard on him.\n And after having dug the hole, this policeman killed him.  He died in such a gruesome manner because he was not able to take the treatment that was metered out to him at the prison.\n There were certain women with whom he was arrested, who later got out of the prison, but he never came out.  He had so much anger in him, he fought the warders.  This is when they instructed him to dig a hole and that is when the policeman killed him.\n We never saw him, we never even went to the funeral, we were never called.  We never saw him. ...

When we were told by Buyiswa, he was in prison for six months, because he couldn't take the treatment that was metered to him at that prison called Kwanqononqo, that is when he became aggressive and he fought with the warders and he ended up assaulting one of the prison warders.\n He was arrested with a group of women.  I do not know about the rest, but I do know about Buyiswa Nyondo, they were arrested in East London and it was in 1960, I am not mistaken.\n Then after he had been arrested, he was sentenced to hard labour and he just couldn't take that because he regarded himself as a political prisoner, so he did not see any reason why he should be sentenced to hard labour.\n That is when the policeman said he must dig a hole.
