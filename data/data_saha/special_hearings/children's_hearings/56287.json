            "I was 14 years old in 1985.  I am now 25 years old.  In 1985 on the second of September, a Monday.  It was, I think it was the start of a strike where the schools were having boycott actions and I was at Lezuko School in NY4 and I was living in NY21 at number six.  School came out very early on that day.  By 11 o' clock we had all gone home and we went back to the location.  I got home, undressed and went back to the street to my friends.  There was a group of us that liked to get together in NY4.  NY4 is close to Mannenberg.  It is near the railway lines and near the, next to the railway line you have J F Jooste Hospital and you find Mannenberg Road and Mannenberg.\n What was happening there is that the coloureds in that area had been attacking delivery trucks.  We were standing on the other side of the road at NY4.  It was an open field at the time.  There are houses that are built there now facing the old houses in Guguletu.  There was an open field there and we were watching what was happening in Mannenberg.  Police were up and down in caspar's and in police vans and shooting and chasing the people in Mannenberg.  What then happened is that because it was very hot on that day I moved back across the road and sat in front of a yard which had, which was fenced off with vibacrete and there was a tree there so I sat in the shade of that tree between two friends of mine I grew up with and they were seated on either stand of me and I was standing under this tree.  Most of the others were playing on the field, others were watching what was happening on the other side.  \n A caspar then came from Mannenberg Road to the road which was leading into Jooste Hospital and they used the gate at the hospital at the time and that was next to the railway line which is now situated near the road.  When you leave Jooste Hospital and cross the railway line to NY4 you move uphill, because Jooste is at the bottom and the railway line is on a slightly higher level and then the location on the other side.  This caspar came and stopped at the gate.  When it stopped at the gate it went back after hardly five minutes.  I saw it approaching so when I was seated where I was I did not see it and then I saw it coming again down the road.  \n The people were playing on the field across the road and those that were watching saw it stopping.  In fact, they just saw the top and they saw it going back.  While we were sitting there those of us who were on the other side of the road in front of this yard saw those who were on the field playing and watching come running back and some were bleeding, crying, screaming and there were even gunshots that could be heard.  When I got up from there I was getting ready to run away.  The two that were next to me had already run away and everyone was ahead of me already.  Something penetrated my eye and thinking it was probably a leaf from the tree that had fallen into my eye, because things were falling from the tree as well.  It was these pellets that they had been shooting us with.\n Thinking that it was a leaf I did not what, exactly what was happening, I just heard the gunshots and saw these people running away.  Something penetrated my eye and I wiped my eye thinking that it was something that had fallen just, it disturbed my eye and when I moved my hand it was blood and I had actually affected my other eye as well.  When the caspar approached, the people that were in it, its occupants were no longer in the caspar.  I think that some of them must have been crawling on their stomachs so that people could not see them.  When they got to us they did not say a word they just started shooting.  I was the last one to run into NY18, because I could not see that well anymore.\n I ran into another yard there in NY4.  When I got into that yard I had to run away again, because the dogs wanted to bite me and they were, I had to run back in the direction of these policemen.  I then ran around the house of the Ngeto family in this other road and I was in front of them.  I was not running any longer, I was staggering and I got onto the corner of NY18 and another road and I sat there.  I was then taken to hospital where I was admitted for two weeks.  That is all I have to say for now.",

Then fed things appropriate to someone that was going to be operated saying that they were waiting for my parents, because my parents had gone down to the Transkei to visit and my parents came during those few days that they were going to operate on me.  They spoke to them and accepted that they were going to operate on me and when they referred to me I refused to accept it.",

I was asked to be shown what my eye was like, because I had not seen it yet and I saw that it was bad, but rather than having an eye similar to the one that I have got now put in.  There was, both were not going to work, they were going to be dysfunctional so I saw no point in having my own eye removed and having another one put in.  That was why I refused.",

            "Early in 1986, it was quite a while after I had been discharged from hospital and it was quite clear that this, I would never regain sight in this eye.  My parents and I sought out an attorney who could assist us with my problem.  We found one, although I have forgotten the name, but in my statement before Priscilla here at the Truth Commission, I am sure that I have mentioned the name of that attorney and I believe that the attorney has since retired.  After having consulted with this attorney, the attorney kept  advising me to come back on certain days.  So, there was someone that use to assist me at the time by the name of Clive, my cousin's son who lives in Guguletu, Tandakolo.  Tandakolo was present when this incident took place so in thinking that there were, there might be some details relevant to this matter which I would probably not have been able to remember, he was also called in and the attorney attempted to assist us.\n Firstly by trying to establish where these police were from who had shot at us.  I had not considered or I did not realise at the time that there was a difference between railway police and State police who were driving around in the caspars' and the attorney took us one day, took us in his car and we went to these camps around town.  The army camps where he would stop in the road next to these camps and pretend that there was something that he was going to look for inside and while the soldiers or police were in and out there, we had to look at the uniform that they were wearing, because no one could even identify the number of the caspar, because it had stopped on that side and it had gone back in that direction.  So when we got to the second camp Tandakolo said that these people who did this to us had on this uniform.  \n So this gentlemen investigated and in his investigations he came back with a, during the course of his investigations he came back with a report that evidence has been found that this matter took place on the date that we mentioned although I do not know whether he was going to keep calling us since then.  Eventually nothing, we heard nothing about the matter.",

As I said we established a team while I was growing up and at the time we were not familiar with smoking dagga and smoking and so forth, so that place was a rubbish dump where people would cross the road from their homes and just throw their rubbish there and we took the initiative to clean it up ourselves.  We went and we chopped off trees, solid wood to erect the poles for ourselves and on days where we did not go to school, like that day for example, we would go and fetch our ball and go and play.  So anyone who wanted to join us, because we did not always play as a team.\n So then we were playing by ourselves and I think what made people even more furious was what happened in Mannenberg and that is why people came to stand there to watch.  Not that many of them were concentrating on the football, because it was just a friendly street game, it was not really a match.  So people were interested in what was happening in Mannenberg.

I also never ever said to them that I can see, but when they look at me they might see that something is wrong in my eye or they might not pick it up, but I would never say to anyone that there is something wrong with my eye, but I would never hide it from anyone who would ask me whether I could see in this eye and I would tell the person that I am blind in this eye and tell them why.\n My presence here today is, if nothing else, the uselessness for which I lost my eyesight.  I see no reason why, but because of the time and the circumstances which were prevalent at the time things like this happened.  So to me being here and relating my story, it was a source of great pain, endless pain for me, but today it is just one of those things to, the fact that I cannot see, because I live with people.  I do not isolate myself from anyone, I participate in whatever they are doing except those things that I cannot do because of the limitations of one eye.  It is not something that I always think about.

It has touched many of us, but what I find interesting in your story is that you were busy doing the things that young people do.  You were playing, watching soccer when this incident happened.  You were engaged in an activity that is expected of young people to be involved with and doing that you had to experience this incident and loose the sight in your eye, in your one eye, but I also noted in your story telling that you are the kind of person that takes initiative.  You and your friends were busy cleaning up the field, taking away the rubbish and creating a space where you could play.  It was something that is meant to be for young people, that young people should have places to play and that you should not have been removing rubbish, but you and your friends have taken that initiative to do that so that you could have a space to play.  So we really want to thank you for being somebody who has been involved in taking up those kinds of initiatives and involving yourselves in the community in which you live, but also thank you for reminding us that we need to be involved with other people and we need to connect with other people so that we can feel supported by them especially when we are feeling that we have, injustices have been perpetrated against us.
