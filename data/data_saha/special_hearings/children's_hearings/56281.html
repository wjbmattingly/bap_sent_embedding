<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>good bye.  Can you hear me through the headphones.</p>

<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  You are not going to testify, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>MRS BOTHA:  Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Zamikhaya, you have told us in the statement </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>before the Commission about the way in which you were injured.  We, firstly, </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>would like to ask you to tell us when this incident took place. </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>MR BOTHA:  I would also like to greet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Could you please come closer to the microphone </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>so that I can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>MR BOTHA:  I would also like to greet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Thank you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>MR BOTHA:  This incident took place in 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  How old were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>MR BOTHA:  I was 11 years old at the time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  You were 11 years old.  What were you doing at </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>the time, were you at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>MR BOTHA:  I was at school at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  What standard were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>MR BOTHA:  I was in standard two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Do you have any brothers and sisters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>MR BOTHA:  Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Are they older or younger than you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>MR BOTHA:  I am the first born at home.  I was born in 1974.  So, the others are </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>younger than I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Do you remember the day on which this incident </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>took place, the day on which you were injured, what kind of day it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>MR BOTHA:  Yes, I remember it very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Can you just tell us what kind of day it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>MR BOTHA:  This incident took place in 1985, the date was the 17th of June.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>would say that there was conflict there on that day.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Please take your time Zamikhaya, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>sometimes it is very difficult to relate such painful experiences.  You may take your </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>time.  Were you from school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>MR BOTHA:  I would say that I did not go to school on that day, but this incident </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>took place on a Thursday.  The Wednesday I had a headache and I left school.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>think it was approximately two o' clock the Wednesday when I left school.  I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>sitting next to the house, we were living in the KTC area in Nyanga and I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>sitting next to the house and my friends came while I was sitting there.  Because I </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>still had the headache I was sitting there, but at that time the pains were not that </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>bad so I was just sitting there.  My friends came and we all left without me </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>reporting to my mother where I was going.  We went to NY78.  What happened in </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>the vicinity of NY78 is that the police were shooting at the time and someone had </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>been shot near KTC Bazaar.  I would say that we went to go and, out of curiosity, </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>to look at this person that had been shot.  Before we got to the scene, I would say, </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>the last thing I remember is a caspar coming in our direction.  We were walking </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>down NY78 towards KTC.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a> I would say that the last I recall was that caspers' were coming and I came </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>to when the Comrades were taking me into Guguletu Police Station.  I would say </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>that my story goes that far, as far as I can recall, as far as relating what happened </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>before my discharge from hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Were you just walking, going to look at what </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>happened to this person, you were just somebody walking there with your friends?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>MR BOTHA:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  When you were shot you felt the bullet penetrate </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>MR BOTHA:  I never even felt the bullet.  I came to when I was being carried by </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>my Comrades to Guguletu Police Station.  It seems that I lost consciousness when </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>I was shot and I regained consciousness when I got to the Guguletu Police Station </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>and I was put in an ambulance.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Which hospital were you admitted to and how </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>long were you admitted for?  I am quite sure that this is a very painful experience </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>for you to relate where at the tender age of 11, without even being aware of what </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>was happening, you were blinded.  I just want to tell the people that Zamikhaya </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>who is testifying now lost sight of his one eye.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>MR BOTHA:  I will try and tell the people.  I am a youth with no life, I lost my life. </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  The things we are faced with here today are so </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>difficult, because young people like yourself when faced with difficulties like this in </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>life, see their life just disintegrating before their very eyes and what is so painful is </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>that there is not even anything that can be cited as the reason for you having lost </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>your sight.  Could you please tell us, Zamikhaya, what your wish was before this </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>incident?  What were your dreams, your idealogies?  Could you just tell us what </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>your dreams were so that we can try and comprehend the extent of your loss.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>MR BOTHA:  I would start by saying that I am now 23 years old and I am an adult </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>now and I now realise the expenses that I am incurring and I could have been a </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>football player, but because of the loss of sight in the one eye, because there is </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>nothing else I can do, I try and carry on playing football.  Hence, my feelings are </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>that at this age, looking at my peers, I would have liked to have been a professional, </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>but I cannot see myself as being a professional anymore, because I have this </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>permanent damage and this causes extreme loneliness in my life and also makes it </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>very difficult for me to mix with people and so often I just want to go and sit by </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Do you find very often that you are alone as if </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>nobody cares about you, as if there is no one on your side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>MR BOTHA:  Yes, I would say that I often feel very lonely and it feels as if </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>nobody cares.  Even hence the experience, this experience, when we tried to </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>institute steps, for example, my parents trying to establish since they shot at me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>The State at the time told us that we would not be able to lay any charge against </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>the police, because the police could not be prosecuted.  So I would say that that </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>was also one of the causes why at this point I feel such bitterness towards the </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>people that took my life away from me, because I would regard my eyesight as my </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>life.  It could have given me a better life.  I would say that is one of the things that </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>makes it difficult for me to make peace with this incident, because even if the </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>person who did this could compensate me.  I do not see any kind of material </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>compensation, you know, from somebody who is the Station Commander of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>police who was promoted after doing this to me.  I do not see what good his </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>assistance could possibly do.  Any kind of assistance that he could offer me, this </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>person that did this at some stage tried to compensate me by having it, making it </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>possible for me to obtain an artificial eye, but that artificial eye does not help me in </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>any way. </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  So you are saying that nothing could compensate </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>the loss of your sight which is, ultimately, the loss of your life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>MR BOTHA:  I do not see anything that could possibly compensate me for this </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>loss. </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Zamikhaya, I would like to pose a few questions. </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a> As you say you went to try and lay charges or institute a claim.  Did anything </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>become of the matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>MR BOTHA:  I would say that at the time which was 1986, about, there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>people, there was an organisation, something like the Truth Commission who went </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>from door to door and appeared to be interested in assisting people whose rights </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>had been violated and they were working in co-operation with attorneys here in </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>town.  We then instituted a civil claim and we kept going back to them and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>would keep saying to us that we would be unable to charge the police, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>police cannot be prosecuted and there was nothing else that my parents could do.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>They did not know what more they could do.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  I do not know if you can remember, Zamikhaya, </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>that who the attorneys were.  Do you recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>MR BOTHA:  The people who were assisting in this matter, just excuse me for a </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>minute please.  Let me ask my mum. </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Zamikhaya is still asking his mother who the </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>attorneys were trying to assist him in this matter and his mother will try and assist </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>MR BOTHA:  I would say that I know what the address is of the place where we </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>always use to go. My mum says that she knows that there was someone by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>name of David, but someone else who could help clarify this whole thing, who </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>assisted us lives in the, use to live in the same street.  Not exactly in the same street, </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>but not too far from where we stay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Are there any names which were mentioned of </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>people who had anything to do with your injury?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>MR BOTHA:  I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Names of persons who were involved in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>injury.  Do you know of any such name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>MR BOTHA:  Like witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  I am talking about the people who injured you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>Do you have any names or are there, did you recall any names being mentioned at </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>the time when you were trying to institute action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>MR BOTHA:  Their names were unobtainable, because they were in a caspar at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>time, but the Comrades who assisted us at the time by going to report the incident </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>to my parents, took the registration number of the caspar from which we were shot </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>and when we got to Guguletu Police Station the police who had shot me were </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>present at Guguletu Police Station at the time.  So they phoned the ambulance.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Thank you very much Zamikhaya.  I am now </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>going to hand you back to the Chairperson.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Before we proceed can I just sat that </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>the next two witnesses are both going to be speaking in Xhosa so if there are </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>people who have headphones who understand Xhosa, can I please ask you to give </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>your headphones over to people who do not understand so that as many people as </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>possible can participate.  Do any other members of the panel have questions?  Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>Burton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>MS BURTON:  Mr Botha, I would like to ask if you can remember the name of </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>the hospital that you went to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>MR BOTHA:  Conradie Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>MS BURTON:  Thank you.  That will help us to establish the records and get all </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>the details about your case.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:  Thank you Chairperson.  Zamikhaya, thank you </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>for having come here today to come and share your pain with us.  You lost things </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>that are very important in life and it is very painful.  What is even more painful is </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>when you loose things like your sight or any other crucial part of your being, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>loose your life as you have so correctly put it.  The life that lay ahead of you </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>changes in an irreversible way and that is very painful.  It is very difficult to </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>articulate or put into words the extent of damage done as a result of the gross </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>violation of human rights of young people like yourselves.  We do not have the </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>sufficient words, at all, to do that.  In fact I do not believe there is any language that </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>defines appropriately what the damage is to youth.  I would just like to thank you </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>for having come and we would like to ask Xola and Viola to lead you off the stage. </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a> Thank you very much.  </p>
