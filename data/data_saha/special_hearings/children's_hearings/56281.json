Because I \nstill had the headache I was sitting there, but at that time the pains were not that \nbad so I was just sitting there.  My friends came and we all left without me \nreporting to my mother where I was going.  We went to NY78.  What happened in \nthe vicinity of NY78 is that the police were shooting at the time and someone had \nbeen shot near KTC Bazaar.  I would say that we went to go and, out of curiosity, \nto look at this person that had been shot.  Before we got to the scene, I would say, \nthe last thing I remember is a caspar coming in our direction.  We were walking \ndown NY78 towards KTC.  \n I would say that the last I recall was that caspers' were coming and I came \nto when the Comrades were taking me into Guguletu Police Station.

So I would say that that \nwas also one of the causes why at this point I feel such bitterness towards the \npeople that took my life away from me, because I would regard my eyesight as my \nlife.  It could have given me a better life.  I would say that is one of the things that \nmakes it difficult for me to make peace with this incident, because even if the \nperson who did this could compensate me.  I do not see any kind of material \ncompensation, you know, from somebody who is the Station Commander of the \npolice who was promoted after doing this to me.  I do not see what good his \nassistance could possibly do.
