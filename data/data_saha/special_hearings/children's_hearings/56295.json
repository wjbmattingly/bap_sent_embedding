We know that, we knew that we were oppressed, but we continued to attend school until a sign came and we were told to come out of our closets and go and listen to somebody address us at a meeting and I think was the fortnight before we wrote our June exam.  So we went and listened and we realised that there were people that knew what was going on and perhaps they were people involved about, in the ANC.  At the time we just heard about the ANC, we did not know what it was all about.  So what happened is that we became interested and decided that, in any way, these boycotts are going to continue, because in, they started school in 1980 something, after a couple of years, because we could see that parents were taking their children away and sending them off to boarding schools because of the boycotts and so forth.  So we realised that we should rather go into exile instead of sitting at home and doing nothing with all these boycotts and especially at that time at high school they had a student exchange course that they were conducting.  So they would offer students who achieved good results in the exams to participate in this exchange course, but with the boycotts and stuff we realised that we were not going to make it and that we should go and participate in the struggle and then rather carry on thereafter.",

What happened to me the first morning when I got up is that I saw a friend of mine from Langa and he and I had left the country in the same year.\n When I saw him there in the morning I saw him sitting there and I went to him and said, hey, Mac what is happening and I saw that he was not too well.  I knew him as someone that was very fit and healthy and who had been gymming and I wanted to know from him why he was so thin and sickly.

Ever since he arrived and my understanding of it was that we told ourselves we were not going to spend more than a month there.  So spending six months there made us think of a lot of things.  So I went to the Security Department and said, look, there is a certain person that you have got incarcerated here.  I know him and if there is anything, any clarity you want on him, Mac is not involved in politics and he is not involved in these things and they said, no, leave that, because you just got here.  You do not know what is going on here.  So do not come in and involve yourself in what is happening here and I said, no, I know this person.  If there is anyone else that can say anything about him then you bring that person, but we grew up together and I know him best.  They did not want to listen to me and dismissed me saying to me that I should leave and never speak to Mac again.  That was the last time I saw Mac at the Viana Camp.  They would keep taking me from the camp to go and work in Ruanda and come back at night.  So I also eventually left Viana Camp hoping to meet Mac somewhere in the future.\n I think after two or three months people came from the Viana Camp.  It was another group who we were trained with.

I said how is that possible, then they said, no, Mac had been bitten and he fell and when they tried to wake him up he was not waking up and he was foaming at the mouth and his eyes were upturned and I asked them what kind of snake it was.  They said they did not see it and I asked them where did the snake bite him, where was the wound.  They said they did not see any wound and I said how is that possible, there were 30 or more of you.  How can you not know, did the person not scream when he was bitten by the snake and they said no.  Somebody said to me, why do you not just keep quiet and they wanted to know, I said I wanted to know how could somebody just keep quiet when being bitten by a snake and they said to me that I should keep quiet.\n Nobody came to confront me about Mac's story and when I went elsewhere I had to write a report and I wrote a report saying that I knew Mac.  If you want to know anything about Mac, come and ask me, because we grew up together in the township.  No one was interested enough to call me and ask how I had met Mac and the same thing at the camp, still Mac's name was mentioned and nobody came to ask how I had met him or how I know him.  What annoyed me even worse about Mac's story is that I was hoping that at least at his funeral they will say why he was being held at Viana Camp.  They said, at his funeral they said that he was a hero and he wanted to be a communist and there was nothing to say why he was held in Viana.

So I was very confused as to how I was going to carry on, because the one person that I knew that led a good life, an exemplary life, was Mac and if they could do this to him they could do this to me any time.\n As soon as I went to confront them lots of other things started happening such as them taking me while we would be sitting there, they would call me and into the administration and there was someone, there was, known as, who was working at Armscor, was Dasaai and he was informed that because he was working it was seen that since he was working at Armscor he was a sort of spy and they would give us firearms to take to the other section.  So I do not know what it was all about, but I was never directly accused of being an informant, but they did things like that.

Whatever was wrong I would be accused of, until what eventually happened and what led to my arrest and incarceration is while training there, we had started our training, part of our training was overcoming obstacles.  I was still very young and very fit so I had no problem with obstacle courses and I did my training and showed the others and then I stood watching the others and while standing there I would wonder a bit and I found a firearm, an AK47 which was lying there.  I, we were not allowed to carry firearms, we were carrying batons at the time.  So I saw a firearm lying in the grass and I realised that it might have been left mistakenly by an instructor and I picked it up out of curiosity and looked at it.  I remember the last having this gun in my hand looking at it and turning it round and then all the officers were around me, assaulting me and they grabbed this firearm and then I was taken to a medical point and I was injected and I was dumped at a guardhouse which was near the gate so that all vehicles that came into, this is the little hut which is at the entrance and while lying there, every time I tried to speak it felt like my tongue was swollen and I could not speak.  I could not even move my fingers, they were stiff and it was, I slept there from the morning until shortly after lunch without being able to move.\n Late at night about sunset a chief Afrika arrived at the security camp and spoke to these people and they put me behind in a landrover and I was taken to another place where food stocks were kept approximately seven kilometres from the camp.  I stayed there.  I must have been there for approximately a month, but I cannot tell you exactly how long it was, because most of the time I was assaulted, but I really cannot say how long I stayed there, because sometimes Afrika would come there and assault me at times as well and I would never know why I was being assaulted.  I was not thinking anything, all that was in my mind was these people, I do not know what these people are doing.  All I want to do is train and all I want to do is leave here and go back and train.  \n The person that kept bringing me my food would tell me, do not worry, you are going to go back to the camp and train and he would be friendly and we would do exercises, but when exercising he would go behind me and assault me and when I lost consciousness he would leave me alone.  What I do remember very well is Afrika took out a firearm which was his pistol which was at his waist and asked me, do you know this?  I said, no, but I know that it is a gun.  He took it and said to me, shoot.  I said to him, no, this place is enclosed, how can I shoot and I followed his instruction and then he took his firearm back and assaulted me and asked me whether I knew about any rapes and I said, who did I rape at the camps.  He made me sit down and he kicked my feet with boots until my skin came off.  When they came in there they would assault me so badly.  I remember the times when they would be there and every time I would come, I would lose consciousness and I would regain consciousness and find myself alone.  \n Then I was shifted to this house which was seven kilometres from the camp.

I do not know the date or the time or anything.  All I can remember now is between May and the time I recovered, because I did recover fully, on the first of January 1983, this was seven months during which I do not know what happened, but it, by the time I recovered after seven months my left arm was non-functional and I could not speak and I had scars all over, I could not stand and I could not walk and I remember that.  I remember sitting in a corner not knowing where I was, not knowing who the people around me were and they would call me on an unfamiliar name.  They would call me Mad Joe.  So I would be worried, because I wanted to know who was Mad Joe and I remember picking up a firearm and looking at it, but I was now worried whether I had shot at anyone and wondering if I was in jail and so forth.\n As time went by I got better and better and I could walk as well.  One day I was called to the administration block and I was asked do you know Afrika Nkwe and I said, yes, I know him and I was told to go back to my cell.  I went and I sat in the cell and all this time I could not speak to anyone.  I could not know where I was coming from, why I was there.  I was just staying there not knowing anything.  My name was Mad Joe at that time.  Everybody had their own names there.  They would take us from one cell to another cell.  We were then separated from the people who were in that first cell.  We met new people, the others would go out to work in the garden and I would stay inside.  They would suffocate me sometimes, my face was swollen up.  I could not go out and work with others.  \n All the time I was wondering what was happening outside, because I did not know how the people I was with were.  Some had blisters in their hands.  I recovered from that life.  There would be always somebody who would be beaten up who would be screaming at night.  I was sick at the time thinking that when I recover they would beat me again.  The ANC cadres outside said that this boy has got to be released.  They tried to convince the people that I have to be released.  There was a library there, we would be taken on Wednesdays to take books so that we can read, but I was staying in a corner, I did not want to talk to anyone.  They were then made to make me talk even though I did not want to talk.  They would give me a book to read.  I would then do those exercises, because they wanted me to talk to somebody.\n I then regained confidence until I would be released in the mornings to go and work outside and come back late in the afternoons.  I was then called and asked and they told me to write a statement.  I said that, how can I write a statement, because I do not know anything.  They told me to write a statement to tell them what I was doing there.  I told them that I know this is a prison, but I do not know why I am here.  They said that I must not waste their time, because I know what I have done.  I told them that what I remember is that I had a gun in my hand and I was beaten up.  After that I could not remember anything.  They said that I was wasting their time, I must answer their questions.  If I do not want to talk they would take me to a dark cell and lock me inside alone.  \n We would rotate from one cell to another, but there were people who were locked in dark cells.  They wanted me to put, they wanted to put me there in that cell.  People in that dark cell would not be allowed to go outside as we were allowed.  What I did is because amongst the security guards there were people I knew from 1982, they were in the camps, they were training at that time.  While they were guarding me they would tell others what was happening in the camp.  They said that I took a gun and pointed a person, I wanted to shoot the person, but they overpowered me. I just took their story.  I, they asked me this person that I wanted to shoot, I said it was Manenberg.  I agreed to what they were saying.  \n Manenberg use to come and tell me different stories.  I was always in conflict with him.  I then signed a statement.  They took me back to the cell.",

If there could just be some kind of assurance that you were at the camps even though those people were not going to come forward and testify to what you are saying, our investigators will pursue the matter.\n The testimony which you gave us here today shows the way in which children sometimes saw, situations in which children sometimes found themselves which they did not, which they never anticipated because of the way things were.  As you say, there were so many boycotts at the time and it brought about a lot of meaninglessness in your life and made it plain that the only meaningful thing which you could do was to go and join the ranks of the ANC in Umkhonto we Sizwe, but now the sad part that you are relating is that it even that you went to join the organisation which you perceived as holding up some kind of hope for you, you did not go and sacrifice, you saw this as your hope and it seems as though you were terribly disappointed and even back here at home you were disappointed by an organisation which you saw as the one which could provide answers to you for the predicament which you were in and we feel very bad about it and we would like to promise you that, from, on our part, we will pursue this matter and it does not matter if nobody is going to come and testify to corroborate what you are saying, but what is good is that the ANC has come to us and told us about the way people were treated in their camps.  If your name or the name which you say you were given then, called Mad Joe, and also your commander, if you could give us the name of your commander at your camp we would follow up on that.  You have related a very sad story and what I have noted in your testimony is that you say what you found most difficult was that you were given another identity that you could not relate to and that is something that disturbed you very much, it is getting another name.  It just shows that the way in which you ended up there led to a lot of heartache in so many dimensions and we would just like to assure you that we are going to follow up on this thing, on this matter.
