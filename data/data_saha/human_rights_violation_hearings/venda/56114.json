            "The Chairperson and the Commissioners and everybody who is here, the audience, I am thankful.  What led me into being deposed and getting this banishment and some of the consequences that was on the 9th of September 1965.\n Personally my father died in July 1963, then I was made the Chief in 1963, December on the 15th.  Then I was working in Pretoria, staying in Soswell Hostel.  Before I became a king or a Chief, I asked other people as to why Mr Tsowasa was deposed and he was in Natal, why Mr Tsikonelha went to Zeerust.\n Those people replied as follows:  they said there are \nVENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n3 R TSHIKALANGE\nsome people who have authority and power who can put people in power and sometimes remove them and I asked them who are these people and they said this one White man who is using a car, who does it.\n I wanted to know, I enquired, I wanted to investigate as to where do they get such rights, how does one get power.  That is not the way it should be.  As I was still finding out, I realised that there was something written down, they had the powers because it was according to the rules, it was legal, you can put somebody in power and sometimes, as long as he complies with what they wanted.\n Then I realised that it was an act which was enacted in 1927, and I realised that the very same act, it was during the time when the Whites arrived here.  They went back to London and came back with this Act in 1927 and gave it to the Governor General so that they shall put the Chiefs in rural areas, that led into the situation that I am.\n Then I realised that there was no other way other than getting committed that I shall be (indistinct).  Fortunately on the 17th of July 1965, when we were at Mbele, there came some letters, some letters arrived, which were written by Mr (indistinct).  These letters explained that somebody could just be deposed and they know how they could do that.\n The letter that challenged me together with other people was, I am going to read it as follows.  The letter reads as follows, it was addressed to the Chief (indistinct).\n Firstly I'd like to create, the people who are in Pretoria, they wanted me to address the law which was enacted in Parliament, last session, which gave us the power so that there shouldn't any appeal made when we are going to VENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n4 R TSHIKALANGE\ndeal with this.  If somebody is going to be very opposed to what we are doing, we are going to send him to prison, where the other people are.  Since I am given this power to put anybody in power the people who are in authority have some, are in unity.\n This letter is the letter that I received on Friday which was responding to the report that I had given to the people of Ramwoda.  They told me that it is the only letter is like for the Minister.\n That is what happened, it was so difficult.  I'd like you to help me in the secret which is not being given to somebody so that we shall get the laws and rules.  We want to contact people like Tshikalange and Maqowe and other people who I've already done a recommendation.\n Now I feel that, I hear that some people who are in power in (indistinct) what worries me is that Ngadeni is the son of Maqwesa, now are you not giving a platform for conflict?\n According to my views, we wanted Maqwesa to be in power, then he took Ngadeni and took him somewhere where there will be a space.   The people who will be creating some conflicts, we are going to give them court order, deposition order.\n I'd like to arrive there now, let them write if there is any possibility of us seeing each other and other people who are going to arrive this week.  We are going to tell the Chief Commissioner that we are electing this person, we don't want to go for Christmas before we know who is going to have the Chiefship.\n This is the whole thing.  If you read this, just burn it because this is witchcraft, thank you.\nVENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n5 R TSHIKALANGE\n These letters are six, I am only going to read two.  This letter is going to make you feel that if at all you are a leader, you should know how Chiefship is so that one should not just simply be deposed as we are called Chief's orders.  I am just going to read two letters now.",

            "Okay, fine, I am not going to read them, I am just going to read one.  I am just going to read one.  Mr Chairman, forgive me because I just said that the case took about thirty years, I think thirty minutes is going to be very limited, so I think we are still going to go further, but it means that, you are well aware that in South Africa people depose you, you are only given 300 years to return, that means there is conflict.\n The first letter, listen to this, the letter is dated the 12th March 1965.  I am writing this letter to you to notify you that where it has worsen.\n Since I read that letter it had increased, it is my view to announce that into the point that I am, we have heard about I wipe tears from your eyes.  Now that I realised that you gained opulence, you have turned against me, I am on my way to go to the people in authority, who are going to look into this.\n If you knew that the stool that is on top of the mountain, is of less importance than the one on the platform, I made you sit where you are.  Now when you have a family, you know how much you have at the bank, one of the people, or young brothers or, who could not know how much it hurt.\n If you know opulence can just disappear any minute, \nVENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n6 R TSHIKALANGE\nthank you.\n After that, the Commission, now that I come before the Commission, I knew that I would get some help.  I said it is 30 years without saying this.  Now what really worried me was after I had travelled a great deal, there was a time, one day on the 9th of August of 1965, when the Commission of Enquiry who was led by a Chief Commissioner, VNP Leibrandt together with Mr JJSP Stassen and Oliver, Chief of Conventional, that day it was propelled that I was going to be killed.\n And I got people who alerted me on that aspect, I didn't go home to sleep, I went to Sebasa.  This is confirmed by the letter that was written by the (indistinct) that I was going to be killed.  It is right here in the letter, I got this from Pretoria.\n It was on the 9th of August 1965 when they wanted to kill me, but then they could not succeed.  I ran away from where I was, I went to Dopede, because I kept on moving from one place to another.\n When I was at Dopede, I had to go into Pietersburg because the (indistinct) wife had been arrested.  When I arrived at Mogewa's place, while I was on the (indistinct), two traffic officers came with Mr Ravela.  They had gone through the bus, they asked me as to where I was going.\n I told them I was going to Pietersburg, and they asked me to leave so that they shall give me a lift and then I got out of the bus, I alighted and then they gave me a lift.\n When I reached Louis Trichardt, I was so surprised it was something to six.  This police was driving on the way, said are you (indistinct) Tshikalange, I said yes.\n Are you not the one who is being looked for, and then\nA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n7 R TSHIKALANGE\nI kept quiet and I realised that he had some news.  Then he went to the police station, he then opened the door, the back door, then got hold of me, then he grabbed me, so I was made to sleep in a cell before I could consult my lawyer.\n The lawyer, whose name was Ritswalda, I told him that I was getting to the cell.  Then I slept there.  They came early in the morning, something to six, they took me back to Sebasa, that was when I had already been arrested and I was being returned to the cell.\n When they told me that, they made me to write down a statement and there was some other people who had been bribed by somebody who knew that the people had taken my file.\n Those people said we were asked to kill you, they gave me the names of those people.  They said we were told that we should kill you, but we are not going to kill you.\n As I was seated there in the cell, somebody arrived.  A policeman who is now in the security services (indistinct).  He opened the door and said to the people, listen you people, this is Mr Tshikalange, he is the Chief.\n And those people said to me look Mr Tshikalange, that person is saying you don't have to make a noise, he is saying we don't know you.  Can you now realise that we were told to kill you?\n Those people were M.C. Botha, Mabasa, Josef Machari, William Tsesikure, Thomas Raninal.  Those are the people who really saved me that day.\n Now, when I had been taken from Louis Trichardt by this, the ones I mentioned earlier, I was just been taken back again to the police station.  I resisted to be locked into the cell, I wanted du Preez.  I told Mr du Preez that VENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n8 R TSHIKALANGE\nI wanted to tell him something, because we want him, I want to see him, because I hear of him.\n When I approached, he told me, oh, you are so young and I said, yes, I was very young then.  I said, it was me.  They said okay take him to the Station Commander.  When I went to Visah, Visah said we've got something for you.  We understand they want to kill you.\n Then he said okay take him and lock him in the cell.  If he dies, then we will accountable for his corpse.  Then I realised that it was in line with what was said and those people was from the Station Commander.\n That is what I want from the Commission to investigate.  In saying that about the Act which says the Governor General has power to put somebody in power and remove and I did say I wrote to the (indistinct) in 1964.  In so saying that only led me to jail, that is what I want the Commission to investigate, because I was innocent.\n As I am saying in accordance to the Act which says we want people to sit down and talk, we want them to sit down and talk and discuss.  There are a lot of things that one could say.\n The Black Administration Act in 1947 says if we look at the way how homelands were created, there are certain areas especially when they are creating towns, where Black people who are six in one area, when six people can stay very normal.  If you look at how we're living around, we are so crowded, three this side, three the other side.\n The living itself is not so big.  It is equal to what the White man has.  We want to talk before the (indistinct) were removed from here, we want equality in land.\n That is one big issue that I was facing with the \nVENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n9 R TSHIKALANGE\nGovernment at that time, besides the (indistinct).

If you have any more files, we'd really appreciate you giving it to us and I want to thank you for confining yourself to 30 minute.  I know you had a lot to speak about.\n And certainly the issues that you speak about, concerning yourself and your family and what you suffered, that is very important for us to hear and you also make recommendations in your statement about the village in particular, that there is a need for compensation and you know that there is a Committee that is looking at those issues, the Reparations and Rehabilitations Committee on which Mr Manthata serves, and they have to make \nVENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n16 R TSHIKALANGE\nrecommendations to the President.\n I am sure Mr Manthata as well as other members of the Commission listening to what you were saying and that the consequences of the apartheid system, the policies, the harm it did, I am sure that the new Government must realise that there is a moral responsibility to look at those issues and to try and redress all those ills, all the harm, but thank you very much for being so considerate, because you know that we have got other witnesses and I know that we cannot cover 300 years in 30 minutes, but thank you for confining yourself to 30 minutes.  Thank you very much sir.",
