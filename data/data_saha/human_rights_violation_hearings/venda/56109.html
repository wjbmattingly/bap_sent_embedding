<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>3 MA NDWHUDZANIA</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> No, I have got my father-in-law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> He sits with you on the podium, but I didn't know how you would see it to come alone to sit there, we normally.  Please be at home, be comfortable and relax.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a> Can you please tell us who you are, that is how many children have you got Masia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> I am Masia Ndwhudzania, I've got five children.  No, they are not going to school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What are they doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> I'm doing nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I mean the children.  If they are not at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> Children are going to school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> To school, the seven of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> They are five, all of them are going to school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And are you working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> No, I am not working.  Yes, he is working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You have come to tell us about your child who was found shot dead.  Could you please tell us what you know about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> What I know is this, on the 2nd of February 1990, it happened on that night.  I was asleep when it happened and I was told early in the morning.  The witnesses who were present are even present here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> They saw it better than you did or that they were there when the whole thing happened together with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> Those are the people who have got the right evidence because it happened while I was asleep and I was told that the next morning by those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>VENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>4 MA NDWHUDZANIA</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> No one in the family saw it except those others that you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> Yes, it is my father's younger brother and he is present here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> So if he hasn't made a statement, it will be very difficult for us to question him or her.  We need to question people on the basis of a statement that they have written and taken oath to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a> But otherwise okay, can you tell us what you did with the child after you were told where the child was and the state in which you found the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> In hearing that it happened, a person was sent to my father's younger brother and my father's younger brother went in and witnessed what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a> When I went there, the corpse was covered.  My husband's younger brother was responsible for everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Do everything, he handled the whole matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> Yes, I mean that and I was sick, suffering from falling one day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Okay.  I will leave you over to Russel Ally, who has had contact with our investigative team on this matter.  Perhaps he can lead you on the basis of what he might be having in the office.  Over to you Russel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALLY:</span> Go through your statement slowly so that we can recreate the events that you are describing.  In your statement that this incident took place in 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a> It was during a period you say, of public violence around Venda when the youth were busy making the then Government of Apartheid ungovernable.  And that the youth were being arrested all over Venda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a> Now your daughter Joyce, was she part of this youth who VENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>5 MA NDWHUDZANIA</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>were involved in these events which were taking place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> She then followed later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALLY:</span> The day of this incident, it was in the evening and she went to a meeting and it was at those meetings were these discussions were taking place.  Where the youth were protesting against the Venda Government and against independence, yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> She was not part of that meeting, it was just a pandemonium that she later learnt of as people were passing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALLY:</span> And in your statement you speak about the Venda Defence Force firing on these youth and your daughter was one of those who were fired upon.  Now, this statement that you make about the Venda Defence Force, this was something that was - was this told to you by people - that is was the Venda Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> She says she is not clear about the question, will you please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALLY:</span> In your statement you say that it was the Venda Defence Force who fired on the youth and your daughter was amongst this youth.  Now how did you get to hear that it was the Venda Defence Force, who told you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> The local people told me about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALLY:</span> And you also say that you tried to have an investigation into this.   Can you tell us a little bit about that investigation, about what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWHUDZANIA:</span> Well my husband's younger brother knows a lot about it.  He can account on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALLY:</span> We are going to ask to get a statement from your husband's younger brother.  But just to say that what we have learnt was that during this period we know that this</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>VENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>6 MA NDWHUDZANIA</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>was before the take over by Ramashana and that there was a lot of tension in the area and that the youth were very active in protesting and demonstrating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a> And we still trying to get from former people involved in the Defence Force their account of these events because often the explanation that they were giving was that they were acting in self-defence, that the youth were going on a rampage, that they were attacking people, that they were attacking businesses, property and that the Defence Force and the police were acting in self-defence.  We are not convinced and satisfied with that explanation, we believe that there is a lot more that needs to be discovered and learnt about that period and a lot more investigation that needs to be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a> But that is one of the areas where we are busy trying to find out as much information as possible.  So we, at this stage, all that I can really say to you is that our investigators are looking into this period and we are trying to get statements from some of the people who were involved as to why they were doing what they did and to question this position that they're putting forward that they were acting in self-defence, because in most of these cases, often warning shots were not fired, live ammunition was used, excessive force was used and we think that an explanation needs to be given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a> We'll ask our statement taker to get a statement from your husband's younger brother and as soon as we have a clearer picture and more evidence and more statements, then we will try to give you an idea of what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a> But thank you very much for coming and I am sorry that at this stage there is not more than that that we can </p>

<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>7 MA NDWHUDZANIA</p>
