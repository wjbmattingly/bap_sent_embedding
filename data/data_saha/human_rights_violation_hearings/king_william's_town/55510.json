When we woke up in the morning, the house was full of bullet holes, even the furniture was full of bullet holes.\n The police then came, they looked at the damage at my home, others were taking photographs.  They  found 22 bullet holes.  The windows were all broken.  We went to the ANC offices and told them what happened.\n They helped us in repairing the windows.  After two months we had a knock on the door, I did not open the door.  They went in the back door, they kicked the kitchen door and then they went in.  We were in the room, in the bedroom.  My children were in another bedroom, in the dining room.\n We heard a noise in the kitchen.",

The second time we heard a car stopping near my home, at the back of my home.\n While we were still listening to that, we heard a door, a back door being kicked.  There was a noise, after that a window was broken.  The house was shaking at the time.  We kept quiet.   We heard that there was a certain sound, we covered ourselves with blankets at that time.\n I took off a blanket over my face, I heard that there was a certain smell in the house.  I woke my husband up.  While I was still trying to look at what was happening, I saw that there was a car parked outside.  It was facing towards my home.\n We again covered ourselves with blankets.  We then heard another noise.  The dining room door, we heard three gunshots, we did not open the door because it was locked.\n This person went in the back, in the kitchen door.  We heard a knock.  They kicked the door and it opened.  We found out that in the morning.  We heard that there was someone in the kitchen because it was dark, this person did not see clearly.  We just heard the footsteps.\n We could hear that he was placing something on the floor.  This person then left the kitchen.  We were so scared, we did not even want to go and look at what was happening.  After a while we went through the windows.  The children were in the dining room.  We told them to open the window, we took three children together with a girl who was sleeping there.\n We took them to one of our family members' house.  We were so scared, we did not know what to do.  While we were still trying to sleep, we couldn't sleep.  We went back to our home.  We found out that everything had been burnt down.\n The curtain had been burnt down, everything in the house - it was dark in the house, everything was burnt to ashes.  While I was still looking at that my husband said that someone placed something on the floor, I have forgotten about that at that time.\n He went to the telephone in the clinic, reporting that he heard something being placed on the floor in the kitchen.  The police told us not to go into the house.  We stayed outside.  The people who were going to work, saw us sitting outside in the morning.\n The windows were all broken - the kitchen windows and there were holes in the kitchen and in the dining room.  The house was shaking, there were cracks all over in the second incident.\n I have a girl staying in Zwelitsha, she bought a house.  The other girl of mine is also staying in Zwelitsha in a flat.",
