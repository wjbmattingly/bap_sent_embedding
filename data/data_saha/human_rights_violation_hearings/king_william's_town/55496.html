<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>

<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In 1963, it started fighting against the Government ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the 8th of April 1963, something happened, which led to your presence here to-day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please tell us what happened Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> We were 17 people here in town who got arrested.  We were going to attack boers in the charge office.  I was one of the leaders of that group.  The boers were treating us badly at the time.  When we arrived in the charge office, the gate was too small.  I was one of the people who entered first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you armed ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> Yes, with axes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you have any petrol bombs ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> No, we did not have any petrol bombs.  When we entered the charge office, there was one young man Njopo.  There were other leaders who were arrested before.  They were in that charge office.  I went straight to the charge office.  We were to attack the charge office.  The boers ran away when they saw us because we were armed.  I recognized one of them.  He had a gun in his hand.  I had a petrol bomb and an assegai.  I threw that assegai. He was, he was standing 15 metres away from me.  The other men had ran away.  Njopo was the only one, who was there with me.  When I was about to leave, I got shot and I was struck in my leg.  I then tried to run away.  When we were about to reach a corner, I could not run any longer.  There was blood, I tried to hide, in a rubbish bin.  After a while I saw them with a torch,  I hought it was in the morning.  It was at about 1 in the morning.  I thought that he did not see me.  He passed me, he then came back.  He said, come out Poqo.  We were known as Poqo at the time.  He talked Afrikaans, saying that, come out Poqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a> There were three men, black men, Coetzee and another police.  I don't know his name.  They asked for weapons.  I told them that I did not have any weapons with me.  I could not walk.  This black man helped me.   Coetzee said that he must not help me, he must leave me.  This man said that I cannot leave him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were then arrested ?  You were handcuffed and you were taken to prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> They handcuffed me at that time.  I then sat down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And  Joubert(?)  was also assaulted.  When you sent to Queenstown ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> We were arrested in King William's Town.  There was a lot of us and we were divided.  One group went to King William's Town.  We'd go up here at the Judge, now and again but even there it was postponed,  transferred to Grahamstown until we were sentenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Twelve years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> 12 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Judge Cloetze sentenced you.?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">J NONGENA:</span> Yes, Judge Cloetze.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Therefore, you went to Robben Island ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> Yes, but we went via Port Elizabeth.  We stayed there for about two, three weeks and then to Robben Island.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your health deteriorated at the island ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> I was, I would go to Cape Town.  They wanted me to work at the prison, but I couldn't because my joints were affected.  I could not even walk properly.  Fago, who passed on would help me walk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see a doctor in prison ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> There was a doctor in the prison that would examine me.  It was difficult even to sleep.  I was bent.  I told this man that if I go to work, I won't come back.  If they forced me what I'd do is, I would send someone to tell the boers that it was too difficult for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what eventually happened ?  How were your released ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> These men, I was then told to go to ....(indistinct)... for the sick.  It is on this day that I was sent through to Cape Town when a plaster of paris was put around me.  After a month, it was removed.  It was from my upper chest to my waist.  They removed it because it was too painful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps you can show us later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> I went here to other doctors who examined me.  I wore another plaster of paris.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were released in 1975  ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> Yes, I was released in 1975.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your request to the Commission is that you'd like the Commission to tell the President that you got injured while you were in the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You also would like a project to be started in your area, in order to encourage people ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did I leave out something ?</p>

<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONGENA:</span> Yes, because Charles came to me and he came to apologize and I forgave him.  I would like Coetzee to come forward, if he's still alive and apologize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If he is still alive, we are going to tell him to come forward because there won't be peace between yourself and him.  Thank you, Mr Nongena.</p>

We had to leave Potsdam as a result.  When we left, we had a meeting.  I then had to leave and stand outside because we thought they were going to destroy the venue.  As I was outside, there were people who ran away and went to the travel police station.  They had weapons.  They said we must raise our hands.</p>
