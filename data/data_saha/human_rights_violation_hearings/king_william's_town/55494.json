I\ncame back after 2 years.  In 1966, I stayed  in Hanga.  The one day 3 policemen came and my boss said I'm being called by these policemen.  Mr Card introduced himself to me, e.  They requested that I get into the car with them.  I left.  We got to King William's Town at the office.  They closed me into the car, locked me into the car.  They came back after a few minutes, got into the car.  They did not tell me where they were taking me.  This car was driven toward Nchoga.  It was in the morning.  When we came close to the river next to Nchoga, they stopped the car.  They got off the car.  They asked me if I know Umgazi.  I said that I do not know him.  The policeman that was standing next to me took me out of the car.  He said that we are not playing games here.  \n They handcuffed me onto a pole.  They said that I must tell the truth,  I know Umgazi who's got a garage in East London, a petrol station.  I did not know this Mr Umgazi.  They said that he had a petrol station with Pan African motives as its name.  Mr Card then shot into the air and said that if I do not tell the truth, I was going to die there.  They did not beat me up.  They, they unchained me, put me into the car.  This car was driven to the Supreme Court in Grahamstown.  They locked me into the car yet again.  They asked if I would recognize Mr Umgazi if I saw him then.  I re-iterated that I did not know him.. They went inside.  It was the first time I saw Mr Umgazi in Grahamstown.  Late in the afternoon they took me home.  They left, they actually left in the evening on the way home.  They did not take me home.  That is my complaint here to-day.  It is Mr Card who threatened me.",

As we are learning and growing within the Commission, especially in Pondoland, we heard elderly, elderly men who were fighting in the early 60's on the mountains in Pondoland for liberation.  That makes us realize that we are a people who sacrificed themselves from of old for the liberation that we have to-day.  Thank you,  Mr Nongena.\nEven though you were touched deeply and you cried.

We have listened this morning to their evidence.  On the strength of the summary which was furnished to us, an affidavit was prepared by Mr Card?, by us, on behalf of Mr Card? and has been handed to the Commission and which I understand is in your possession.  It dealt with the allegations as set out in the summary, although as it indicated, was a very brief summary,  Mr Card?  did  the  best he  could to  deal  with  the  allegations.  It  seems\nhowever, from  listening to the evidence this morning from Mr Boyi particularly, that there seems to be a  measure of deviation from the summary that was handed to us, in that the summary alleges that the incidents took place as is listed in or set out in Paragraph 1 of the summary, during or around 1963.  As I understood Mr Boyi's evidence this morning, nothing transpired , as far as Mr Card? is concerned, in 1963 but that the incident took place in 1966 and as such there were further allegations set out in the summary which obviously do not pertain any longer to Mr Card?.  For example, if I may read the allegations contained therein that he was in 1963 severely assaulted and tortured.  Certainly from his evidence to-day, certainly it does not relate to Mr Card? in any way and he says he was shot while being interrogated.  He didn't actually mention that to-day as far as I could hear and that was also alled he was shot in 1963.  I'm not sure who to-day he alleges shot him or whether is still alleges that he was shot.  He does mention that he was continuously harassed by, allegedly by Mr Card? and Mr Xanti Sebe.  At times he visited in work but only, but he doesn't allege that to-day as far I can see either.  If  I may lead Mr Card? to deal with the allegations as they have been put to-day.\n      Mr Card?, you've heard the allegations to-day.  I think that it is common cause there was no allegation against you in respect of any incident in 1963 as the evidence was led to-day, and as I put to the Commissioner it was contrary to the, to the summary that was given to us, as to the allegations that were made.  In any event, if we deal with the allegations, do you know Mr Makhi Boyi ?  Have you met him before.\nMR CARD?: I've never seen him in my life, Mr Chairman, members of the Committee.  I saw him here for the first time, in fact I was looking around to see who were the, who would be looking at me to see who I was to-day to see whether I could identify and only\n when they came up here, did I realize for the first time that those were obviously the people.

            "Mr Chairperson, I'd like just to continue to deal with the allegations as they were presented this morning.\nMR CARD?: Mr Chairman, I think what I should do, is deal with some of the issues that I had in my original statement and then I'll, I can deal with what is being said here.  I repeat that I do not know these two gentlemen, nor did I know the gentleman from, who made the allegation in Queenstown, Mr Yoyo.  I've never, I've never seen them in my life before.  Mr Chairman, I joined the Police Force in 1947.  1949, I became a detective and my duties as a policeman was to keep law and order in this country, in accordance  with the existing laws.  At no time did I consider that I should not take steps against those who broke the law, merely because they were fighting against the injustices of the apartheid laws.  I want that clear.  That was my duties at the time and when that did become an issue, I resigned from the Police Force. In other words, at a later stage in my life, I realized that in fact it was affecting me  and I resigned.  With regard to where I was and now at 66.  I think, let me start off  by saying that I, because I was, I was, I'm  a  Xhosa linguist, I  was sent  by the  Commissioner of Police  to  various\nplaces, throughout the country, and I must say, I think I was successful  with regard to the cases I handled.  I handles cases in Port Elizabeth, I handled cases in Cape Town, in Durban, Pretoria and Johannesburg.  I was very well known amongst all the political people in this country.  In fact I also gave evidence in the Rivonia trial, so I know my name was bandied about quite a lot and I can also say that there were times when I was in other parts of the country, that allegations were made against me and it was obviously a mistaken identity.  I want to say right now, Mr Chairman, that I don't deny what these gentlemen are saying, maybe they were assaulted, but whatever the case is, it's mistaken identity.  I was definitely not here.   I have never worked in King William's Town.  There's a possibility and the odd time that I passed through here.  I want to say that I didn't work with Charles Sebe.  I went with him on one occasion, I was involved with him.  We went to Robben Island in connection with ANC matters and not PAC matters.  I went with him to Robben Island and we came back together, but I never worked with Charles Sebe here in King William's Town.  Gert Hattingh and I worked together on a sabotage case at Alice, where a pole was cut and at that, while we were together, he became a, well lets call him a confident of mine and he told me how he had smashed Allan Paton's car windows up at Hogsback.  From that day, Mr Chairman, we were in two different camps.  We never sat together and there was no ways that I would have been involved with Hattingh after that, in fact, Mr Chairman, we involved in a Supreme Court case, because of that issue.  I want to point that if these gentlemen, if somebody had said it was, it was Donald Card? and they are mentioning the name Donald Card?, it's from someone mentioning my name, but not me in person.  65,  you know, it's very difficult now for me to, to, to sort of recollect.  I went  through  old  papers, in  fact  I'd  given my attorney documents and they're not really proper documents, they're documents from newspapers, giving dates of where I was up until about 1964-65, so I haven't been able to get all that sorted out now, but in 1965, Mr Chairman, I was involved when a PAC member, who was operating from Maseru, came back into this country and I arrested him and through information I got from him, I dealt with a lot of issues in Cape Town.  I was in Cape Town quite a lot.  I was in East London., I dealt with certain issues there.  That was 65.  66, Mr Chairman, end of '65, '66, there were two gentlemen who were trying to reorganize the ANC organization throughout this country and I was involved in those cases, but I want to repeat, not in King William's Town.  I did not ever operate from King, I did not come from East London to operate in King, I came from East London to operate in Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria and Durban, but never in .. oh yes, and once in Alice.  I was in Alice in March , 1963 when the pole was cut down there, but never in King William's Town and if those gentlemen say that I, that I assaulted them, definitely a mistaken identity.  I didn't do it and I want to say, Mr Chairman that if I did do it, I would have been the first one to come to this Commission, to the Truth Commission and asked for amnesty.  I would have asked for amnesty because, what did I, what would I lose by  asking for amnesty.  I would have come.  I've asked for amnesty in another matter, but I would have come if there was any reason for me to come.  I could never, Mr Chairman, ask for amnesty when I know I'm not guilty.  I cannot associate myself with anything like that.  I'm innocent, I'm going through pain because of the innocence in sitting here to-day.",

I mean I dealt with people that, a large number of people and there were those, some of those who later, obviously for their own reasons, said that they were assaulted when they weren't assaulted and obviously they do it for a reason because some of them talk to the police immediately and they have to go back and tell the story that they have, that they have spoken and in fact that they, and in fact that they, it was forced out of them.  Many, many people.  I can tell you many people that I dealt with were never touched.  Mr Chairman, can I just tell one story, just to help you on that issue.

He got 25 years imprisonment.  Mr Chairman, he later came up.  I went and saw him on Robben Island and he came to Grahamstown to give evidence and most, a lot of the people were allowed to go, move as they liked.  They were wearing prison garb.  They were serving terms of imprisonment.  Siklese served 25 years imprisonment and because  the others  were walking  around, he  said to  me,  Mr Card, won't  you give  me\n1 night out in the Grahamstown township and I said to him, I can't do that and he begged \nme.  Finally, Mr Chairman, I said to him, OK, you can go.  Oh he said to me, you can trust me Mr Card?.  That was the leader of the PAC in East London and Mr Chairman, I allowed him to go to the Township for the night.  He took off his prison garb, put on clothes and he went off and he came back.

You tell the Magistrate that we have neuked you up, jy sal kak, because you're going to come up, you're going to come back to us.  There are several people who, who would testify to that.  The Magistrate would look at you and he sees that you have a blue eye and he doesn't remonstrate the police about that but  I want to say that we have had Magistrates also who have not been, who have not had any sense of integrity when it came to Blacks because I think they were in the same war.  In a White/Black war.  Now I would like to make that comment.\nMR CARD?: Mr Chairman, unfortunately I, I'm not, I haven't been sitting on a Commission to hear all these stories but I can tell you from my experience with a magistrate and the Judges, there was never anything like that.  I had the highest regard for the magistrates and the judges and let me say that in the times that I had dealings with Magistrates, in fact I thought, on a number of occasions, there should have been guilty.  Certain people should have been found guilty and they were actually found not guilty.  I thought that, as far as I was concerned, justice was one of the departments that you couldn't point a finger at and I might be wrong, Mr Chairman.",

The first one.  Did you know who they were at all ?\nMR CARD?: No, I know that Hattingh was amongst them, but I don't know who, I can't remember who that team was, but I know that there was, I was dealing with a, with a, with  a,  that  very  big  issue in  East London  where we finally  picked  up,  within  a few\nmonths we picked up over 300 well, 300 people, well about 300 people, so I was working \nmonths we picked up over 300 well, 300 people, well about 300 people, so I was working \nthere all the time.

            "Mr Card, just one last question from me.  We can spend the whole day raising questions with you and soliciting your opinions on a number of issues, but your case, as you are perhaps now aware, has become one of the more curious cases, especially in our region for this Commission.  The key question is, who is Donald Card?, what is the truth about that.  There is the picture of, on one hand there is the picture of Donald Card?, the hero, a man who lays his life on the line, sacrificing all in order to take that fateful step of trying, of assisting Donald Wood into exile.  Donald Card? who we have to respect, to admire, to salute for tremendous courage.\n Then there is on the other hand this other  picture  of Donald Card?, if you  can  excuse my words..., Donald Card?, the monster who terrorized freedom fighters in this area.  Old peasant men who were trying to make a statement about the need for democracy in our country.  How they were terrorized and placed under terrible conditions by that Donald Card?.  The key question is who is the Donald Card? before us and as a Commission we have to come to an answer, one way or the other, on that matter.  I've already informed you in my letter  to you that it's not only Mr Yoyo, it's not only these two gentlemen, that there are several other matters which have not come for public hearing, which have cited your name, but I hope you remember the letter that I sent you in that regard.\nMR CARD?: Yes.  Mr Chairman, I'm still waiting for the copies of those letters too.  Mr Chairman, can I say that it's Donald Card?, the realist, Donald Card? and I, in my original statement you will see that I,  I served in the police force and to-day, Mr Chairman, if policemen don't serve the Government that's in power, then you have no Government, you have a problem and I at that stage, not that I was backing the National Government,  I was a policeman.  You must realize, Mr Chairman, it was shortly after the war, 1946, my father was poor.  I couldn't go to University, I had to go and look for a job.  If I wasn't a returned soldier, I didn't get a job.  I ended up in the police force and I decided I would make a success of the police force, which I did, and Mr Chairman, I stuck to my guns.  The law of the country was the law, but then as I became more mature ... (interrupted).  I want to tell you who Donald Card?....",

That's the person you're dealing with, Mr Chairman.  You're dealing with a person who will tell you the truth and I've told you to-day what the truth is.  I'm not, I beg to differ with you, Mr Chairman, I don't see myself as the, I don't know what you called me,  a monster.  I was not the monster, Mr Chairman, I was doing a job at that stage and if I was asked to do a job to-day, I would still do it.  In fact, I wouldn't mind coming back to the police force.
