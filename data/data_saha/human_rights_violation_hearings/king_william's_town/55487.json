When  we  were about to arrive at home, we\nsaw a lot of people in the corner.  We went into our yard, our home's yard.  We saw my mother and my father and children outside.  I saw Goodman amongst the people who were there, I saw Boyi Xhoshini Xnuxnu was one of the people who were there.  They told us to leave, together with my mother.  It was myself, Funeka, my mother and Nogxnena.  We went to Komga.  They surrounded us, telling us to tell them the truth.  We asked the, the truth about what ?  They said, we know.  We told them we don't know anything.  One woman by the name of Nolifisi came.  Nolifisi said that they went to a witchdoctor and it was found that my mother was killing Nolifisi's brother.  She was bewitching Nolifisi's brother.  My mother said that I had to be taken alone.  They asked me why we were not getting married at home.  They said that Funeka and Ginesa were divorced, they came home, they stayed together with myself and my mother.  They took us back.  Noyuepi said that this woman has got to go to a witchdoctor to find out the truth.  They said that we were going to pay out this witchdoctor, to bribe her.  They asked us many questions.  Some we could not answer.  There were four tyres next to me, together with a 5 litre of petrol.  It was myself, my mother, Funeka and Zanele.",
