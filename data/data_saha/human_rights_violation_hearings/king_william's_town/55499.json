We, therefore, will hear of these cases on Wednesday morning.  Secondly, okay, let me put this in English so that if there are any representatives of other people they are also aware. Daniel Paulos Nongena, number nine in our order or proceedings, Makhi Boyi, number ten in our order of proceedings, Mvuzo Johnson Nongena, number 11 in our order of proceedings will all be deferred to Wednesday, because they alleged that the perpetrator was Mr Card and he is not able to appear before us today.\n Secondly, number 14 in our order of proceedings, Nombuyiselo Ntsiba Ngece will be represented, sorry, the perpetrator mentioned in that particular case will be represented by Advocate Redpa and we have agreed to arrange for him to appear before the Commission at 12 o' clock today or soon after 12 today depending on where we are in our schedule.  \n If there are any other legal representatives who are representing alleged perpetrators who have not announced themselves to the Committee, could they please do so and we will arrange for them to be heard as soon as we can agree on the time convenient to both parties.  \n Before we proceed we would like to give reverence to those who passed away.

As a result I did not think that today I would still be alive, because in my life I was never arrested.  I was a child and the boy, I was never arrested.  We were Xhosa boys, we were fighting all the time, but I was never arrested. I then became a man and this was a very painful to me.  My child was run over by the hippo, by the soldiers of the Government.  The person who was driving the hippo was Henna Nagaai.  He was the one who killed my son.  ... we were put in a sack and buried.  We could not bury him properly as a result of the Gqoza regime.  He oppressed us. I suffer\nfrom insomnia as a result of this.  This is how I am.  Okay, I will call a spade a spade.  I cannot digress from this evidence.  My child was murdered.  I went from attorney to attorney.  I had one question, does a person, a human being, murdered and there is no case.  I gave up after a while.  There was full evidence.  I also had clear evidence as my house was also destroyed.  \n I went to East London.  A white man, Thomas, as a legal representative he said I must bring another witness.  I went to Port Elizabeth.  I was trying to find a man who had run away from Puti.  I found this man, Mr Mbambam.  I asked him and he gave me as much evidence as he could.  They were used by Puti to attack people, people who did not want to join the ADM.  I then told him that he said that he was one of the people who were sent through by Puti to attack peoples' homes.  They attacked my home, Mputu's home and another home.  From the third home they stole alcohol and they drank it, they got drunk.  They got to that house, they said that there were soldiers, four of them.  They took the alcohol, went to Puti's and drank.  I gave the Tamacha Police evidence, because there were bullets found in my home.  They said that it was a R4 rifle that shot the bullets.  It was then clear exactly who it was that had been shooting, but there was no case.",
