<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Please come nearer to the mike so that we can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGXOKELA:</span> I attended a night vigil for Bhabha Mlata.  I then left at night, I went home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Please raise your voice, we cannot hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGXOKELA:</span> In the next morning on Sunday, the municipality police came in my home, they kicked the door, looking for me.  I woke up, I opened the door.  They took me to their house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> They then assaulted me, asking me what I was doing in a meeting.  I asked them why were you beating me, they said they were beating me because I attended a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a> They were beating me with sjamboks.  They were kicking me.  I would fall down and they would kick me in my jaws and in my body.  They took me to the rent office, they said that I must give them a statement. </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a> I told them that I can't do that because I know nothing about what they were accusing me.  They then took me to the South African police, they arrested me.  I spent three days there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a> On Wednesday I appeared in court.  I was released on a free bail.  They told me that they were investigating the case.  We then found Attorneys and I was found not guilty in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You said that the police came and they assaulted you in your home.  Who was Bhabha Mlata, the one you attended a night vigil?</p>

<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGXOKELA:</span> I was from Johannesburg where I was working.  I was told that that weekend he was going to be buried.  I attended the night vigil because he was a comrade I knew.</p>

<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Ngxokela, the Dr Brink you mentioned, is he the same Dr Brink we heard about in Khayalethu Hela's testimony?  Khayalethu Hela said that Dr Brink was corroborating with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGXOKELA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Is he the same Dr Brink?</p>

<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGXOKELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Tiny Maya?</p>

<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Ngxokela, the police are supposed to protect the people, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGXOKELA:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> At the time of your incident, were they protecting people in Stutterheim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGXOKELA:</span> No, they were not protecting people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were they interested as the police to protect people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGXOKELA:</span> No, they were not protecting people at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When I look at your testimony and the testimony from people from Stutterheim, am I mistaken to think that the police in Stutterheim at this time, were doing anything they wanted to do to people, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGXOKELA:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> They were not prevented by anything, by anyone from doing whatever they wanted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGXOKELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> They were not working according to the rules of the police?  So you can say that they were making their own laws?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGXOKELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Ngxokela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you Mr Ngxokela, we thank you for appearing before the Commission to give your testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a> We also understand your situation because of this assault as the Commission, we understand that.  All the cases presented before us, we investigate them trying to find out all the details so that we can make a decision of whether this person is a victim or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a> If we found out that the person is a victim, that the person's rights have been violated, we would then be able to inform the President, this is the first step that you've given us your statement and you've given us your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a> When we are making the finding, we will know what to conclude.  For now, we would like to thank you for coming before the Commission to tell us your story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a> Thank you very much Mr Ngxokela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR REDPATH:</span> Mr Chairperson, I represent certain of the people implicated by this previous witness.  If I've understood the translation correctly, he has subsequently increased the number of persons as alleged perpetrators, to seven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a> That is why I have said I represent certain of them.  My position, our position in regard to this witness' evidence is the same as in regard to the previous group of witnesses.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you very much Mr Redpath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR REDPATH:</span> As the Commission pleases.</p>
