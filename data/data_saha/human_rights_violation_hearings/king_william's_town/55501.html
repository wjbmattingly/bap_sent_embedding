<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> We will forward your request to the President of this country.  For now, let me hand over to my Chairperson.  Maybe he's got questions for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> June Crichton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Vuyswa can answer if it is better, I don't mind.  Vuyswa you told us that a civil claim was instituted on this case.  I am not sure if I missed it when you were being asked questions earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a> But can you tell us the name of the Attorney who instituted that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MS NANA:</span> The case was opened in the police station, it was never taken to an Attorney.  Mr Dunkin Qacqa said that he was going to consult an ANC Attorney.  It was the last time we heard about it.  We then went to the police station to open a case, but the case did not go any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And the second question relates to what has been said here about other children being involved in the incident, that was shot at by the same perpetrator.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a> Who are those children?  Do you know them, were they Dyonasi Peter and Nomathemba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MS NANA:</span> It was not Dyonasi Peter.  Peter was the one who reported this incident at home.  He said that my brother was near Nomathemba's home.  The person who was shot was Bongani Calmache and he died.  I don't remember others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you very much, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> We thank you ladies and gentlemen.   We have noted your requests.  Our job is to collect all the information and the requests so that we can forward them to the President of this country in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a> He will be the one who will see what to do for you.  It is not upon us to decide.  If you see us around, don't ask us where is my house, the one I wanted in the Commission.  It is not upon us to decide, it is the President who is going to decide what to do.  We just gather information and we compile a report, forward it to the President so that he can see that he will build a house for certain people, he will see how to compensate you because this incidents happened all over the country, it did not only happen in Stutterheim or in the Eastern Cape, but it happened through the whole country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a> But we promise you that we've listened to what you have said.  When we are compiling our report, they will be included in our report.  Those in authority will see what to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a> For now we thank you, you my go back to your seats, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR REDPATH:</span> I represent Mr Dlomba in respect of the incident just previously testified to.  Quite obviously we have not taken full instructions and therefor  our response has to be the same as has been all day, in respect of the other incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a> However, we are informed that there indeed was an inquest. </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> We are just trying to get our documents, which number is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Is it Ntondo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Dlomba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR REDPATH:</span> It is a specific reference to the witness Godana, number 1717, if my memory serves me correct, number 11 on your list if I am not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> 1717?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR REDPATH:</span> Is that a Mr Godana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Godana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR REDPATH:</span> Yes.  It is in respect of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Eleven, oh, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR REDPATH:</span> It is witness number 11 on your list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Okay, we are on the same page now, thank you.  Mr Redpath, you are representing Mr Dlomba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR REDPATH:</span> Correct.  You will recall Mr Godana made reference to the home of a Mr Vusumzi Kula, who is another one of the persons whom I represent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a> Vusumzi Kula is the person implicated by the old lady, Zamkana and there is a second witness who is not present today, who also had a complaint against Vusumzi Kula, it is one Xhalisile.  These incidents are all fairly closely tied together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a> In respect of the evidence given by Mr Godana, at this stage I can inform the Commission there was an inquest.  I just don't know the outcome of the inquest, I just don't have any documentation, but as before, we pledge our full cooperation, we will not be obstructive in any way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a> We simply require time to prepare and present a fair case on behalf of those implicated.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you Mr Redpath.  The toyi-toyi was going to</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>Vusumzi Kula's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR REDPATH:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> The toyi-toyi was going to Vusumzi Kula's and the alleged perpetrator in this case, Mr Dlomba, then  the allegation is that he shot at the people who were toyi-toying to this house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR REDPATH:</span> That is my basic understanding at this stage, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Okay.  And you are saying that there was an inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR REDPATH:</span> I am informed that there was, yes.</p>
