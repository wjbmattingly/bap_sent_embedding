They then decided that they will pass a Sobukwe Clause so that they can keep him.   It was on the third of March.  On that day I was knitting the jerseys for the children.  He also said that I must cook him dinner, because he was coming back home.  When I went to visit him I was told that he was transferred to Robben Island under the Sobukwe Clause.  I took my younger sister together with her husband and Mr Langa to Cape Town, because we wanted to visit him.  My younger sister together with Fabian Ribeirro and Mr Langa from Orlando East, we went to Cape Town, asked permission to visit him.  We found him there, he was arrested under the Sobukwe Clause.",

He was then taken to Stofberg, from there to Witbank, from Witbank to central jail.  It was where he spent three years.  After that he was then transferred to Robben Island.  We visited him and then we came back.  In November I made an application to visit him together with my children who were in the boarding school in Lesotho.  My twins were four years old at the time.  We went to visit him.  His condition changed at the time.  He was not well.  When I cam back home I  wrote a letter to, Verwoerd was the Prime Minister.  I was then directed to Minister of Justice to write a letter to him.  I wrote a letter that he should be released so that he can  get medical attention at home, but they refused.  We also wanted an independent doctor.\n In 1964 a district surgeon and neurologist and a physician were sent there to examine him.  They said that he was suffering from chronic sinus inflammation.  He was treated.  I then said to Mr Benjamin we must write a letter to a lawyer so that he can get a specialist.  They said that they were treating him, they are not going to allow an independent specialist, because they were giving him pain killing tablets and massages, but in 1964, that was in 1964.  In 1965 they refused.  He arrived in Robben Island in 1963.  He was born in 1924 in December, but in 1964 he was suffering from chronic sinus inflammation.  The Parliament would discuss whether he was to be released or not, but they would refuse.\n In February 1966 they transferred him to Karl Bremer.  They did not tell me.  I heard about this when he came back from Karl Bremer.  He stayed there.  He was admitted under a false name.  They sent him to Karl Bremer under a false name.  I do not know anything about that.  He then came back, he was taken to Robben Island.  They did not consult me about this.  When I went to visit him the following year his condition deteriorated.  I then wrote another letter.  I was writing twice a year asking for his release.  I wanted him to be treated.  In 1965 or 1966 he complained that his food was served with broken glasses.",

The one twin Didane, when we could go to the docks in Robben Island, they would be stripped naked.  We would take some clothing and food for him.  Didane was close to  his father.  Even the father, when he wrote, he would say he misses Didane with his broad smile.  What I realised is that when his father got this treatment after he had been operated on the lungs, when Didane would go to the Kimberley Hospital to visit him, Didane would weep when he would go see his father.  For a year he could not do anything, he started drinking.  Didane is heavily affected.  I request that the new Government, because in 1979 we took Didane to King Edward for  psychiatric treatment.  I request that our Government, the new Government contribute in his rehabilitation.   If he could learn some form of trade, some skill. He has kleptomania.  When he gets to the hospital he just takes down curtains and everything.  He is not well.  Sometimes he would be taken to jail, he would be arrested.  They would release him,  because he would handle himself well.  Shortly after his father died in the hospital he would rob nurses, take their purses and run away.

            "Thank you.  Are there any questions?  No questions.  Mrs Sobukwe, we thank you.  Before you go down, I would like to thank you on behalf of the Commission for having come before us.  We are aware of your age, we are aware of your health, but you sacrificed, came before the Commission to give us a picture of the ill-treatment of Mr Sobukwe whilst he was in custody.  We are aware we are talking to the wife of one of the national leaders of our country and, indeed, we are honoured.  We will look carefully into your evidence.  The TRC has a special hearing that is coming up where we are going to be examining the role of the people who played a role in the medical field.  Your question we are going to put forward before these people, even the Warders that were involved.  If we have any more details that we need, especially his medical files, we will probably approach you for this information.  Thank you.",
