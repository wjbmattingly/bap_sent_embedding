The previous day when he was trying to go to school, he realized that there was  disorder.  He  concluded that  he was not going to go to school that  particular day because there was a boycott on.  I used to, I'd ask him to plant flowers for me.  I told him that my parents were going to come and if they do come, he must phone me.  They came at  about 10, he phoned.  I told him to take them to town by the OK's, I'd meet them there.  I'd leave my work at 12, at 11 I asked them to leave the house and go and meet me at the OK's.  I was going to help my parents with their bank accounts in town.  At 12 I started walking down.  When I started walking down.  When I got towards the OK I saw my parent towards, at the Allied , standing there with a child from our neighbours.  I asked my parents when, where Thembelakhe was.  They said that the police had taken him.  The police came, apparently, when he was giving them tea.  Apparently they pushed him out of the house and left with him.",

I said I'd brought him food and clothing.  They said that he was full.  He'd taken porridge and coffee.  I phoned to pass on a message that my husband should go to the police and find out what's happening.  The next door neightbour's child said that somebody from Grey hospital phoned.  They did not know who it was that called.  The call said that my son was in Grey Hospital.  I went there, he was indeed there.  I was told that I could  not see  my  child.  I  don't  remember the nurse's name.  I insisted that I was going to go, my child belonged to me, not to the police.  I went in.  The police were standing above my child.  The police said that I cannot go in because I'd put him in trouble.  I insisted, I wanted to know how my child was and what had happened.  The policeman refused.  A nurse and a doctor came in.  They said that my child has been transferred to East London.  I was asked to stand at the side.  After a short while they got out.  I tried to call out to my son, he could not speak, he did not respond.  His hands looked paralyzed.  I called out to him, he had a scar, he'd, I could see there was internal bleeding on the forehead.  He wet himself, when the ambulance stopped that was going to transfer him to, to East London, because I said I'd go with him so that when I get to East London  I could align myself with my family, I had family in East London.
