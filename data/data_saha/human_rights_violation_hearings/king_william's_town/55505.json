Then the other brother emerged and they thought that it was Mthetho.  They asked who he was with.  Nokuzola said he was with the wife and child.  As my husband opened the door they asked for Mthetho. My husband said he does not know where Mthetho was.  When he said he does not know where Mthetho was there was a bang on both windows.  There was smoke.  When I started screaming after a lot of, we heard a lot of bangs I saw blood on myself.  When I started crying my husband said I must hide behind the door.

It was a car that was probably wanting to find out what is happening at my house.  Mbulelo, who is the last born at home, when he saw the car he went and told my mother.  My mother said Mbulelo should go and find out what this car is all about, because it is because of these cars that my child no longer stays at home.  Mbulelo went, but he could not write down the registration number.  When I asked Nokuzola if she remembered the faces of these people.  Mbulelo was going to write matric.  Nokuzola thought that Mbulelo had been studying and had gone home late.  The reason why she opened is the door is because they called all my names, even my nicknames.  It was clear that these people knew me well.",

They found my brother and they shot.\n There is a door that leads to the kitchen from the back.  Our bedrooms are aligned together.  Nosipho had a one month old baby.  My sister-in-law's child was two months old.  When she realised that there was blood splattered all over her she was not sure whether it is her husband's or her child's.  As she screamed and cried out, she ran to my father.  My father took her into his room.  The house was on fire by that time.  When we said that it, the whole family was out there, they threw a hand grenade onto the house.  They did not realise that my brother had died.  They thought he was just laying there.  The people from the village came.  My father was trying to stop the fire.  My father slipped and fell.  I am sure that my father's death is due to the injuries that he sustained at that time.

When we got to the ANC offices everybody from Msobomvu was there.  My father was there as well.  I was then told that my brother had passed away.

I did not want to see my sister-in-law, because she was going to ask where my brother is.  She asked as I thought.  I told her that he was in another room in another hospital room.
