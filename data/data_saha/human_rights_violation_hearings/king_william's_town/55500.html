<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRMAN: Boyce Mtyobile and Meyile Malcomeso Siwayi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Mr Chairperson, may I swear them in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">BOYCE MTYOBILE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> This gentleman is complaining that he needs some form of hearing aid, maybe he should put the earphones on.  You may stand up sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MEYILE MALCOMESO SIWAYI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you sir.  Mr Chairperson, they have been properly sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Tiny Maya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Mr Mtyobile can I start with you.  You are going to talk about two incidents, especially in connection with the 10th of January 1990, but your story is not clear before us.  Please tell us what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> It was the 10th of January 1990, I was on duty at Nqongweni, that is where we were camping in a tent.  At the time, there were fights.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a> The people were against the Headmen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Were you a policeman or a soldier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> I was a policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you, please carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> There were four of us on duty, but when the incident occurred, there was only three of us left.  The one had left and said that he does not feel at peace, he would rather go to Bisho where we worked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> The others that were left, was sleeping because we would give each other chances to sleep, four hours at a time.  At about 2 am, when I was waking them up so that I could sleep, I heard something being thrown into the tent and when I tried to figure out what it was, something else was thrown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a> I realised that it was a hand grenade.  I just felt something wet on my feet.  One of my toes was sore as if I tripped over, I hid my head behind the bed, I also felt something wet on my thigh.  I could not take much notice of this at the time.  I felt the person next to me, just to see if he was still alive, we held onto each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a> The noise continued.  The bangs went on.  The dogs were barking.  We realised that as the dogs were barking, the people were running away.   We tried to get out, I told them that it is as if I had been shot.  They ran out.  When I tried to run out, I fell because there as gas that was suffocating me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a> I was dizzy.  I called out to come get me.  The walkie talkie we had, was not working at the time.  We tried to get a house with a phone, we phoned the Control at Bisho to tell them about the incident.  I was then taken to hospital, an ambulance came to fetch me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> So what was happening, who attacked you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> I do not know who was attacking, however there was a rumour that I cannot be sure of.  That is apparent that it was an inside job, it was the other police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was there a reason why you would be attacked by yet other police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> These things would happen, they happened at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What were the reasons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> So that it would appear as if it was one of the political organisations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Had there been such incidents prior to yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> And at the same place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> No, other places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> We will request that you would give us those details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> There was a bottle store that was bombed at Qoboqobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you have an idea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes, this bottle store was bombed out and then we were called.  Then we found out that it was the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Whose bottle store was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Ngwanya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you know the police that set out the mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> We found out when there was a case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You said that you felt a dampness on your feet and thigh?  Were you shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you get help?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> I went to Mount Coke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> For how long?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Two months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you have the documentation you got from the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> I do not have any with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Perhaps one of our investigators will come and ask for these documents.  Did you eventually find out who it is that attacked, because you said you heard rumours that it was the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> I don't have concrete evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was there an investigation, an inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> No, not as much as I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You mention somebody whom you think was connected to this attack because you said the Task Force was under his authority, who are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> The Elite Unit was led by Kwane Sebe and the other by Paulos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Where is Paulos now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is Paulos his first name or his surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you know his first name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> No, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you have reasons for thinking that it was the organisations under Kwane Sebe that attacked you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.  That is what I was told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How did these injuries affect your life?  Are you able to work properly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.  I did not like my place of work.  I made applications for a transfer even before I was injured.  Things were worse, they deteriorated after I was injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Were there reasons why you did not like your place of work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Perhaps you can enlighten us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> My intentions for joining the Police Force was that I would deal with criminals.  Where I worked with the Riot Unit, I did not work with criminals.  I would be woken up in the middle of the night to be asked to go to certain places, it is dangerous, therefore I did not like the job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a> Things were even worse after I was injured.  I requested a transfer, I was not permitted.  I then went to report at Whittlesea police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You would report at Whittlesea police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> When you say you'd be woken up in the middle of the night, what kind of places would you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Places where there is disorder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You said you had been camping to guard Headmen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.  Because the people of the community did not want that particular Headman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was it a norm for policemen to be deployed to villages to guard Headmen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> It was the first time I had heard about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you have a request as you have come before the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> First of all, I would like to know the perpetrators because there is still a bullet in my body that could not be removed.  My body has grenade remnants within it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a> Secondly I lost my job in an unclear manner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You lost your job as a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> In 1991, as I would go and report at Whittlesea because they would not give me a transfer in 1991, I had swollen up around my knee where the bullet is.  I went to the Doctor at Hewu hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a> He X-rayed me.  He said the cause was the bullet in my knee.  If I wanted it to be removed, I would be crippled.  He then gave me a few days leave, sick leave.  When I came back to work, I was taken to trail, they tore the paper from the Doctor and I just sat after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a> In April 1992 I was deployed to Whittlesea, I worked there a while.  In August the was a board of enquiry, then I heard that there was a call that I had lost my job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Were you at the board of enquiry?  Did you defend yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you have a legal representative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Therefore you want us to investigate why you lost your job, is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> I want to see the perpetrators.  If the Commission can, they must find out if I cannot go back to work.  I apply and I never succeed because they think that there is nothing I can do because of  my state of health.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you.  I will hand you over to the Chairperson.  Maybe he has more questions.  Mr Siwayi, good afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> Good afternoon.  First of all, why do you cheat me?  These people gave me earphones, and now I can hear well.  I am going to take these earphones home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you.  This incident that you want to talk about are things that happened to you in Peelton in 1991?  Won't you tell us briefly what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> I hope that what I am going to say is not going to hurt your feelings, because in court they always say I must not divulge everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a> In 1991 I worked for the Headmen.  We were called into Bisho by the Gqozo regime.  They then called us and asked if we wanted the government.  I said I have a house and I have livestock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What boers are they talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> These are the people that killed me, I need documentation, it is in my pocket somewhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Perhaps you can tell us about this stone that you are talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> I am going to tell you now.  So they said that I was destroying these boys, the (indistinct).  The (indistinct) was against the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a> I said that I need the government, a body in authority that I can report to if there is damage in my home, which is why I supported the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a> I had to go give a report.  We said in court that it is the Headmen and the government that is known.  The government does not know anything about the (indistinct).  The (indistinct) boys were against the Headmen and as a head they said I must bring my colleagues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a> I said that they are not there.  They said that I must go to the Magistrate immediately to withdraw.  I said I was not alone, I was with other men.  Then we would go on the Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Who called you to the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> The (indistinct) boys, they fetched me from home.  They said I must bring my colleagues and friends to go to King William's Town to withdraw the case.  I said that the offices were not open on Saturday, they open on Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a> I said that I would go to them on Monday, first thing.  They said I must go immediately.  That is where the dispute started.  Now these boys were attacking me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> When were you injured and why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> Because I could not go to King William's Town on the Saturday or alone, I had to go with the people and report it with them on the Monday.  It was clear that they wanted to attack me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a> This is the time people were being necklaced.  The meeting disintegrated.  Some of them spoke up for me, saying that I was not to be necklaced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a> They carried on arguing.  I stood strong and I said that whoever is going to put the tyre on me to burn me, we are going to die together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a> They cursed me, I cursed them back.  I went home and slept the Saturday night.  In the morning at eleven o'clock the next day, nobody was saying anything any more, my house was just being stoned.  My windows broke down, even the doors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a> There was only one way.  I said my children and my wife must hide under the bed.  They said I must go out, I refused and I said you either will not be able to go into my house whilst I am still alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a> They hit me with bricks, but my Lord was with me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> Yes, my ribs were fractured.  I was taken to the Doctor and I slept at the hospital.  I slept at the clinic and then I was taken to Grey hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a> I stayed there for three days.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was it your ribs that were fractured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> When you came back from the hospital, how was the state of affairs at home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> There were a lot of problems.  When I was being beaten that night, I also fought.  Some of them got in.  They thought that they were going to kill me.  They had left paraffin and petrol behind.  You cannot just put a person alight, even if I come to you now and set a match alight, you will not burn, you need paraffin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a> They tried to set me alight, until their match sticks were finished.  They said that they must go and get some petrol to burn me to death.  Some of them were left behind and the others went and tried to get paraffin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a> The other said they could not be left with me, they were too scared.  I walked around the house, I said to my family they must run away.  I left in pyjamas and went to the police to report the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a> The police kept me until twelve o'clock the next day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was there any damage at home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> Listen, my house was already damaged.  When I came back, the (indistinct) boys were there looking at me.  My children ran towards me, saying I must not come.  The (indistinct) boys were waiting for me.  I said I am going home, there is nothing they can do to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a> I went home.  They came towards me and I was determined to fight.  I went to the Headman's house and that house was set alight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a> Then I thought this is true, they are going to kill me.  I ran away and I would fall, but get up and run.  I ran about 20 metres and I fell down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a> They did not come to me, but they burnt my house down.  I was still in pyjamas.  They left me.  They went and burn down my elder brother's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You were still in pyjamas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> Yes, I did not have any chance to change.  My family also ran in night wear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> When you were being attacked at night, were there people that you saw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> It was full and people did not want me to go to them, I was all alone.  Nobody wanted me with my pyjamas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a> We were given a place in Donqaba by the police in another village.  I did not want to stay with the police, I built myself a place in Donqaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a> This is what I am about here.  My house was burnt down.  I have listed these boys.    It is Tabata who reduced the list, it was the whole village.  What I am complaining about, is that they killed me, even the Magistrate acquitted them even though 26 of my goats are lost and my house was destroyed.   Therefore this list ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is it the people that attacked you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> And there was a court case and they were acquitted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> No, there was no court case, the case was kept on being postponed and then it was withdrawn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Which court was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> In Zwelitsha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> At the Magistrate's court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you remember the Magistrate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> It was Richard, the White man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you.  What requests do you have before the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> This is my request.  Apparently they said that there should be reconciliation, I quite like that idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a> But there should be compensation.  My heart is bleeding.  The law says that a man cannot revenge, I have not revenged, because I respect the government.  I have the right to go into each of their houses, and beat them up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a> But I respect the government.  Even where I live now, it is difficult.  The people don't want me there, they are chasing me away.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you give up your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> Yes, I did.  I did not want to go back to Peelton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you know what the status quo is in Peelton, would you perhaps be able to go back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> I can't go to Peelton now, I built another house.  Do you think I should go back to my enemies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Your requests sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> If the government can, the perpetrators  must be arrested.  If they can't arrest them, but the government must do something for me, I had a huge home and I could not save anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a> They took my livestock, sold it.  If they sold it or ate it.  The policemen that were there at the time, the police did not try to investigate the matter enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a> It is the people that went to King William's Town, toyi-toying that gave us all the trouble.  They came and burnt out houses down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> Therefore I need help from the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> According to our documents you are born on the 15th of May 1915, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIWAYI:</span> That is the truth.  It is just that I am strong, the Lord is with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Sandi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mr Mtyobile, I have questions for you.  I think that we are fortunate that you've come before us as part of the Ciskeian Police Force.  Maybe you can clarify a few things for us in connection with the Ciskeian Police Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a> When did you start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> In 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When did you stop?</p>

<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What was your rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> I was a Constable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were you in Qongqweni?  You said that there were fights, who was fighting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> I am not sure, but the entire village was in disharmony and there was fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a> Our tent was not far from the Headman's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were you given particular instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> We were given instructions to look after the Headman's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were you armed so that you could protect yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> There was teargas.  We had teargas and pistols.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you think that there would be a certain group, resistance group that would attack you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> We did not think that we would be attacked.  We thought that the Headman would be attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You never thought that perhaps Umkonto We Sizwe would attack you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Who was the Commander of the Unit at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Zwahlana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is he still in the Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> I think he is in Port Elizabeth.  I think he is in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You said that there were rumours that it was a certain man who was leading the Elite Unit in Ciskei who sent people to attack you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> It is my colleagues who rumoured this after I had gotten out of hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was this so that you would think that you were attacked by the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> If that had succeeded, you would have thought that it is the ANC that attacked you and then what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> I don't know to hide the atrocity they had committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Perhaps I should ask the question in another manner.   Are you talking about Kwane Sebe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes, he was the head of the Elite.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You say it is him who planned so that you could be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What was his intention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> He wanted us to be anti-ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was there disharmony within the Police Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What was it all about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> We did not know what the Elite Unit was all about, we perceived them as our superiors therefore we were not connected to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> The man that led your Unit, did he work together well with the Elite Unit that belonged to Kwane Sebe?  Were they aligned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> Even if he did not work well with him, he could not voice that out because the Elite Unit was like the government at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Therefore there was no conflict between these two Units?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYOBILE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you for bringing your evidence before the Commission.  We've heard your requests before the Commission - we will look into them.  You can take your seats and we are going to call the last people to the stage.</p>
