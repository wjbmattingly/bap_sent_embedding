<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGQANDU:</span> There was a consumer boycott in our area at that time.  We were fighting against the Councillors because they wanted to raise rent payments.  On the third day, after all this, the boers of AWB came from town.  They were going to take a truck which was burnt down by the community.  The community burnt down the truck because the driver went to the police and the police escorted the driver, so that he can go and buy in town, although there was a consumer boycott.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>People followed, the comrades followed him and we, he, they asked him whether he did not know whether there was a consumer boycott or not.  They told him to leave the truck and the truck was bunt down by the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Who was the owner of this truck ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGQANDU:</span> I don't know who the owner was.</p>

<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You said that they came to take the truck and then what happened ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGQANDU:</span> The community saw them.  We then decided to go to them, asking why they were taking this truck.  Before we can reach them, we heard a gunshot.  I was then shot.</p>

One young boy saw that I got shot, he ran to the school, telling teachers that someone has been shot.  The people then came trying to take me  to the hospital.  This young boy came with a car and then they took me to hospital.</p>

<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR  NGQANDU:</span> The  case  in  King  William's  Town.  It  took  a  long  time.  We  were then transferred to East London.  I was then told in Eas London that the  case  was  withdrawn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> When the case was in court, was it because of the claim you instituted or who was charged ?</p>

<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGQANDU:</span> They were wearing the uniform from the garage because they own a garage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You have a request in your statement.  Would you like to say your request ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGQANDU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Can you please do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGQANDU:</span> I have one request.  I would like the Commission to help me.  I have a young child which needs to be supported.  I cannot work because my leg was shot.  I would find employment to work for a month and my leg would be painful, I will have to go to check-ups.  I was once hired in a hotel in Komga.  At that time I was not aware that there was a bullet in my leg.  I then went to a check-up.  They took the bullet out.</p>

<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGQANDU:</span> Thank you very much.  My friend just slept.  When I asked him what was happening here and when he's questioned in Cape Town, his answer will probably be, he was sleeping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You both have bullets  in your bodies.  We will take this forward.  If we need any other details, we will come back to you.  Thank you.  .</p>
