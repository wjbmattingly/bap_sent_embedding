<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MTHUNZI WELLINGTON TIBI TYAKUME:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Mr Chairperson, he has been properly sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Sandi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.   Mr Tyakume, you are from Dimbaza, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> And you are going to talk about your son, Dumalisile sydney Tyakume?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How old was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> He was 20.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> According to your statement he was shot dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When did this happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> The 27th of September 1977.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Who shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> Warrant Officer Mayekiso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What was happening in Dimbaza at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> There was a rally, a students' rally.  The children were boycotting classes.  Police were called in in King William's Town.  They were forcing the children to go back to class.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a> The children ran around the township, trying to escape the police.  It was break time at about eleven o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did the school children have complaints?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> No, there were no complaints.  It was the Steve Biko boycott.  Steve Biko had just passed away, it was shortly after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> According to your statement, there was a complaint about children being taught in Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> Yes, that too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Tell me all about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> Well, I can't remember well.  I am going to lie to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> As an elderly man, respected man, you forgot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were they not saying that they should not be taught in Afrikaans any more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> I can't remember well, it is probably so.  You forget when a long time elapses.  It has been 20 years, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was Warrant Officer Mayekiso arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> No, he was not arrested.  I had to go to Unit 10 to talk about this.  We went there two days.  I am talking about Zone 10, the Magistrate's court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What happened there in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> Magistrate Marais with Noqaba  did not get any leads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Therefore nobody was charged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> No one was charged, no one was found guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you have a legal representative for advice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> No, not at all.  We just buried our child and that was that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I noticed that when the statement was taken from you, Mr Tyakume, when you were asked if you had any requests, you said that the Commission will see what it can offer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> But I need some form of compensation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that all Mr Tyakume.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> I have nothing to add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Do you see Mr Mayekiso around Dimbaza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> I saw him once, I don't remember which year it was.  His home is in Dimbaza.  I was still working at that time, I had not pensioned, this is before 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> He no longer works there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> No, he had just gone home in Dimbaza.  At the time he was working in Zwelitsha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Tyakume, I will hand you over to the Chairperson, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Can you hear me Mr Tyakume.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> I hear you clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> That's good.  I wanted to find out from you about something that is in your statement where it says that there was one Mthunzi Tyakume who was actually an eye-witness to the event, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And yet you are saying at the inquest they decided to find nobody liable because there was a lack of evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Was Mthunzi at the inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you.  You are Mthunzi, I am sorry?  I see that they have put you down as a witness as well as being a deponent, thank you.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> It is I.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Mr Tyakume, I just want to ask one question for clarity because we did meet and talked.  You said that Dumalisile was your first-born?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Therefore if he was still alive, you would be leaning on him quite a lot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> That is exactly how it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Therefore you said to the Commission that when they meet your needs, they must have in mind that this was your first born child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> Precisely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you Tiny.  Thank you Mr Tyakume for the evidence that you brought before us.  We all know that the police at that time did as they pleased, they were the law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a> We trust that as we are going to take these requests before the President, at least some of your needs will be met.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a> Thank you sir, we hope that at least some of your pain has healed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYAKUME:</span> Thank you sir.</p>
