I saw flames in that house.  My uncle said that I must stay at home, because people were gathering together to go and look at what was happening.  I stayed at home.\n The next morning the police came.  I am sorry, the soldier, Lindile Mashiqa and Luvuyo Matyila.  When they arrived I was in my grandfather's house.  I was eating bread, because I did not eat the whole day.  While I was still eating Luvuyo Matyila came in together with Makayise.  He asked whether I was Mkhululi Sizani.  He was having, he was holding a R4.  I said, yes, I am Mkhululi Sizani.  He said that I must finish what I was eating.  After a while Lindile Mashiqa also arrived.  I think he was outside at the time.  When he got inside he said to me, let us go.  He did not ask anything.  Because they were drunk they took me.  I asked them where are we going.  They said that we are going to Mr Malangeni's house.  They were assaulting me all the time with the back of their R4's.  They beat me in my head.\n We then arrived at Mr Malangeni's house.  I was shown a letter.  They were beating me.  They said that Thembinkosi Jakaza.  They asked me to go and point Thembinkosi Jakaza's house.  We went there, but Thembinkosi was not there, his father was there.  My grandmother told my uncle that these soldiers were going to kill me.  My uncle would go and talk to them so that they can stop what they were doing.  He went to these men.  He told them that this young man was not in this incident.  He was then also assaulted, because these men did not want to listen to him.  I told them that I have a witness, the person with whom I was with during this incident.  Lindile ...",

I did not hear that I have been shot, but while I was still  walking I saw that I was shot and I fell down.  When I was trying to stand up they were beating me and assaulting me with their rifles.  After a while two young boys at about 12 years of age, they passed us and they were called.  They were, these men told them to take me.  We were then on our way to this eye-witness, but unfortunately he was not there.  We arrived at the house of Simphizwe Mabambolo.  The door was locked.  They were beating me at this time.  I could not do anything, they were assaulting me.  After a while then they instructed these boys to take me to Mr Malanageni's house.\n While we were on our way approaching this house they put me down and they told these boys to leave.  I was told to go with, I was told to crawl.  Lindile and Luvuyo would insult me all the time.  They said that I was going to tell  them who actually burnt this house.  When we arrived there I asked for water, because I was thirsty.  Lindile Mashiqa gave me a five litre.  I was forced to finish the water.   Like a monkey I would drink the water partially as some of it would be spilt out.  They then would take my teeth and hit them against a rough stone.  My teeth are damaged.  It was at about three when the police came.  I was then taken to the hospital.  \n As I was being taken to the hospital the police van went via a village.  I was in great pain.  When I got to the hospital, but before we got there I was taken to the charge office and I was identified.  At the hospital they then referred to, referred me to Makiwane Hospital.  I spent four months there.  I just need a glass of water.",
