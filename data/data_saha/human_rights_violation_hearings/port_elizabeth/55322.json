My husband, one comrade was from the Island who died and they went to the funeral at Elinge, when they came back from the funeral, some Boers came by night, middle of the night.\n They persuaded him, they begged him to be their agent \nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 BM MPONGOSHE\nbecause they could see that he was intelligent and they were his friends they said and he said, no, you can't be my friends after I've spent so many years in prison and in Robben Island without my kids and then you came and took my friends and I can't sell my people out after this prison sentence.\n And they begged him, but then they left because he was at the time working at Spices.  When he got there, they said Joseph we have decided to cut down, reduce staff and he was surprised.  Whilst he was having a position like his, how could he be retrenched, one of those who are retrenched.  But then he came back and he related this.\n He was reading this book outside, about 12 they came.  This was from all directions, they came from all directions, looking for him and I said there he was, outside.  They went to him.  They said we would like to see you at Sanlam at two.\n He said, no, I'll go, I know where it is and so he went on his own.  When he got there at two o'clock, apparently he was questioned, according to what he told me about what was happening at the funeral at Elinge.\n And they asked him not to tell lies because they did have a tape, so he said now if you have a tape, what do you want and they started hitting him, hitting him, then they released him at about four, half past four.  So he went to the Doctor (indistinct).  Before he went to the Doctor, he started with a lawyer, then from the lawyer, he went to the Doctor and then he came at about eight.\n And I was wondering why he was not coming back.  So he said (indistinct) can I see you in the dining room, he said I am not going to put up tonight, I will sleep anywhere but \nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n4 BM MPONGOSHE\ntomorrow morning, let's meet in town, but the kids should go to school.\n Indeed I did that the following morning.  Because he suspected that the Special branch would come and fetch him.  So we waited at eight at (indistinct) we went to one lawyer, he explained everything to the lawyer and also that they should arrange for me to be paid my benefits from Spicer.  So I asked him why are you speaking like this, and he said I am not sure of my situation, but I want to leave having made arrangements for my kids.\n So we went to do our groceries and at home I made him some Royco soup and he drank it.

            "I'd like to mention that my husband spent some years in Robben Island in 1964, he stayed there at Rooi Hell, he was expelled after he was released from Rooi Hell and then I was informed that I should go to Elinge.  He was taken to Elinge because they didn't want him to be here any more.\nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n14 MN MARWANQANA\n So I refused to go to Elinge because I didn't want to go there alone.  We really did go to Elinge.   Even though he was\nat Elinge, again he was arrested, he was released after eight months.  He was detained without trial.\n He was arrested again in 1981, he served a sentence but later on they said he was not charged, it was over a year.  After that when he was released, he said he is leaving and then I said if you say you leave South Africa, I will go along with you together with my children.\n I really did go with him.  So we went to, we used passports.  When we got to Lesotho we were accommodated in a hotel.  And the following day he phoned and communicated with Pakamile and Pakamile went to fetch us from the hotel.\n After four days the Boers from South Africa came during the night, it was at 1 am, I could hear that there was a sound outside and then I woke my husband up and said I hear a sound outside, there might be a car outside.\n So he prevented me from peeping through because we were afraid that we could be injured.  My children were sleeping in the sitting room, I was in the room with my little boys.  They kicked the door, the people who were coming inside, but they said they wanted Mavimbela.  At the time they were calling Pakamile Mavimbela.\n There was a White man who had smeared himself and darkened himself, he was having rough on his shoulders.  I think he was at least embarrassed to shoot my husband in my presence, so he chased us away and send my children and I should get out of the room, so we went to the bathroom.\n But my youngest daughter came to the room, he said he would hide and then I said, no we must be together.  So that PORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n15 MN MARWANQANA\nif one of us is killed, we should all be killed.  \n Mpongoshe didn't open his door, my two children went out.  During that time my son had a baby, a seven month old\nbaby.  And then he said I must look after his son.  I was saying he must also join us so that if we are killed, we should all be killed here in the bathroom, but he refused and he went to one of the rooms which was owned by Pakamile.\n There was a sound of gun fire and then everything was quiet thereafter, but they didn't come to the bathroom, so I felt that we should go out.  I started in Alfred's room and I called him Alfred, Alfred and we realised that he is dead.\n So we covered him with a blanket.  We went to another room, there was also a visitor here and he was also shot dead.  We found our brother, Mpongoshe, he was killed also.\n I said to my son I told you about this.  I stated to you that I have been telling you about your laziness, I was thinking that he was asleep.  I informed him that I cannot tolerate this business, I said, why should you sleep whilst we have  been shot, if there were shots?\n I didn't realise that I was talking to a corpse because I could see that he was shot on the head.  The child that I am talking about is Mzukisi.  I could see that they started with Mzukisi because he was next to the door so he fell next to the door.\n Probably they started by shooting him.  We were looking for Thandiswa because we couldn't find him.  You could see that the door was in tatters.  They stole  my husband's watch because they are also thieves.\n I could see that Mpongoshe's room there was some money, so I felt that we should go and look for this money, but we \nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n16 MN MARWANQANA\ncould find that they had also searched the room and took the money away.\n We were still looking for Thandiswa and then I went to \none of the gentleman who was the next door neighbour.  This gentleman accommodated us for quite a long time after this incident.\n But when he assisted us with accommodation, I felt that I should go back to my house and see what was going on.  I informed some of the children who visited us and reported that we are still looking for one of the children.  During that period this child was still seven months, the one that was left behind by Thandiswa.  \n Some of the people came in and stated that they have brought my daughter along, but when I looked through I could see that my child was just behind the wardrobe.  I could see that it was my daughter.  She was also shot dead.\n Then we had the funeral and then we were taken to Tanzania.  One of my children wanted to come back and I felt that I cannot come back again.  I felt that I should rather go further to another area.\n So we went to Tanzania and we stayed there until last year, in 1991.",
