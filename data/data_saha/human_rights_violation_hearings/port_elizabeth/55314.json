I think there are some issues that it might have handled, so we'd like to know whether they had any responsibility that they had taken when your son died.  I want to find out did I get it right when\nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n9 BJ BEKWA\nyour son died, you read this, it was on papers and the university never informed you because we believe the institution was supposed to have informed you about his death.",

They used to say he is a Xhosa and they would be harassed by the other students.  But they used to continue studying although they were having racism amongst themselves.  The Sotho's, the Zulu's and the Xhosa's.  I was surprised why could they accommodate other racial groups, yet they knew that they wanted only the Zulu's to be in that university.\n I am having a problem because my children have not been educated, because my son was prepared to take over from me.

We all share your pain as the South Africans, it was very painful to hear what happened at the university when those five children died at the University of Zululand.\n It was suspected that they were killed by the Inkatha group members and they were killed during the day when there was an occasion.  A day which was supposed to have been regarded as the day to rejoice as it was the graduation ceremony for those who have succeeded.\n Unfortunately the university turned into a battlefield as the students were attacked by the armed group of people when they were unarmed.  He is not the only one, Professor Marupati who is University of South Africa, has also a story to tell because his son died during that incident.\n He is now stationed there at Pretoria, I can remember him as one of the people who suffered also in the same way as you have suffered.\nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n11\n We have a branch of the Commission, I am certain that the investigators and the people who are researchers will try to communicate with those who are in Natal and give them Lundi's name so that we can get clarity of what really happened that day.\n We will try to consider your request, I would not say we will meet your son's wishes and needs, especially for - the promise to support you financially and give you R5 000-00 a month, I am certain that you understand that you are not the only one and there are so many people, because we are going all over the country and there might be more wishes.\n At times we should like it when the people realise it that some of their needs and demands may not be met.",
