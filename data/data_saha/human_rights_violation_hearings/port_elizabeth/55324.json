I think it was very early in the morning, during that am's on Monday, I was staying at Mqnami at the time, at Khoniqa, number 251.\n I had a book and some material of the political organisation.  Some of the books were kept by me and some of the material was taken by the Detectives from the court chamber when it was closed and the organisation was banned.\n We went underground and we were working as volunteers.  The Detectives came and confirmed that I was Stephen and I agreed and admitted that I am.  They asked me if I was a volunteer and I denied that.\n They searched the house and they found some boxes.  They wanted to know who was the owner of the boxes and then I said Mr Bennie is the person who requested me to keep them.  They wanted to know how could I keep these boxes if I was not a volunteer.\n They started assaulting me and then I was taken back.  I think I became unconscious because I cannot remember what happened thereafter.  I regained consciousness at about five am, I was alone, I didn't know where I was, but I could feel that my body was aching.\n There is the other one who is my relative, who is a cousin to my mother, Mazwani who was not there.

In as much as you, the older generation, were getting inspiration from the youth, such as you have described in 1986, when you were saying you were feeling the thunderous march of the youth behind you when you felt you had the courage to face the enemy, those very young people got inspiration from all those stories that they used to hear about Amafolandea, about the end plan and all such stories which were being told over and over and over again by those who were pioneers in the history of our struggle.\n When I looked and I calculated, you are telling us the story of your first suffering which took 32 years ago.  32 year ago, but you still remember those incidents as if it happened yesterday.\n Because it was an incident that not only was intended to deny you the dignity which you deserve, but it was also an incident that was intended to deprive you of your inalienable right, the right to freedom.\n When I look at you, I see another Ray Mglaba, another Mandela, another Coveren Begi, because you operated in their types.  \n There are so many of the people that we can quote who are now senior citizens who have also had a contribution to the struggle, I think we should also wish that they could also come forward, because you are one of the unsung heroes.
