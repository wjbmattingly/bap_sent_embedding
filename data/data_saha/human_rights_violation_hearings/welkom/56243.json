            "Well, I want to thank the Reverend Peter Roberts for his wonderful prayer and support for the witnesses because they need the strength.  All, I greet you all in the name of our Lord and at this moment I want to welcome the following groupings to this hearing.  Is there any government officials who are here?  We want to extend our welcome.  We're just sorry that the Premier could not be here but he has sent his apology that he is here in spirit but physically he's overseas.  We also want to extend our welcome to the NGOs who are going to be here this morning, faith groupings, that is, churches and other religious faiths who are here, the media and the press, the witnesses and their families and all those people who come from the community to support them.  We also want to welcome our translators who are seated there behind that corner and having said so I want to say that there are these things which are here which should be used by those people who don't understand, here the interpretation, there you have got some channels.  If you set that thing.  If it says channel 1, it means it is Afrikaans.  If it is channel 2, it means that it is English and in channel 3 we get Lesotho, Zulu and Xhosa with these things.  They're going to help you so that if we speak English the translator will be doing it and you can hear in your own language and you'll be helped by people if you don't know how to operate it.  And these are the second hearings in the Free State.  You remember that some time back ago we had the hearings in Bloemfontein and now we're having the second hearings in the Free State.   This is the process we shall be following.  Whenever we finish a session, when we have to move out it means that it will be the witnesses first will move out and when they move out we all stand and we remain silent and quiet to give them the dignity and to give this affair the dignity and again when they come in, if we are seated, we stand also to support them in whatever they want to do.  Please observe that process.  Here we came with the statement-takers, that is to say if there are any people who have not submitted their names as witnesses or victims to be, we came here with statement-takers.  You can see the statement-takers and so you tell them your story.  They are here with us.  Now, I want to introduce the panel which is with me here.  On the ... (inaudible) ... right is Professor Simangele Magwaza and immediately to my right is Mr Mdu Dlamini and on my left is Mrs Regina Gcabashe.  This one is quite liked because she is Sotho speaking.  In fact she'll be our chaplain if we don't understand some of the things because the three of us are Zulu speaking and she's bilingual.  She speaks Sotho and Zulu.  She'll be helping us as we go with the business.  Now I shall ask the briefers to help us by bringing forward the first witness.  I forgot to introduce myself.  I'm Dr Mgojo from Durban.  Also among us here from our Truth and Reconciliation staff, we've got the co-ordinators, we've got the Free State co-ordinator who has just been co-ordinating all the things, Moses Pitso(?), which means that if you've got some problems, you need to be getting in touch with him.  And here in Free State too we've got Reverend Bosman, the one who is the briefer and we have  got our own briefers from Natal and other staff member, logistics, etcetera.  So you are well cared for if you've got some problems.\nEXCHANGE OF GREETINGS BETWEEN CHAIRMAN AND WITNESS",

He was shot by Pakathi's group.  It was when they were coming from the Roman Catholic church going to attend a meeting of the ANC at the church.  At the time when he left I was not sure at what time but what I've learnt is that it was true that I should go and look where my son was shot.  Then I got the fact how many people were there.  Then people said there were many Kombis and they were chasing these people from the Roman Catholic church when they were singing in the morning and then they chased them.  Those people who were chasing them were Sinqani and company.  They were chasing our children with the Kombi.  I only saw the place where he fell but I was not sure how he was assaulted.  They chopped him on the head.  Then I picked him up there.  Then I took him to the hospital.  At the hospital they sent him back to me.  They stitched him only.  When this boy arrived at home whilst he was sleeping I could see him jumping from the bed in his room.  Then I asked my wife, \"Do you find that there is something going on in the house?\"  When I went to look for my son, he was shivering.  Then I took him to Dr Zazi(?).  This doctor told me only one thing.  He has the chance of living which is 50 to live 50 per cent to  die.  Then I was forced to take this child.  This doctor gave me a letter to take him to Beranomi(?) right away.  I took him to hospital called Beranomi.  Then I went out to look for transport because I was at home.  I was unemployed until even today.  I took this child to Bloemfontein.  I was helped in Bloemfontein.  Even now he's still epileptic and I've no hope that he will do anything in his life.  He's just a man who's going to be just in the house.  That's the problem I have with my child.  He is a person who's just confined to be in the house and he always has fits.

You wrote the statement and the statement you wrote is about the violent death of your son Ndoyisile Albert Xhamfu who had gone into exile to join the ANC.  What we don't have about your son in this statement which I think we don't have the correct date of birth.  In the statement is says he was born in 1986 but I know he wasn't born in 1986.  When was your son born?  What was the date of birth of your son?  ",

            "  In 1986 my son Ndoyisile was attending school at  Lebogang and he was doing Standard 10 during that year.  Then in July, that was on the 14th, that was the last time that I saw him and I heard later on that they had skipped the country and they had gone to Lesotho.  We got the message later on after they had skipped the country.  At the time he was being harassed by the police and we were having absolutely no peace at home and at the time in 1986 some were arrested during the state of emergency and I think Ndoyisile decided to skip the country then.  We stayed up to 1991, that was the first time that I heard when we were told in 1991, we got a message from the offices of the ANC, that was in January but I don't remember the date quite well but it was in 1991.  Mr Xhamfu was not present on that day and I had to rush off to the ANC offices and as I was still preparing myself to go to the Welkom branch, certain members of the ANC came and they picked me up.  They wanted Mr Xhamfu as well to come but there was no transport.  So I decided that I should be the one who goes there.  I told him to be left behind because there was no transport.  I went to the offices and was told to speak to a certain man called Jani Mohapi and Jani Mohapi is the present mayor in Bloemfontein.  It was myself together with other ANC members.  And when we got to Jani Mohabi, Jani Mohabi was surprised that we did not know that my son had died.  And he told me that at the time that he got arrested by the Bloemfontein police, when he got into the police station, the very same police who arrested him told him that Jani as well as David had been arrested and that was the last time that I spoke to Jani and he related this story to me.   And when I came back I told my husband together with other members of the ANC.",

            "  I'll just give you an explanation as to how this happened and what happened.  During the year 1991 I was working at a firm called Reebeck and I was a driver there.  As I was still working as a driver in that particular firm that was the time when the President, Nelson Mandela, was going to be released from Robben Island and that was the time that the exiles were supposed to be coming back into the country.  And as we were seeing most of the exiles coming back into the country we also had expectations that our son would also be amongst the ones who were coming into the country.  Unbeknown to us it wasn't going to be like that.  Our son had died a long time ago and nobody notified us as to his death.  And the first time we heard about this we were traumatised emotionally together with my family to such an extent that as I was employed as a driver I was involved in an accident where I hit a pole at work because I was not concentrating and that's how I lost my job.  Up till today I'm not working.  After I had lost my job, just a few days thereafter, after we had heard about my son's death, we took further steps to try and establish cause of death.  Up till we got to Bloemfontein, I went together with other members of the  ANC and I believe that was in March 1991 when we went to Bloemfontein with the ANC members.  When we got to Bloemfontein it was myself as well as the other members of the ANC but my wife was not there because she was working at that time.  They told us that there's a certain man by the name of Jani Mohabi who had just returned from exile.  He was actually from Robben Island.  And he is the one who had come with this message that Ndoyisile had died and he had died in 1987.  During all this time we were not notified.  We did not know anything about my son's death.  We got to know about my son's death from Jani Mohabi in 1991.  And I wanted him to explain to me as to how my son was buried.  He told us that we should go to the funeral undertakers that is Goodwill Funeral Undertakers.  We got to Goodwill Funeral Undertakers and the gentlemen we got there told us that it was true that my son had died and was buried in 1991.  His corpse was given to him by the State so that he would be buried as an unknown body.  He continued to bury my son.  He also gave me the grave number as well as his name, Ndoyisile Xhamfu.  I further asked this gentleman as to why they had given the body to him because it was an unknown body but he also told me his name, that his name was Ndoyisile Xhamfu.  How did it come about that he knew his name whereas he was initially labelled as an unknown body.  He explained to me that he only got to know my son's name later on and that he was from Welkom.  He asked me as to whether I was his father.  I said yes, I was Ndoyisile's father.  He asked me as to what I wanted him to do.  I said I wanted my son's remains and I want to take them with to  Welkom so that I can give him a decent burial.  He said we should go to the police station because it had some to the surface that this was not an unknown body.  His name was known.  His parents had come and they wanted the remains.  So he was not refusing.  He said we should go to the police station to have the remains exhumed.  We proceeded to the police station which was situated there within that residential area and we spoke to a certain Sergeant Ntamo.  Sergeant Ntamo took me to certain places where I was filling certain forms and I was told I should submit my name and I should sign certain forms.  We went to a police station which was situated in town.  I think it's the very last Bloemfontein police station which is at the south of Bloemfontein.  He retrieved a certain file.  It was a big brown envelope which had my son's photos in it.  And I was listening to him when he was calling this file number.  He said this number is 77/87 and they looked for the file.  They retrieved it and they have it to him.  He opened up the envelope and he took out my son's photos and he allowed me to have a look at them and I saw that this was my son.  I identified him from the photos.  He was naked.  I could see his face and I could see his forehead which had a bullet-hole in it.  And I looked at his whole body.  It had so many bullet-holes and it was apparent that he had been shot more than 200 times in the body.  I asked as to how it happened that he was shot so many times because it was sufficient for him to be shot only once in the head and this sergeant said to me, \"These were not the bullets but it was a hand-grenade that he was having with him.\"  I told them  that I did not know how a hand-grenade works but I believed that I could not recognise him if he was blown up by a hand-grenade and I did not want to believe that he had been blown up by a hand-grenade.  And I asked as to who had shot my son and how many people had shot my son but he could not give me an explanation and he said, \"You have seen your son's photos.  Now you should go.\"  And we moved out of the police station.  I asked them to give me one of these photos so that when I buy my son I should be able to make an obituary which has a photo of him and they told me that the law did not permit them to give me any of his photos and I left without anything in my hands and we came back to Welkom.  We decided that this Goodwill Moshai was going to tell us after the remains had been exhumed and we would take the bones to Welkom for the burial.  I was notified later on and I went to fetch my son's remains from the mortuary.  I looked at the bones.  The first one that I took was the skull.  I took the skull and I had a thorough look at it and I saw that these were my son's remains because this skull had this bullet-hole in it.  And I knew his dental formula and I looked at his mouth and I saw that these were his teeth and that's how I could identify my sons remains.  And I took these bones and brought them with to Welkom with the help of the ANC.  That is about all I can say.  That is all I know about my son's death.  Now I would request this honourable Commission to try and find out - I want to know as to who was there in the house - that is the house in which he was attacked or shot dead.  Who were the killers or who was the killer.  I would like this Commission to try and find out this  information because I am desperate.  I want to know more about my son's death.",

Maybe his case too needs to be attended to and his case needs to be referred to, as I said before, to our co-ordinators who are here so that they can see what can happen with him.  Baba, your story is very painful.  It's a common story of many parents in our country who had children especially sons.  Very painful indeed to have our son killed somewhere and buried and you hear after a long time that your son is buried.  There is nothing which is precious to a parent like a child.  It reminds me of the old story in the Bible when King David cried bitterly and he had to fast even for the son who wanted to kill him.  His own son wanted to kill him but when he heard that his son was killed he cried bitterly - that was Absolom - showing how much emotionally the parents can be about their own children when they are killed.  We thank you for coming.  We feel the pain with you.  We're experiencing it now ourselves and, as the Commission members have just said, we'll to see that  your requests are taken to the President for consideration.

As a minister of religion this gives me a picture of that story in the New Testament where it is said that when Jesus was about to die he knew that he was going to leave his mother alone and he found a son for the mother.  That was John.  He said, \"Woman, behold your son,\" and then he looked at the son, the new son given to Maria and he said that, \"Son, behold your mother.\"  So that is what I see today that although Oupa was the friend of Jafta, when Jafta left Oupa took the place and became your son to stand with you when you testified and this is great.  It is also fulfilling that ...  (inaudible) ... saying.  We say that a friend in need is a friend indeed.  Many people with many friends, they run away when the other friends need the help.  So this is very highly appreciated what Oupa's has done to come with the mother to support her so that the mother could also have the courage to say something about the death of her son.\nMRS NTOMBELA",

You say here\n\"I would like Elias Tsabole to explain why among all the Comrades present at the time he shot my daughter.  I am prepared to forgive him but I'll never forget.\"\nThose are very heavy words which come from a very painful heart and yet a heart which is prepared to forgive.  We will try by all means.  One of the things in the Act is that perpetrators should come forward and tell the stories why they did things which are so horrible and if they don't do it, the Commission has all the powers to subpoena them, to force them to come forward and tell the story.  It would appear to me that even people like Captain Hugo, who is mentioned in many stories here, should come forward and tell the stories why he committed so many crimes killing people because if he doesn't come forward he will have to be forced to come forward and say that.  So it is in that spirit that we'll also try as the Commission to see that Elias Tsabole fulfils your wish to come forward so that, as you've already said, you are prepared to forgive him.

And at that time they put the cars into the yard and the lady of the owner of the house had burglar proofs and they did not want to get in through the windows.  Pule refused that the door should be opened up till such time that they threw teargas canisters inside the house and they realised that the door was not being opened despite the fact that they had thrown teargas canisters inside.  They broke the door and they were told that there was a child inside the house who was being suffocated by the teargas.  And all the policemen were standing at the door having guns with them until such time that all the people had to vacate the house.  And Pule himself came out of the house and he tried to run away and they held him.  They asked him whether he was Pule.  He denied that and said he was Thabi so he was not Pule and he went inside and he put on his trousers and everybody went out as well as the owner of the house.  At that time Pule had already run away and they asked him as to whether he was Pule.  The owner of the house denied and said, \"I'm not Pule.  Pule has run away.

One of the policemen said they should have looked at me and they should have looked at another person who looked like me.  That would be Pule.

Why do you bring him back home.  Why don't you take him to the hospital where he would be taken care of?\"  They said, \"He is very scared.\"  They said, \"Please, don't trouble us.  He's just a mad boy.\"  And I went back home.  I didn't know what to do.  We used ropes to fasten him.  I called an ambulance to take him to the hospital.  I met a doctor who was examining him.  I said, \"Doctor, I don't see any reason to keep this child at home.  He doesn't want to see anybody.  He's just fighting.  He's very aggressive.  But, you know, we can overpower him.  We cannot spend out days with this person at home.  Can you please transfer him to Bloemfontein immediately.  Don't give us any further date.\"  The doctor agreed and they fastened him and he was sent to the hospital.  We told the doctors that we don't want him to leave alone.  We want to accompany him.  I think ten doctors examined him until the next morning they retransferred him from Orange Hospital to  Pilinomi Hospital where they wanted to check as to whether he wasn't attacked by a stroke.  His body was numb and we were then told to be transported by an ambulance.  On our arrival here in Welkom I called the hospital to confirm what the doctors say.  They said, no, he didn't have any stroke but he was severely beaten but he should be then taken to Oranje Hospital.  And then he spent the whole year at Oranje Hospital.  I was called now and then by the policemen telling me that I have to go and sign for his treatments.  There was nothing they were giving me, not even the transport.  I used to spend my own money to go and see my son and sign all those documents.  And every time I would give the hospital a call to enquire about his health.  We were worried we thought that he would die but I'm glad that he survived.  He couldn't eat.  He was just helpless. The doctors said to us, \"Please take him.\"  The treatment cost was up to R6 000,00.  They said I should take him back to Welkom and should take care of him.  We brought back home and I took him to the provincial hospital where he was getting treatment until such time that the doctors agreed to examine him front Bloemfontein.  They come every month.  And the second time he was struck by this sickness, in the forms that I've filled in they asked me when was it the second time that he was attacked by this sickness and I did indicate.  We keep a very good eye on him.  We don't want him out of our sight.  Every time he is attacked by this we have to take him to Bloemfontein.

When you were telling your story I could see that you were remembering most of the things which you have given in your statement and that was wonderful indeed.  You are very dynamic.  And you have just said now that you believe in God.  The God you worship is a God of miracles.  If you believe that your son will be cured, I'm definitely sure as the sun rises from the east and sets in the west, if you believe, that the almighty God is going to help you through your faith.  We have heard this story and again it is very depressing to find that most of the things which have happened here, they have happened through the hands of the police.  I mean, police are the people who should be protecting people, protecting people's lives.  When we grew up, when you saw a police, you saw a friend.  When you saw a police, you saw security.  But during the time of the apartheid regime, police became enemies of the people and they became murderers of the people.  I want to say what I have said again that people like Hugo have  /been",

They forget the vows which they made that till death sets them apart.

You have been quiet, attentive, listening, sharing the pains with the witnesses and we do appreciate this spirit and I want to thank you all here, those who came too just to be present.  You know, when you are here it gives strength to those people who are telling their stories and also it is healing you who are listening because we've been traumatised, all of us, nobody's not been traumatised.  I want to register my thanks to you and also I want to register my thanks to the media, our brothers who are here with us helping us in what we are doing.  We  appreciate that very much.

We are coming back again tomorrow beginning at 9.00am and we are also still inviting those how can make it to come back again and hear other stories and also do invite some of your friends to come and listen, to come and be involved in the process of the healing of the nation.  And again there are statement-takers - in fact we have ordered two more statement-takers.  When my colleague Mdu Dlamini was walking around he was told that the work is becoming too much for those we brought here because people are responding very much positively and then we had to order two.  There're some who are coming from Durban to help others here in taking more statements because this thing goes up to the end of the year.  It's not the last time that we come here.  Even those who do not appear, we may still come back here if there are statements.  And there's something I forget to say.  These things please, don't take them away with you.  They'll be useless if you take them away with you.  When you leave, you need to leave them there at the door with the gentleman there and then tomorrow you will pick them up again and use them.  Don't take them home.  They are useless if you take them home.  Now we are going to close this session and I'll just ask somebody just to lead us in a short - I'll do it the African way.
