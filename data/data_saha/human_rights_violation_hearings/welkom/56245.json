For the Magistrate to say that he cannot make any decision about the case when one of the perpetrators had already agreed that he shot a boy in a pink shirt, when the evidence was there, it would appear that the law at that time was for the perpetrators and not for the victims.  And I believe that is what is exciting about the Truth Commission, that all those cases which favour the perpetrators, there is an attempt that the victims should get a fair trial on what happened before.  We thank you. As some of the members - my colleagues have already said, that we shall try by all means to follow up these cases so that we can see that justice is done.  You are indeed a very strong person.  You have already said that you are quite well.  We appreciate that, but myself I will suggest that you also try and get a help from some of the psychologists, because you are traumatised.  The only thing is that you are very strong.  Some people are very strong, but you are traumatised.  Even now a person can see that you are traumatised by the death of your child, and we don't blame you for that.

(Pause)  In 1995 on a Sunday afternoon the same guys, the same men who was present when Andrew was murdered, except for Reginald Buffel, who was not there, my sister's son, Cassius and Mhlahoti were stabbed and chopped by them in front of my door, and he actually fell down in my yard.  My eldest son of 16 saw this happen.  I was lying in the room and he came and called me, and he told me, \"Mother, come and have a look.  Uncle Marlin is busy killing Cassie.\"  And when I was there he was actually smothering in his blood, and that's when they were running away.  And they said, \"We've killed another one of the kaffirs of the Petruses.\"  I don't know what they had against the Petruses.  Was it because Roland Petrus had shot Dewitty, their friend, or what was happening, but I deduce from this that that was probably the reason why.  There were two police vans that Sunday afternoon, but nothing further came of that matter either.  My other two sisters - my other sister's two sons had also been stabbed.  Also by Dewitty's brother, who had been killed.  And also Bana Woods, Marlin Woods' brother, and nothing came of those cases, either.  I myself took them to the hospital, the two brothers.  And I feel that I don't understand why the police acted like this against the Petrus police (sic), not having been able to do anything to catch Andrew's murderer up to this point.  Last year - no, 19th of March this year Ivodia came and told us that she had seen what had happened, and I myself,  /my sister,",

I asked him as to why he said that.  He said he could not understand whether I was a policeman or a community worker, because at the time that the community was dissatisfied with the services of the police, and when they were attacking the policemen's houses, I was able to walk freely amongst the members of the community.  Why weren't they attacking me?  He felt that I was colluding with the community against the police, and he told me that I had to choose between being a policeman and a community worker.  My reply to him was that I could not understand what he was saying.  Why people were not attacking me was totally unknown to me.  I did not know the reasons why they did not attack me, but according to me was that as a policeman I was not harassing them, terrorising them, or traumatising them in any way, I was just doing my job as a policeman.  And at that time the Three Million Gang was conducting a reign of terror in the residential areas.  At times when I was at work they used to tell me that I was lucky, because at times I would come across the people who were conducting the unrest, and some of them were carrying an assortment of weapons, and at times I would be able to arrest members of the ... (incomplete - end of Side A, Tape 4) ... and arrest the perpetrators or the carriers of the weapons.  There was a certain prosecutor, Mr Pienaar.  He - she was the one who was conducting the Three Million Gang cases, and most of the time they would be released or acquitted.  And whenever they had to attend court there would be specific instructions from the station commander that when they were supposed to go to court they had to be transported in police vans to attend court.  And whenever they were coming from court they had to be taken in police vans back to wherever they came from.  And they would help them to be released from prison.  They were actually safeguarded by the police.  And I did not collude with what they were doing.  I was always questioning the police behaviour towards the Three Million Gang.  In most cases when they go to attend court it would be due to harassment of the members of the ANC or school kids, but the ANC members were not being escorted by the police whenever they had to attend court.  The station commander had an altercation with me and we always had problems.  I think that is why he was asking me as to whether I wanted to be a policeman or a community worker.

We went on a march as the Mokeng residents, and when this commission came to sit it was being led by Deroux.  We submitted statements as well as evidence and testimony.

I did not know what to do at that juncture because I was not notified about the case.  Then there were certain white people from Britain.  They also took statements from me and asked me as to what had happened.  They went to the charge office to inquire as to what became of my case, and when they were still there they were told that they were still conducting inquiries with regard to the case.

My brother was a writer, and one of the books he has written is Class Struggle and Racial Conflict in South Africa, even if I don't have a copy of it now.  My brother had contact with the President, the South African President.  In one of his letters which he has directed to my sister-in-law they were still corresponding, and I hope that the President of this country knows him.  In his life he was a person who was prepared that South Africa should be liberated, and that it should not be liberated under any conditions.  When South Africa is liberated all people should be liberated in all spheres.  There is a lot of correspondence, even if much of it is not important, but it shows what character he had.  It shows that he was a person who is courageous, even though he was assaulted by whites, when he left this country.  What they did, they didn't assault his spirit and his mind.  His mind will live.  It will live in his books which he has written.  Another thing which I am requesting is that the Commission should make investigations, that after his death that apartment where he was staying all his belongings disappeared.   Even up to now we don't have anything.  What we have is only his corpse, with so much expense.  We requested funding from the ANC and no organisation was able to help us to bury this soldier who has fought for the liberation.  So I am asking that the Commission should make investigations that - the little information we have is that when he left Dar-es-Salaam they went to Moscow, where they opened an office.  Then from Moscow they went to New York.  Then they opened an office there.  I hope that there are sensitive documents which may be helpful to this country, which may have disappeared and can be found, if these people who are in their possession may be found ... (incomplete - end of Side A, Tape 5) ... them at all.  Therefore we ask the Truth Commission to make some investigations about his life.  The information we have is that he was a person who was very quiet, a person who didn't want to speak about the organisation.  He was always talking about the meeting when he was in a meeting, therefore among friends he was not talking about the organisation.  We hope therefore that he was a soldier, that the Commission should investigate about his life.  I thank you.",

            "Fellow citizens, we have come to the end of the hearings which took place during these three days, and we have seen that in these hearings mothers and their children, especially the sons, were very much involved.  This story reminds me of the story which happened almost 2 000 years ago, the story of a man of Nazareth whose name was called Jesus.  The people during that time found themselves in a very similar situation, when some of the people from the community had colluded with the oppressors of the time and were killing their own people.  As a result one of the victims was this man Jesus himself.  I am reminded of his words, that when the women were crying for him as a young man, thirty three years old - they were crying for him.  They were seeing this young man, as these young men we have heard about here, they cried for him because he was the hope of his parents and the hope of the nation.  And this man Jesus said that, \"Women of Jerusalem, don't cry for me, but cry for your children.\"  So I am not surprised when I see the mothers crying for their children who have died, nipped from the bud when they are young.  Their blood has become the seed of our liberation.  Maybe this must be saying something to our Government, because the youth died for this liberation, and it is very depressing when you see young people all over in the townships without any jobs, and some of them are saying that, \"What did we fight for?  We fought so hard.  Some of us died, and we have no jobs.\"  I would hope that in future certain opportunities will be opened to facilitate the young people with expertise so that they can enjoy the liberation they fought for.  We want to thank them for the sacrifice they made.  We want to thank their parents for having given birth to these great soldiers, who were very courageous to stand firm and die for their liberation.\nNow, having said so, I need now to thank all the people who have participated in these hearings in different ways.  We had some of the Government officials who came here, though they were very busy.  We had some of the non-Governmental organisations, NGOs, who came here and supported these hearings.  The churches and other faith groups who have been here.  The media, that is to say TV and the press.  I always calls those are the missionaries who spread the good news, so that what the President wants to achieve, maybe achieve.  The media is a strong agent for this, so that even those people who cannot afford to be here, when they read the papers, they see the TV, they can become involved in these hearings.  We thank them very much for this.  We want to thank the police for the security.  Our police, these are our police, because they are the police of a new Government.  We want to thank them for all what they have done here to help us in whatever we wanted to do - security, etcetera.\nWe want to thank the witnesses who have become bold, and were courageous to come forward, supported by their families and their relatives, and the support from the communities who came here to be with them.  We want to register our thanks to those people.  We want to thank the translators, who have used their skills of knowing even those languages some of us don't know, that they could translate for us, so that if they speak Sotho we can understand, if they speak English we can understand, if they speak Afrikaans we can understand.  We want to thank  you good people there.  I know that you have been suffocated there, because it is so hot where you are, but you could stand for it for three days.  \nWe want to thank the caterers who have been providing us with the eats, and they have been very good indeed, and they have been very friendly. There is nothing good when you see a person giving you food with a smiling face.  We want to register our thanks to them indeed.  \nWe want to thank the support groups, the psychologists who have been here, and social workers and other counsellors, who have been helping our people after they have given their testimony.  We thank them very much.\nAnd finally we want to thank the TRC staff in their different categories, who have made it possible - starting from those in this region, preparing for these hearings, and those who joined them later to see that these hearings were a success.  We want to thank you very much.\nAnd we hope that when you leave again you will leave those things, because they will mean nothing for you even if you take them, but we need them because we are still going to have many hearings.  I hope you are going to encourage the people where you come from to please come forward, those who were tortured and had relatives killed, to come forward and tell their stories.  We will still come back to the Free State.  The TRC finishes at the end of next year.  We are encouraging people to come forward and tell their stories.\nIn closing this I think it will be very relevant for us to sing that great prayer, the prayer of our fathers and our grandfathers and our forebears, Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, and then after that we shall disperse in peace.   \n/TRANSCRIBER'S",
