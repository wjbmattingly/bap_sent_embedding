In the month of October two young men who were working for the special branch, their names were Robert Mowale and Walter Tabanelo, they entered there and told me that, \"We need you at the OK upstairs where we have offices  there.\"  Then I asked them, \"What is the problem because you see that I'm on work and I'm only working for the commission.  If you take me upstairs I'm going to lose my clients.\"  Then they said to me, \"We want you.  We're no more asking you.\"  Then I told the manager that I'm going up with these people.  Then I went there with them.  Upstairs I met Roland, the person who was in charge of the special branch, the other one is Prins and then Mowale and Tabanelo.  Then Roland said to me, \"I'm calling you because I learnt that you are a communist and a member of the ANC, that is why I need you here to come and tell me.\"  Then I said to him, \"Sir, it is true that I'm a member of the African National Congress but I'm also a member of the small group called Society for Young Africans and some of the people you're working with, we were with them in the membership of that organisation.\"  Then he asked me, \"What do you remember what happened during that time?\"  Then I said to him there was nothing wrong which I did.  We would only go to have our meetings and there was nothing wrong which we're intending to do.  Then Roland told me and pointed at me with a finger then he said to me, \"You and me, we're going to meet at a crossroad.\"  Then I said, \"That is better to meet at a crossroad because I know that there is noting wrong I'm doing.\"  Then in 1972, that is between September and November, I was at my friend's place and many friends of mine were teachers.  We were sitting there peacefully enjoying ourselves and then one of my friends came there who has already died.  Then he said to me, \"Lawrence, you're sitting here peacefully and entertaining yourself.  The special branch are  searching for you.\"  Then I asked him, \"What did I do?  I don't understand why they're searching for me.  Are they looking for me because of my past activities?\"  Then Lawrence went away.  Then at sunset I said to my friends, \"Let's everyone go to his place.\"  When I arrived at home my wife said to me, \"Are you coming at this time?  The special branch were looking for you.  Then they told me that on Monday you must come to the charge office in the police station.\"  Then on Monday I had my breakfast and prepared myself then at half past twelve I went to Seiso, then I entered the church office.  Then I told them that I've come because of the call the SBs have made.  Then they made me to sit down.  It was at about ten past two the SBs arrived.  Then they said, \"Where is he?\"  Then this one who is called Mowale came to me.  He handcuffed me.  Then I said, \"I'm feeling the pain.\"  Then he said to me, \"Keep quiet.  Don't tell me that I've handcuffed you okay.\"  And Roland said to me, \"Let's go to the car.\"  Then we entered into the car.  It took us to town.  It took us to Adame House.  When we entered there that is where my sister and my son were there.  Then we passed them.  We went to a certain room.  (Inaudible) ... Roland said to Robert and Walter, \"You must be busy with him.  You must hit him.  You must beat him.\"  Then this Mowale said, \"Do you remember, that is the person you said one day we will meet at the crossroads. This is the person.\"  And Roland said, \"Is this the person?\"  Then Roland closed the door and locked.  I was handcuffed and it was stiff right on my hands.  Then the other one pulled me on the left hand and the other one on the left hand.  I was  beaten.  I was assaulted and I ended up giving up.  They were all assaulting me and every time I fell they would kick me and they lifted me up and they would start afresh with their assault.  At one stage I couldn't bear the pain any more and I pulled myself out of their hands and I picked up the typewriter.  I wanted to throw it through the window to break the cars downstairs but they managed to grab it and Roland opened the door.  He said, \"What's happening?\"  They said to him, \"He wants to throw the typewriter outside.  Luckily we got hold of it.\"  And he said to them, \"Continue beating him up.\"  I was severely beaten up and thereafter they put a mask on my head and they took me to a car.  Roland and Prins were at the front seat.  I was at the back seat with Tabanelo and Mowale putting me in the middle.  We drove off until in the township, through the township and we went to a very farest corner where you would shout and nobody would hear you and it was the road leading to the old cemetery in Kroonstad.  As I was just concentrating, I could feel the car was now on a steep and I said, \"This is the road leading to the cemetery.\"  As they were driving they drove around until they stopped.  My hands were still handcuffed and I was told to get off the car and they said to me, \"Sit down.\"  I sat down.  They said, \"On your knees.\"  Then they took my hands as they were handcuffs and I was made to sit on my haunches and as I was sitting they fastened me with ropes and I was electrocuted.  I could only feel this shock getting into my body.  I couldn't understand what was happening.  They said to me, \"We aren't going to leave you before you tell us the truth.  Where is your firearm?\"  I said,  /\"Guys,",

            "\"Guys, which firearm are you referring to?\"  They said, \"We want a firearm.  Before you give us that firearm we aren't just going to leave you.\"  They were torturing me in that way and I was crying like a baby.  I was crying like a baby.  This electrocution was very bad.  After some few minutes they took me to Bren Park.  I was dizzy.  I couldn't understand what was happening.  I couldn't even think properly.  They went to Mofube's house.  They searched.  I was assaulted.  My youngest daughter was staying at Mofube's house and she was surprised as to what was happening.  She was asking herself, \"What are they doing to my father?  Why are they beating him so much?\"  It was late at about 5 o'clock and I was taken to Seisoville police station and I was kept in the cell.  I spent the night at the police station but I could feel my head was getting heavy and I felt it with my hands.  It was swollen.  My eyes were closed because my face was swollen.  Blood was coming from the ears and from the nose and every time I couldn't breathe properly.  I took out my handkerchief at night.  I wanted to sneeze.  I think I sneezed a lot but my eye protruded.  I stopped it and I pushed it backwards and I didn't know the reason why was my eye protruding.  The next day my wife and my daughter-in-law came to see me.  When the policeman opened the door for them I couldn't see them but I could hear from their voices that this was my wife.  And the policeman opened the door and my wife said to the policeman, \"No, this is not the man we're looking for.  We aren't looking for this man.\"  And I said, \"Grace, I'm your husband.  There is no one else.  They kept me in the cell for a long  time and when my brother(?) was supposed to appear before the court of law, I was there among this group.  When we came before the magistrate he said, \"Accused No 4, the case is closed.  You can go home.  You're discharged.\"  And I went out of the box.  There was this other chap, a white chap who was a special branch member and I said to him, \"I know the case has been dropped but the injuries that I sustained and the torture that you gave me, should I just stop here?\"  And I said to him, \"I think I should take further steps even though I don't have money.\"  I remember Mr Lefafa, he was telling me, he said, \"Leepo, I want you to take further steps.\"  But this special branch member said to me, \"Listen here, you know what, if I were you I would never take any steps against the police because if you do that they are going to trace you and I must tell you if you can just lay charges against them you must know that you are going to end up nowhere and your children will never know where their father it.\"  And this was very uncomfortable.  I was told by a special branch member that my children will lose me forever.  I decided, no, I should leave this matter.  Since then my life was a misery.  Until today I'm not - I was working but I lost my job and until today I am a sickly person.  I can hardly work.  I can't do anything.  I can't even lift up my grandchild.  I can't cuddle her in my hands.  I just pick her up for a minute and I'm tired thereafter.  Even if when I walk, I'm battling.  Since then my life changed.  The torture, my private parts were also damaged and this really affected my relationship with my wife.  And until today I'm not working.  I cannot work.   /I cannot",

            "Ndade Moleke I want again to reiterate what has been said by my colleagues here.  In fact the great victims are those who tortured you because they lost all  /their\ntheir humanity, humanness, ubuntu.  It is only the beasts or wild animals, which don't have the image of God, could treat a person like that.  That is why Mr Mdu Dlamini said that we would like to get in touch with Mowale and Tabanelo because, if the Act has to do the healing of the nation, they need to be healed too.  They need to come forward and say why they treated you in this bestial manner so that they can also be helped as the victims as perpetrators.  And of course, if they don't come, as Brother Dlamini said, we will have to subpoena them to come forward.  They are going to know about this because the media is here.  They will be hearing their names.  Maybe it would be better for them to come even forward before the are subpoenaed.  We thank you for your courage and it is just God's miracle that you still have the memory of saying what you say after having been tortured in such a manner.  Please convey our greetings to your wife.  We are sorry that this thing has also affected your marriage life as you have just said.  You were so tortured that your marriage life has also been affected by this kind of a torture.  Thank you for coming, showing the courage.  May God bless you.  Thank you.\n/CHAIRMAN",

We were still there.  We had our arms.  We were not fighting with the police.  We were trying to protect our area.  We were searching each and every car which entered the village.  Whether we know the car or we don't know the car, we would search peacefully and ask their names, identify them peacefully and leave them to enter.  Then the police came.  Those policemen were all white.  They came nearer to us and then they were driving us - they were forcing us to lead to the way to town.  Then the station commander came first, Mr van Rooyen - I know him well, I can identify him, Mr van Rooyen.  Then they opened their vans.  He made ready his gun.  I didn't understand as to whether when they were pulling their guns what they were going  to do, so he started to shoot.  Then all of them started shooting.  The people who were shot on that day were 20.  Only one person died.  Others were arrested, others were assaulted.  I was shot and then I ran.  I was shot on the left hand and again on the thigh.  Then they tried to catch me but they were not able to do so.  Then from there I took the road to town and from there I was able to hide myself.  There is a place called Sterling.

It is such a pity that young people of your age had to suffer in such a way that they would find it very hard to continue their plans in life.  And what is more happening is to find that most of the perpetrators are having jokes, enjoying themselves, supporting their families and others are holding positions in the government.  This is really a concern that people who caused so much havoc in the old dispensation, tortured people, people became handicapped, they themselves are having a high profile in our government.  As the fellow colleague has said, we have noted your requests and they will be forwarded to the President and the government.  I'm very much interested about your willing to go back to school because we need to empower ourselves now with skills, even if you go to work, you get a job, you have no skills and I think people who don't have skills are going to have it hard in this new South Africa because what is going to be used is the skills.

She stays with my grandmother but my grandmother has since been deceased.  She died when I was still in prison.  I grew up in Theunissen and I schooled in Theunissen.  I left school what I was in Standard 5 because of certain problem in the household.  It's then that I decided that I should help my mother by working and I stayed with my mother and I could help my mother.  I was holding piece jobs from time to time so as to be able to make ends meet because we had financial problems and I could not go back to school.  I decided that I should go and train myself for skills.  Then I took up courses as an electrician.  I worked at the mines.  Then after that I met and worked with a certain contract because I  couldn't get a job as an electrician.  Thereafter, after about nine months I decided to go to Johannesburg but I was unable because my mother was all by herself at home and I was the one taking care of her and I decided that I should get a job closer to my place.  Then I got a job as an electrician at a certain mine and I was earning R175,00 per week.  I worked up to such time that I got injured.  I was involved in this type of accident.  We heard that there was some riot within the Masilo place.  We were told that a certain Banaso and other people were going to come and attack.  There's a certain gentleman by the name of Dinana who was a student and Quinana was involved in attacking the Comrades together with the police.  He belonged to many organisations.  That is he also had a football club as well as people who were playing guitars.  I don't know what resolution they reached but Quinana had to be forgiven and our community decided that Quinana could not be forgiven because many of the Comrades were now in prison because of Quinana's actions.  And he is the one who had brought the police to come and arrest members of the community.  And we knew Quinana very well because he was a resident and he did not want to listen to us.  We reached a decision as to what we should do with Quinana and a meeting was convened so that we could discuss what had to be done with Quinana.

            "  Thereafter it so happened that on a particular night at about past ten we heard some noise outside the building and it sounded like there was an attack and we were told that the anti-Comrade gang was present and it was already attacking the Comrades and we had to go and protect our community.  We decided to form ourselves into groups and we surrounded the neighbourhood.  We went to the outskirts of the place and we were stopping cars and searching the cars before they got into the residential area.  We were telling ourselves that we were protecting our own community from the imminent attack of the anti-Comrades.  We felt that we had to protect the older residents as the youth.  Then we reached a resolution that we should got to the outskirts of town and keep a vigil there because we had heard that we were going to be attacked.  After about a few minutes, whilst we were there, we saw a police Casspir.  It parked there.  We were about 200.  They just stopped there and looked at us.  Thereafter it happened that this Casspir went away and it came back with a convoy of about seven cars, very big cars.  There were about three four-by-fours, two private cars and the police cars.  They came quite slowly.  They were driving slowly towards us.  We didn't pay much attention to them because we were not fighting with them.  We were not able to run because they came and they shone their headlights on us whilst we were sitting down.  They got  out of their cars.  We saw farmers as well and the farmers were also armed.  They surrounded us.  They formed a circle around us and they told us to stand up.  Then we decided that we should stand up and some of us were scared because we did not know what they were going to do to us.  Then we formed a circle.  Some of them were now getting scared and they were trying to run and everybody else now started to run and there was no way that I could run.  I was not able to run away from the commotion.  Then I decided that I should surrender.  Some had already been shot and there were headlights shining upon those people.  It was as if it was broad daylight and I lifted my hands up as a sign of surrender and I stood for about 15 minutes with my hands up and a white man in army uniform shot me.  And he was actually cocking his gun, then I decided to run.  I ran only a few paces with bullets whizzing past my head.  Then I felt a shot on my left hand.  That is on my arm and I could feel that my arm was painful.  I tried to stretch my arm.  Then I realised that my arm had been broken.  And as I was trying to stand up I was unable and my arm was giving me a problem.  I just couldn't stretch it and I remained in that position for quite some time and bullets were whizzing past at that time and some people were running away from the scene.  Others were lying flat on the ground.  And ultimately another white person came to me.  He said to me I must stand up.  I told him that I wasn't able to stand up because of my arm that was painful and broken and he realised that there was something that had happened to my arm.  My arm was injured.  Then he lifted me up and he took me back to  the other white people and he left me and I was pushed with the back of the gun into the Casspir.  I got in without any protest because I realised that I needed help.  I got into the police Casspir.  When we got inside some were shot in the mouth, some were shot on the legs, they were shot at different parts of the body and people were screaming inside.  I tried to get a place to relax to try and be in a sleeping position because I could not stand on my feet and there was a black policeman who said I should balance on the table.  That's when I balanced on the table.  I just had something hitting me from the back and when I looked it was the butt of a gun.  And thereafter I lost consciousness because I fell down and I was left to lie on the floor.  At about 1 o'clock in the morning we were taken to the provincial hospital.  I was put into plaster of Paris and we were under police guard at the time when we were in the hospital.  We were under police guard.  Six policemen were actually guarding us and people from our places and homes could not come to see us because we were under police guard.  I was not able to go home and when I went back home I went to the Comrades to ask for some help and I asked them to give me some money to go to Lesotho because they were going to arrest me in this place so I had to go to Dr Zwane, who's a private doctor.  He took out the plaster of Paris and attend to my arm.  I explained to him that I was from the provincial hospital.   Then I was taken to Pilinomi and they asked me as to what I wanted to do.  I had to undergo an operation on my arm.  After the operation some iron rods were put inside my arm.   Policemen came at that particular hospital and they were looking for me and the nurses did not want to show them where I was but they told me that the police were actually looking for me.  Then they wanted to see my arm but I refused because my arm was in bandages and I had undergone an operation and they said I wasn't the one that they were looking for.  The following morning I decided to run away from the hospital and I went to Lesotho and I disappeared at that time.",

I was selling dagga at that time so that I could make some money to maintain my family.  So I was not able to work because the police kept on arresting me and I would go to prison and come back once more.  Then I decided that I had to make a living out of selling dagga.  So I decided that that's the only way I could make a living.  I've just come back from prison.  I came back in June from prison and my mother who was helping me - my grandmother was helping me whilst I was in prison has now since been deceased.  So I'm not able to make ends meet at the present moment.  Even the letters and the documents that I've sent haven't served any purpose.",

I don't think that was your own fault.  I think it was because of the circumstances which prevailed in the country.  You wanted to get the ways of supporting your family.  We think that you were trying to be very responsible but of course used methods which are not acceptable.  We can see very well here that if there were some people who were colluding with the system, some of them were doctors.  I don't think that the oath which is taken by doctors called the Hippocratic Oath which they take when they become doctors that they would serve anybody does really allow a person like Dr Storm to refuse a person and say that a person must be put in a storeroom.  I think in that he broke the very oath that he took when be became a doctor and those actions need to be revisited.  Maybe he himself has to come forward and tell us why he broke his oath as a doctor and not treat a human being when he was in need.  What also impresses  me in this statement which is before me which is that one of Eric is that in spite of all what he has suffered he still thinks about the community.  I just want to cite some of the things he says here.  He says that as a reparation they would ask for the proper roads leading to the community township and also maybe monuments for those who died.  That's in itself reveals that you are very community orientated and of course you suffered because you wanted to defend your community.

They said he alleged that he had los some money on that day and when he saw the police he asked them to search a person who was following him at that time.  And the police said he was drunk and they did not want to listen to him.  And they had an argument.  They were alleging that he was drunk and he was denying it.  And one of the policemen hit him with the fist on his chest.  Then he returned to fist to the police.  That's when the fight started.  The fight between the police and my deceased brother started then.  And that's when he was arrested.  He was taken to the police station.  The explanation that we got from the security was that my brother had assaulted a policeman, that's why he was arrested and he had to be taken to the police station.  We proceeded to the police station looking for him.  They denied his presence.  They said they had not yet arrested anyone of that description.  We decided that time was moving on and at about 3 o'clock a certain black surgeon, Mr Nbongo, arrived at the police station and he told us that he had seen a person of that description.  He had been arrested at that particular police station and he said that we should come later on when the station commander was present.  When we came back on that particular day the  station commander told us that he did not have time for us because we were very stubborn.  We were just like my brother who had been arrested at that time.  And he told me that my brother was present but we could not see him.  At that time we didn't know whether he was still alive or he was already dead.  It was late and we had to go home and sleep and come back.  We went back the following day on the 26th.  Then we were told that he had committed suicide.  He had hanged - killed himself.  We wanted to know the details surrounding his death but nobody could come forth with any information.  We were not told as to how he died.  They said they were arrested and were put in a certain cell together with eight other prisoners.  And one female said he was alone in the cell.  He was not with other detainees or prisoners.  When we enquired as to why he was arrested, they said he had sworn at the officers.

            "  When I began to realise that Sipho was a political activist it was then that many policemen and the Mogoregi who was named \"Fly\" in Tabong who was a special branch member together with a white man called Venter, together with Piet, they were coming to visit him many times look for him then I kepT on asking, \"Why do you look for him?\"  They say, \"We're going to discuss with him and then we'll bring him home.\"  They would take him and when he  came back he would lose appetite, he would not be able to drink water or even milk.  He would say he cannot even swallow.  Then he would be silent until I kept on asking that, \"Exactly what's happening?\", then he said, \"There's nothing.  I don't know why these people are coming to be many times.\"  Then they said, \"There's nothing wrong which he did.  We're just asking him questions.\"  That is the life he was living week in, week out until the time I made him to flee because I realised that I'm going to lose him.  Then he went away and then came back.  Then he joined by Silo Ditebe where they were able to hide themselves.  Then the other group called Matsibi Sokolode and Hothuli whom they came to look for him.  Then I told him that he went to Wesselsbron.  Because he's a person who's an artist he's at Wesselsbron.  He has been asked by shop owners to come and decorate at their shops.  You'd find him on the windows in one of the shops in town.  I was creating an opportunity so that I'll be able to go and notify them to hide themselves.  I told those people that he went to Wesselsbron.  They kept on coming looking for him.  At times they would find him.  When Matsibi Sokolode and Hothuli said to me I should reprimand him.  If I don't reprimand him, I'll wake up when he's far away where I cannot find him again.  So I tried to reprimand him.  Then one day he came to sleep at home.  As I was staying with a friend.  Then I whispered to tell him about the whole situation.  That person is Jacob Thabosi Tsake.  Then I said to him the Hothuli company said they're going to come back.  Then if they're going to get him, I should know that it's going to be win or lose  situation.  Then I said I'm going to use your wardrobe to hide him.  Then this man kept quiet.  He didn't say yes or no.  I said, because I've no chance.  I don't know where I should take him to.  They would look for him wherever he was.  Then I said at the time when they arrived, I'll go to the small bedroom then I would wake him up first before I opened the door.  I was not successful in that attempt.  I ... (inaudible) ... him alone.  His sister's children were there and my two daughters were there.  I was still pregnant with Albertina.  They didn't know my attempt, it was only Jacob who knew.  I was surprised when I was trying to walk slowly to the bedroom to find that this door which I thought I would keep on opening it so that it cannot make any noise to give them a sign that I'm trying to make an attempt to make him flee, I found that it was closed.  I tried to open it but it made a noise.  When I opened the bedroom, I found that the window - it was the window which didn't have curtains, but the curtains were removed and hanged on top.  The window acted as if it is a window without curtains.  When I tried to wake him up, one policeman said, \"We are already here.  Don't try to hide him.  We knew that he's here.  We saw him even before you tried to make him escape.\"  I didn't have any alternative I had to wake him up so that they should not see him first because they would wake him roughly then they would start kicking and clapping.  I used to wake him up first before I opened the door.  Then I said, \"Wake up.  Those people are here.  There's no change they have seen you.\"  Then I asked them that who has pulled over the curtains.  Then I didn't get an  answer.  Even today I didn't get an answer.  Even if when the doors were closed but at that day the curtains were rolled up and his bed was just next to the window.  Then I could see that the person who was rolling up the curtains was making it possible for the police to see him clearly.  It went on.  The took him and brought him back.  I gave him R4,00 to leave and go to a place where he can hide because now I can see that there is an enemy in the house whom we are living with.  This enemy whom I don't know.  So please if you can go to a certain place.  Then he went.  It was on a Thursday when I saw him for the last time.  It was then that on Saturday that I learnt that he was arrested.  Then the person called Sichaba came to inform me, who is staying at Odendaalsrus, to bring be an information that Sipho has been arrested.  But he looked upset.  Then I said as they used to take him and bring him back, maybe he will come back.  On Saturday I didn't see him.  On Sunday I went to the charge office to try to find out what is he charged for.  Then they old me that the police called Pele welcomed me.  Then he said there is no help, as he was hit by the car by a minister of the Lutheran Church.  Even this case of being hit by a car, we have cancelled it.  We're not going to continue that because now he is interfering with the government therefore we have no time for the case.  I asked why he was arrested.  They told me that he's sticking his fingers right into the business of the government.  Then I asked, \"Can I give him these new clothes?\"  They I said, \"I want to see him.\"  Then I asked them as to whether is he well.  Then they said, \"How are you talking?\"  Then I said, \"I want  to know as to whether he's still healthy.\"  He doesn't have scratches because I told you that you always come at home then I'm asking that, \"Yes, you always take him.  You must bring him healthy without any scratches, without any scar.\"  They told me that he has no scars, he has no wounds.  That is then that David Tsijake who is the son to Jacob Tsijake, they told him that Hothuli took him.  He was taken to the charge office.  Then he found Sipho lying down on the floor and the blood was on the floor mixed with water showing that he was poured with water.  His hands were tied at the back.  Then wen Hothuli entered, he said when he asked Sithole as to whether, \"Has this dog made himself dead.\"  That's when Sithole answered Hothuli.  He said, \"I said he should come with a stretcher and out this dog to the mortuary.  When he has last seen his grandfather he will wake up.\"  This Sithole who has already died now, he was an adjutant at that time.",

            "  (PATRICK MACHEDE)  Comrade Silo has mentioned a few points.  Now, the problem is that we were put in different cells.  Comrade Silo was in cell No 3.  I was in cell No 7.  We were in different cells, as I've mentioned.  Now, on this day the 4th of May, it was just after breakfast, I saw Comrade Sipho passing by the door.  It was this steel door.  The door was still open but the burglar door was closed.  Comrade Sipho passed and he greeted me.  We used to call each other by names.  He used to say I'm Malapropism and I used to call him Mr No Problem.  As I was standing at the door because we'd been in the cells for quite some time, he passed and he greet me by the name I've just mentioned and I greeted him back.  And I could see he was handcuffed at the back and he was wearing a jean.  And they passed with him, they headed for the charge office, and they came back going to the CIDs offices.  These were opposite my cell.  They got him into the office and I heard him screaming and I wanted to peep through the door and I saw there was a Mr Sithole, who as since died, and I Mr Moia and Joachim Mashade and Mr Squash Magoe and the other one who was called Ramongalo.  They were busy.  It seemed as if they were assaulting him.  After some few minutes as I was trying to investigate this matter Adjutant Sithole passed and he realised that the door was open and he pushed the door heavily and he  was asking why did they open this door.  I wanted to push the door so that he doesn't close it and that's where there was a conflict of words between Noha and Sithole.  Noha was responsible for the cells.  He was the person closing the doors and opening the doors every time we had to go and have our meals.  The ordered him to close the door and he did just that.  After a few minutes I could hear the door was opened and a certain Ramongalo came to fetch me.  As I was following him he said to me, \"You are a bandit and a bandit would never at any stage follow the officer.  The officer has to follow the bandit.\"  He said, \"Come and have a look at one of your friends.  He has urinated on himself.  He has shit on himself and this is the situation that you are going to confront.\"  And as I was entering this door Silo was on the other side and I was on the other side.  Has face was swollen and I tried to greet him but I could realise that he was a bit confused.  I tried to speak to him but he just ignored me.  And they put us into the cell and Comrade Sipho was lying with his hands handcuffed at the back.  The floor was full of blood and water.  And they pointed at him and they said, \"This is your friend.  Wake him up.\"  Now, this Moia kicked him and he dropped him on the waist and he said, \"Wake up.  Have a look at your Comrades.\"  Comrade Sipho lifted his head.  He wanted to say something but he couldn't.  He fell.  And Comrade Silo couldn't hold himself and I comforted him and we went back to our cell.  It was clear that Silo was not aware of what was happening at that time.  I left with him to take him to his cell and we stopped at his cell door and he was taken back to  Comrade Silo's cell and I was taken to my cell.  But I went to cell 6 where I met other Comrades until the 5th where the attorney Richard Spoor came to see us to tell us that Comrade Sipho has passed away.",

I think the investigating unit is going to have an interesting case here.  Where we have got the eyewitnesses who themselves, by the way, are the victims, I think it will be interesting to see those people when they come forward to tell the story why they killed Sipho that they'll be confronted by you as also the victims and they'll have to tell the story too why they tortured you.  One of the interesting things about this case is that many people sold out during these happenings.  We have the teachers here who allowed themselves to tell lies and say that this young man was epileptic because they were asked to do so.  To me that is very serious.  And again you were confused by the lawyer from the organisation who refused the mother the  access to the inquest room and that is also going to be very interesting.  And Mr Mdu Dlamini has already said that it's the organisation which is going to help us with this why was she denied the access to the inquest room.  And again it's interesting that many names keep on coming which came yesterday, the Hugos and others.  Anyway, just as I've said already that we thank you two young men for the courage.  You have shown that you were really friends of Sipho because people tend out of sight, out of mind, but you people, in spite of all that has happened, were prepared to come forward and support Sipho's mother when she tells the story about the death of her son and also about your torture and you must be full of courage indeed.  That is why I say that you deserve to be a mayor of Odendaalsrus.  You have passed the passage - you have gone the passage of suffering and by God's miracles you're on top now.  You see, from the bottom to the top and when these people are facing you now, they'll be facing not just ordinary Silo, they'll be facing a mayor of the town.  And, Mama, Sipho's mother, you are indeed a very bold, courageous woman.  When you said that you have got courage, you wanted to come in and see, you're not just telling stories.  You are indeed very bold and very courageous and very strong.  And may the Lord help you.  We have noted all that has happened here and where there are requests made by you we shall channel them to the right places through the government.

            "  Patrick Mwilwa.  When I was coming from the launch I left my son together with other Comrades and as I proceeded towards the shop, that is Mr Mwilwa's shop, I saw two Kombis, Mwilwa's Kombis, and they were full of people inside but I never paid much attention as to what sort of people they were.  And there is another person by the name of Banadidi Bukha who said he was looking for Habanyani.  And I didn't know as to what he was looking for Habanyani for.  At about 10.00 in the evening I went home and I switched on lights.  I heard some gunshots outside and I went back to the launch to investigate as to what was happening.  And I was these cars moving from Mwilwa's shop and they were proceeding out upwards the street and the doors of the cars were not closed.  And I waited to see as to what was going on but I couldn't make head nor tail of what was taking place.  And the Comrades dissuaded me from going out to investigate as to what was happening because people were being assaulted outside.  And I went away.  I went to sleep.  Then the following morning my wife's sister came to ask me as to where my son was.  I told her that didn't know where he was and she asked me as to whether I had observed or heard anything about the gunshots that were fired the previous day and she said we should go and  look for my son.  We went away to look for my son because we had sent him away.  We went away looking for him and we came across other Comrades and we asked them as to where Walter was and we were told that he was together with other Comrades.  We went back to my place.  I few moments after I got to my place I heard some noise outside.  I think it was about past eight in the morning and I went outside to investigate what was happening.  I came across the anti-Comrade gang who were having shovels as well as pangas and I was running towards Mwilwa's shop.  And when I got to Mwilwa's shop I saw this group of Comrades in front of the shop and they were stoning Mwilwa's shop.  And Mwilwa went away.  Then there's a certain person Banasi's husband, John Dibuka, he was having a firearm as well as a panga in his hand and the other ones were having shovels and they were coming towards us.  We saw some pick-ups and they went past these people who were armed and at that time the Comrades had already left the scene.  When we got to the Methodist Church we saw the police and they were chasing the Comrades.  We saw a Cressida from Bloemfontein and we asked ourselves as to why they were stopping because they could see that there was commotion.  At the time, the Comrades got some petrol out of this Cressida.  They went to burn Banasi's shop and thereafter they dispersed.  I stood at the corner of the church and I could hear some gunshots.  As was still listening to that, I decided that I should go because I was in danger.  As we were still there, I saw two policemen.  They were a little bit further down, maybe half a kilometre from where we were standing and we heard some  gunshots.  Thereafter I went home and when I got home I got a message that my son had been shot.  I went out and tried to investigate as to where he was.  I was told that he had gone to a doctor's surgery and when I got to the doctor's surgery I was told that he had been chopped with these shovels as well as pangas and the doctor could not help him.  He was taken into an ambulance.  I got into the ambulance and the ambulance proceeded to the charge office and it waited there for plus/minus 30 minutes and I asked them as to why they were wasting so much time because my child was injured and he needed medical attention but they never answered me.  They were busy talking to the policemen.  And this ambulance took rounds in the town.  It never went straight to the hospital.  And it was being driven at quite a very low speed.  They were not really concerned about my son's injuries.  We got to the provincial hospital and he was taken into the hospital.  They remained there for quite a few minutes then they came back and they said they could not admit him and we had to take him to Pilinomi Hospital in Bloemfontein.  We proceeded to Pilinomi with him and when we got to Pilinomi we were told that they could not help him so he had to be taken back to provincial hospital in Welkom and we came back with him once more.  We stayed for quite some time at provincial hospital until he died without him being attended to.  Thereafter, after about some time when he was already buried I received a letter from the magistrate who was telling me that he wanted me to come to his offices and see him.  When I got to the magistrate he took out certain statements and read them out to me and he asked  me as to whether I understood.  I said, yes, I did understand, and he said the police said they could not get whoever shot my son.  And I asked the magistrate as to why he had called me because this matter was supposed to be dealt with in court and we were discussing it in the office and I did not understand if that was really procedural.  Because the police had shot my son, that's why they said there could not be any case.  That was the end of the whole matter.",

Your case too will be investigated and we need to investigate to know who this magistrate is who deviated from the process who prevented the court sitting by just telling you that the police say that they don't find the murderer of your son.  That process was wrong as you rightly said so - that that thing had to go into the courts of law and that thing never happened and of course we have eyewitnesses who are here who may be called one day to give us some of the things we want to be clear about in this case and Dibuka who is in Virginia.  Also if we need him, we'll get hold of him.  Of course Patrick unfortunately ... (Tape ends.  Subsequent tape commences without overlap) ...

            "  It was in 1993 but I don't quite remember the month or the date but it was on a Saturday, Saturday evening.  It was at about 7.00 in the evening.  I was preparing myself to go to Bloemfontein and I took my car.  I was driving my car together with my friend.  Just before we got to Brandfort, about ten kilometres outside Brandfort, we heard some gunshots and the car that was driving behind us was a microbus and they were shooting at us from the back.  They shot at the back windscreen and they kept on shooting at us up to that time that I lost control of the car and the car went out of the road and it capsized just nearby the road.  I don't know what happened to my friend because each and every one of us was concerned about our own lives.  When I looked at the people who were in the Kombi, they were wearing khaki garments.  They were white people.  And they kept on shooing at us.  They were actually attempting to kill us.  And I heard my friend screaming but I don't know whether he was shot at that time and I started running.  I didn't even know where I was running to but I just wanted to save my live at that time because I realised that we were going to  get killed so we left the car there at that moment.  I kept on running as far as my feet could carry me and I hid myself in a certain pipe that I got.  After about quite some time, when I realised that I was out of danger, I came out of the pipe and asked a certain person to help me.  I was taken by the police to the Brandfort Police Station.  They attempted to phone certain police for back-up as well as the station commander but no police came to give me any assistance as well as the station commander was nowhere to be found.  And it was black policemen who were at work on duty at that day and they were also scared to go to the scene of the crime.  They said it was a usual occurrence that black people would be shot at and they said I should remain at the charge office and we would go to that scene the following morning.  We went there the following morning to check as to what had happened.  Whatever was in the car had been smashed.  The lights were smashed, the windscreen was smashed and the car looked as if they had climbed on top of the roof and hopped or jumped on top of it and they discovered two bullet cartridges and the holes that were in the car were innumerable.   We went back to the police station, that is the Brandfort Police Station, and when we got there I made a statement and I was also told that these  bullet cartridges would be taken for forensic examination or for ballistic tests.  They phoned my parents.  When my parents came to fetch me they also took me to a certain doctor and at the time I didn't know where my friend was.  I had absolutely no idea as to what had happened to him and at the time the police  were still investigating as to his whereabouts.  He was discovered in the mealie fields later on and he was badly injured.  I was taken to a doctor's surgery.  They took me to Dr Storm and they sutured me.  I was also put in a plaster of Paris and I was awaiting that I was going to be called for the case or to be told as to what happened to the bullet cartridges and what were the results.  I never got the results thereof but what I got were insults which I got from a certain person that I suspect was also a boer.  The station commander told me that, \"You kaffir, what do you want?  Do you want to die?\"  I replied him and I told him that if it was my time to die I was prepared to die but that was the same thing that was going to happen to him.  That's how we had an altercation because I felt very heartsore.  And the case was never dealt with.  Nothing was done.  No investigations were made and I was never notified of anything.  I just saw this in the newspaper.  That is all that happened in that case.",

I want to repeat that, you need the treatment just as your perpetrators.  I think the whole thing of the Truth Commission is that  the victim must be helped and then the perpetrator must be helped.  That's what I just want to say.  You need to tell yourself you also need a treatment just as you have rightly said that the perpetrators need the treatment because they need to be healed and retain that ubuntu which God had given them.  And also I hope by your telling this story it may start a healing process in you because the whole aim of the Truth Commission is that of healing.  I know that you are severely wounded physically and emotionally and otherwise.  That's why you are speaking about that and I hope that your telling the story has started a process of healing in you because these things were locked in your chest and you never had an opportunity of telling this story about them.  I hope since you started telling the story even this hate for the white people may be changed.  I think you hated the white people because of the context of which you found yourselves, how they treated you.  If you go to other areas you find that they hate the blacks who treated them badly.  I think they are related to own context.  It must be clear that even if these people were blacks you would still stay I hate these black people because of the treatment they gave me.  But I want to say that by telling this story we shall try by all means to recommend what we have said here to the government and also you need to get counselling because we were created as human beings not to hate by to love.  Once you start hating, it means that there's something wrong with you and we hope that the counselling which you may get, as my colleague Mrs Gcabashe has been saying that you need to get the counselling to help you  so that this kind of hurt and hate may be changed in something which is very positive so that the Truth Commission may fulfil its aim for what it was made to do.  Then we thank you very much for coming here to tell your very sad story and I would encourage you to encourage your Senama home to come forward and see the statement takers so that he can also have an opportunity to tell his story because that is the whole aim.  You've just mentioned him but he has not had a chance of himself coming forward to tell his own story, to pour out his own pain.

There are people here who failed to do their duties like Constable Kabayi who refused to take the statement.  He showed some prejudice and I don't believe that a policeman, who has to save the community, must act that way.  And of course there is Theunissen station commander Van Rooyen who was threatening to arrest you.  Those things will be followed up to see why those things did happen.  And as the fellow colleague has just said that we have noted your concerns and requests, we shall pass them - we have no power to give anything but we'll pass the recommendation to the government.  Although you say that the doctors have not helped you but I think you are very disturbed emotionally.  You'd need a kind of counselling by a psychologist.

And she said to me, \"I do not know, \" and there after I left her.  My grandmother and other  women came home and as they were chatting they said, \"That woman that your daughter visited was so scared to come to you to tell you that your grandson has died.\"  And I was crying then after receiving the news and the preparations were made for me to come to Welkom to report this matter.  But Andeli Lobese's family received a telephone call and one of the children came home and said Andile wants to speak to you and I gave them my telephone numbers and Andile gave me a call and he said to me, \"Know that your brother has died.\"  I said to him, \"What is the cause of the death?\"  And he said, \"No, I won't tell you but I will tell you some other day when I'm available.\"  And I had to come to Welkom to report the matter.  I didn't tell my mother straight that my brother was killed.  I went to a relative of ours called Denja and Denja said we should go to Matsipe who was a lawyer at Odendaalsrus and I went to this attorney.  I explained to him everything.  I said, \"I am scared of telling my mum this bad news.  I don't want to break this news to her.  Will you please go and tell her?\"  Really the next day Mr Matsipe came home and he broke the news and he said to her, \"Your daughter came to me to seek my assistance.  I'm here to tell you that your son has died.\"  And we then told my father.  He was working in the industrial area.  And we went back to Matsipe to enquire as to the cause of his death but Mr Matsipe said he didn't get enough information.  It would be much better if we go to those countries and get a full picture of what happened.  And I said, \"Mr Matsipe, how would I go to those countries because we don't have funds and we've heard that it's so  expensive and how would we get there?\"  He said, \"I do not know really.\"  I said to him, \"Don't you think it would be a wise thing to contact the people of the ANC?\" and he said, \"No, we can't do it now.\"  And I went back home.  I was together - oh, we had our brother Peter Mohati who was staying in Gauteng and I gave him a call and he said to me, \"Please come down.\"  My mother tried to get money.  She was doing temporary jobs at OK and I went to Johannesburg.  It was on a Saturday.  On Monday we went to the ANC offices.  When we arrived at the offices we were sitting there.  Nobody attended to us.  And we went back home.  The next day on Tuesday we went back and we were told that Chris Hani was not available.  He was outside the country and I requested them to give us anybody who would assist us and they gave us someone to assist us but unfortunately I can't remember his name and I enquired from this man about Kenneth and his whereabouts and where he died.  This man opened some files and he checked from 1976 until 1990 and he discovered that his name didn't appear in all the books and he said to me, \"Please come the next day because I will check in the next file that is coming in from Angola.  There are people who died in Angola.\"  And on Friday I went back and he told me that our brother died - I can't remember was it in Tanzania or in Angola.  Yes, it was in Tanzania.  When I wanted him to tell me the reason for his death he said, no, he didn't have any reason.  I was doing my part-time jobs at OK and I received a telephone call as I was working.  It was on a Saturday.  And I was told to rush to Johannesburg.  I went to Johannesburg and I met Peter.  He took me to a  certain gentleman who was a Comrade.  You know, I don't know Gauteng as a whole but he was somewhere in Gauteng.

He failed his Standard 9 and my mother decided he should go to Dosa College and he passed his N4 and he wanted to go back to school because of unemployment but my mother didn't have money and he went to Theba until he was employed.  Now, the girl was at Lepula School last year and she didn't succeed with her matric.  Now she is attending the college to improve her two subject mathematics and physical science.  She is still the burden of my mother.  The father is not working.  This really affected the family but most of all it affected my mother because if she had money, she goes to the specialist and if she doesn't, she goes to the hospital and she pays R13,00 every time she consults the hospital.  And she told me that the amount has increased with R2,00.  It's now R15,00.  We've encouraged her to go to a private doctor because the tablets that they give her are not helping.  At all times she has got this high blood pressure.  It's always high.  And at one stage the doctor indicated that she's got a TB touch.  And she went to the clinic for further medication.  She took that medication and after a few months she stopped taking those tablets.  I'm staying at my house.  One day I saw her coming to my place and she told me that blood was coming out of the mouth and she was taken to the hospital said they  couldn't see anything wrong with her.",

            "Thank you.  I just wanted to check about that.  Mama, you are one of the women who have really suffered.  In the first place you grew up in hell.  The home is where people should be happy so that when you are at work somewhere, if you find some problem you say that, \"Oh, I wish the time for going home was around so that I can go back and be happy at home with my family.\"  But it would appear that your house a ... (inaudible) ... of fear and torture where you as your whole family were tortured and I guess that affected even your children psychologically.  Children who grew up in homes where there are fights, they are affected psychologically when they grew up.  And so you underwent that type of a torture bringing up your children when the father was there and later you had to be confronted with this type of experience of losing your son and you don't even know where he is buried.  That also is a torture for the parent not to know where his or her child is buried.  We are bearing this pain with you, Mama.  In fact we think you are very strong that you could even come here and testify and tell your story because you have gone through hell.  We have noted your request that you want  your son's bones to be returned from Tanzania so that he could be buried in Tabong at home.  We have noted your request that you would like that the truth should be told about how your son died.  We shall try and liaise with the ANC offices and find out if they cannot help us about all the facts surrounding your son's death.  Where, how he died, which is true in these three versions which are given?  That he committed suicide. If he committed suicide, why he committed suicide?  What are the reasons for his committing of the suicide?  Or this one fighting for a girl.  If he was fighting for a girl, with whom was he fighting and then who's that person who killed him?  And then this other one which says that he was sent to come to South Africa for a mission.  If he was sent, then what happened?  Did he refuse?  And if he refused, what happened then?  What cause his death?  I think it's the ANC which will be able to help up with these questions.  The investigative unit will make these investigations and we'll try and channel your requests especially about this one of reburial.  There are many parents who have children buried somewhere who would like them to be fetched - their bones.  We just hope that where he was buried the place can still be identified so that his bones can be brought back home.  Thank you very much.  And I thank your daughter for being so close to you even though she's married but she can still give you the support.  This is wonderful, young lady.  We commend you for that, starting from the time when you were in PE channelling the messages to our mum and going to Johannesburg to find out about your brother.  That is great.  It means  that you are very much ... (inaudible) ... indeed.  Keep it up.  Thank you very much.  But we must also commend your husband that he can allow you to come to support your mother.  We need to commend him for that - that little act.  It needs to be mentioned.  Thank you very much.  ",

Somebody cannot tell a story for you, you have to tell it yourself so that this pain comes out.  There are many people who have not told their stories.  Can they please be encouraged to come forward to see our statement takers tomorrow to come and tell their stories.  May we now stand for the benediction.  May our God bless our gathering today so that the wishes of His people become true that their story telling and their feeling of their secrets and the opening of their hearts would help them in their lives.  May now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with us till for ever.  Amen.  We remain standing until the witnesses are channelled through.
