            "I will ask you the story shortly for you to tell me the story shortly. ....police raided at least 115 homes and offices across the country ostensibly in search of goods and documents relating to banned organisations, offences under the security laws.  At least seven people, mainly Indians were detained.  Among these was Ahmed Timol a 30 year-old schoolteacher and his brother Mohammed.\n On the 28th of October 1971 it was announced that Ahmed JOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 H TIMOL\nTimol had died the previous day after a fall from the 10th floor window of John Vorster Square.  Brigadier P Kruger and Sergeant Rodrigues both stated that Timol had committed suicide by jumping out of the window.\n I also want to read a little about the investigation and the inquest.  After numerous calls for a full judicial inquiry and inquest into the death of Ahmed Timol began in late April 1972. On the 22nd of June 1972 magistrate Mr J J L De Villiers found that Timol had committed suicide and that there was no one to blame for his death.  The magistrate deduced that as Timol was a self-confessed communist, and I quote,\n\"That he had been familiar with instructions given by the party to its members, these instructions included to commit suicide rather than betray the Communist Party\".\nFurthermore the magistrate believed that Timol had committed suicide because he blamed himself for the information he had revealed to the security police and because he feared long imprisonment.  The magistrate summed up the motives for Ahmed Timol's suicide by stating,\n\"At this stage of his life the opportunity was there and he used it\".\n Auntie Hawa do you remember that I came to your home the other night?",

            "They came first through to see the son and the son was not there.  They said that it was the wrong number.  They asked the neighbours where was Timol and they were told no.2 and they came to us.   They knocked at the door and my late husband asked who is it and they said it was the police and my late husband opened the door.  They came in.  They asked for my late son and we said he wasn't in.  They went to his room and they saw he was not there.  They asked us where he was and they then ransacked all of Ahmed's possessions.  They went on to the balcony and found nothing.\n I then argued with them that I wanted to see my son and they said that your son is with us.  I asked them that I wanted to see him and they said no you cannot see him.  They then sat and they interrogated my late husband and then the Azan(?) that is the call for prayer went and my late husband asked to be allowed to pray.  They refused him to do so.  It was the fasting month and my late husband informed them that he had not missed a prayer for many years and that he be allowed to pray.  He said that he would pray in their presence on the balcony, and that he should be allowed to pray.  They told him that he would jump off the balcony and he then prayed and the police then left.\n There were three policemen and shortly thereafter they came back to look for Haroon and the third time when they came back they took my son Haroon and at quarter past one on Saturday they came back and they again interrogated us.  They wanted to know with whom my son fraternised and who were his friends and where were they.  They continuously interrogated us and they ransacked the home and found nothing.  They then came back at night and again \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 H TIMOL\ninterrogated us.  This happened on Saturday.\n On Sunday nobody came.  On Monday morning the driver, our driver came and they interrogated the driver asking him whether he had a permit.  The driver then indicated to me that he was arrested and I had sent him home in the event of the police coming back.  In the afternoon on the same day they came back and again ransacked the place.  I told them that I wanted to see my son.  \n On Tuesday they came back and I again told them that I wanted to see my son and they told me that you will not see your son again.  I then told the policeman that he should go home and ask his wife what it means to a mother to rear a child and not to see him.  I told him - he asked me numerous questions and left.\n On Wednesday at about 12 they came back again.  They did not come inside the house but they waited outside.  They went on top of the roof.  They interrogated a cleaner.  They asked him who cleans the storeroom.  They asked for the keys of the storeroom.  The landlord had gone to mosque to pray.  They called his wife. The wife opened the storeroom and they asked who cleaned the storeroom and the wife had indicated that it had been cleaned about two weeks ago.  They had interrogated the landlord's wife and they were abusive towards her.  She asked to pray but they did not allow her to pray.\n After the mid-afternoon prayer the landlord came and he was interrogated as well.  They then left and they took the maid and interrogated the maids.  When the maids came back we asked what happened and we were told that they had interrogated them with regards to Ahmed and said that if they don't get the correct answers they would assault them. \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 H TIMOL\n After the early evening prayers they came back again.  I asked who they were, they identified themselves as security police.  They stood and I asked them to have a seat.  One of the police pushed me violently onto the seat.  I stood up and I asked what happened, and they told me that my son had jumped from the tenth floor of John Vorster Square and that he had died and that he was ...(intervention)",

I then saw the son and I had noticed that he had been assaulted and was full of blood and that the whole face was covered in blood.  At about quarter past \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n6 H TIMOL\nthree they took the funeral.  They hit my son tremendously.

They asked to see my husband and they were told that he could not come as he was sitting for prayer.  Mr Buys and Mr Ficks and the third policeman I can't remember his name.  They asked me about the whereabouts of my husband and I told them that he was in the mosque and that my son was taking food to him and they insisted that my husband should come home.  I told them that he could not come as he was sitting in mosque for a period of ten days. And they told me that my other son in Durban, if I wanted to see him I could see him tonight if he would work for us and that the public should not know and they then said that they wanted to see my husband.  We took them to the mosque.\n(The Interpreter asks the witness to talk a bit slower so that it could be interpreted correctly).\n Thereafter I took them to the mosque and someone came out from the mosque and called my husband and they told my husband that if he wanted to see my son, they spoke in \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n7 H TIMOL\nEnglish and in Afrikaans, and told him that if you want to see the son in Durban then he's got to work for us and that the public should not know about it that he's working for us.  I told them that if my body had a zip they could open the zip to see how I was aching inside.  My late husband could not speak and Buys gave him the telephone number and said phone me in Pretoria and ask for Mr Buys, and said that my son will come back tonight.  \n They interrogated us tremendously thereafter and I still need to know who killed my son and how is it possible that he would jump from the tenth floor to commit suicide.  He was a teacher at the Indian school and was well liked by the pupils.  And I cannot be expected to forgive at this stage.  They hit him very badly.

I have known both you and in some ways your brother many years ago too, and I was wondering if you would be able to say a little more about your brother, because we have heard from your mother that he was a teacher at Roodepoort School and that at the time of his death that is where he was teaching, but perhaps you could just give us a little more testimony as to who your brother was and what his involvement was that led to his arrest and subsequent death.",

I am actually very pleased that you have asked this question.\nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n9 M TIMOL\nLiving now in a democratic South Africa it affords us an opportunity to actually relate contributions of individuals, one is able to relate the contributions of individuals to bring about a democratic dispensation in South Africa.\n To start off I would like to say that Ahmed grew up in a very religious orthodox family of the Islamic faith.  He grew up at a time when there was intense oppression in South Africa, and as a young Indian Moslem he too became affected by what was happening in this country, the injustices committed against the vast majority of the people of South Africa, those who were not White.\n In his early years he became influenced by the political situation and he became a young activist of the Indian Congress.  He completed his schooling and went for training to become a schoolteacher.  ...(tape ends)  South Africa on exit permit to live in exile.  It seemed that this really affected him tremendously.\n In 1966 at the young age of 24 he left South Africa and went to Mecca to perform Hadj which is compulsory for every adult Moslem.  After completing his Hadj he thereafter went to England and he lived with his very close friends Essop Pahad and Aziz Pahad.  Aziz Pahad is presently the deputy foreign minister of this country.  And Essop Pahad is a member of Parliament.  \n The three years that he spent in England he taught as a schoolteacher in London and through his contact of meeting other people in London I think he finally reached a decision that he had to return to South Africa to participate in the underground struggle.\n It was during this period he also came into contact with a prominent South African Indian by the name of Dr \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n10 M TIMOL\nYusuf Dadoo, I am sure all of us do know him or have heard of him.  I think it was Ahmed's commitment to bring about a just society that he felt that he had to return to South Africa during a very dark period when the security police and the securocrenjoying is as a result of Bubla Salojee, Ahmed Timol, Hector Petersen and many, many countless and thousands of other young and old, men and women, who have made it possible for us to sit here today and listen to testimonies of mothers and relatives who have lost their loved ones in the cause of the struggle in this country.\n Thank you.",

The pathologist, the independent pathologist who was an observer at the post mortem was a prominent South African by the name of Jonathan Gluckman who performed many a post mortem of detainees who had died in detention.  Gluckman's contention and argument during the inquest was that there were bruises and torture marks on Ahmed's body and he could have only sustained that during the period of detention.  But the district surgeon representing the State argued that those bruises could not have happened prior to his detention.  He actually argued that it took place before detention and not during detention.
