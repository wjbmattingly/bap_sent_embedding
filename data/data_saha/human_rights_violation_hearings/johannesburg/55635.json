I didn't see Andrew that day.  I saw him only during the day when he went to town to buy clothes for the child and he said he has a pain in the leg and he wants to go to the doctor.  I was only surprised to see it was four o'clock and he wasn't coming back.  And then I realised it's now six o'clock, I have to call and find out his whereabouts.  They said to me no he picked up his belongings and he went home.  I said maybe he's gone somewhere else.  He will come back.  That was the situation till the next morning.\n At eight o'clock I called his place of work and then I discovered that it wasn't open.  I called his granny, that's JOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 M MAKOPE\nAndrew's granny.  I called her and she said I went to work to find out what was happening, Andrew left with the keys and everything.  And she called me and she said we broke the key, we will buy another one, let's just go and search for him.  We went to the police station and I gave them the statement.  That was the first day.  \n I was welcomed by Mr Phuta.  In the middle of the statement he said no, I am not going to write this statement.  Are you telling me this is Freddy's brother?  No, maybe Andrew went along with his brother and he left the statement in the middle.  But tomorrow morning make it a point that you are here.\n Well the following day I went early.  I remained there until it was one.  I even requested them to fetch my child because I didn't feed the child at all.  Many White policemen came in.  They took me into Sergeant Ghanyani's office and they said to me your husband has run away from you, he's in Botswana.  If I really agree with what they say they will go to Botswana and go and search for him.  They will only do that if I give them certain information.  I didn't know anything.  And they told me they will build me a house.  They even indicated that he left me with a very small baby.  I said to them there is nothing I can tell you.   Well I left the police station.  They said they will call me back.  They called me, they asked me questions relating to Freddy as well as Andrew.  I told them never to ask me any question about Freddy, what I want is only Andrew.  And they said Andrew has been picked up by his brother because he wants to go and be with him.  They never contacted me anymore.\n We started our own investigations.  We went to the \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 M MAKOPE\nhospitals.  I started losing my mind.  I was sick.  Andrew's mother and Andrew's father supported me throughout until today, because since his disappearance I have never been employed.",

There were two people with guns and they grabbed him out of his car and they put him inside the combi, and they told that girl that\nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n6 M MAKOPE\nshe must come back inside the car.  She had already alighted out of the car.  So somebody was driving the car with this girl and they were following this combi and they went passed home.

But after they had turned the corner they hooted to stop the car and then the car stopped.

They came out through the Cullinan route.  When they arrived at a depot, there was some depot somewhere before, before you arrived at Cullinan, they stopped there in Andrew's car and Andrew's car stopped and the combi also stopped behind it.  Those who were in the combi came towards the window of that, Andrew's car and said get out of the car.  She thought they were going to kill her.
