You are very welcome.  Thank you for coming.\n The next witness that we invite to the witness stand is Mr James Simpson.  Mr Simpson I would like to extend a very warm word of welcome to you and to express the appreciation of the Commission for your willingness to come and tell the story which really changed your life as well, and many others who were involved in that disaster.  You will probably will want to give your evidence in Afrikaans.  Could I ask you to stand to take the oath.",

It's 13 years ago but I am sure that it's very vivid in your memory and in your body as well as your spirit.  Mr Wynand Malan, one of our Commissioners is going to assist you to tell that story to all of us here and so many others who are listening outside and indeed across the world.  We are very grateful indeed for your being here.  I will ask my colleague to take over.  Thank you.",

Thank you very much for coming today and I believe that your first language is Afrikaans so we will do your evidence in Afrikaans.  The facts which are coming cause is that the bomb exploded on the 20th of May 1983 and if you look at various sources it would seem as if 19 people were killed and 219 injured.  One of the sources indicate that 12 people were civilians and 7 were security force personnel, 8 were Black people, 11 were Whites.  An inquest was held and according to the inquest records shows that Freddie Shongwe and Ezekiel Maseko planted the bomb.  They were both killed in the blast.  It was also found, rightly or wrongly that both of them were members of the ANC.  That's common cause and against this background I'd like to hear your first hand account of what happened there.",

            "In 1983 I worked at the firm of Olivetti.  We were on the first and second floors of the Nedbank building.  I worked on the first floor and we were quite close to the window.  Most of the people working close to the windows were injured.  When the bomb exploded it was the shattering glass which caused the most damage.  It cut people, the doors were blown off their hinges and that kind of thing.\n Immediately after the explosion I didn't know what had happened because my glasses were missing, they were blown off my face, my watch had been ripped off my arm, I couldn't see properly and I didn't know what was happening.  My face was full of blood. I was led out of the building.  When I got to the street down below I saw cars burning, injured people lying around.  I spoke to one of my colleagues there, we were waiting for an ambulance there on the pavement.  The ambulances had already taken the most seriously injured people away so we had quite a long wait until one of the \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 J SIMPSON\nsales reps took us to the hospital in his car.  The people landed up in different hospitals.  That's how it happened.  A lot of people were injured, a lot of damage was caused.  Now my sympathy lies with the people who were badly injured and never recovered.  That is the big thing.  That is why I came here today.",
