Mr Beck on behalf of the Commission I'd like to extend a very warm word of welcome to you this afternoon.  You've had a long morning listening to many stories and yours of course is very different from some of the others.  But because the Commission is mandated by the Act to receive all who are victims of violence or human rights violations I want you to know that you are welcome and that we are very grateful to you that you have come to tell your story, because all these stories are part of the whole fabric of South Africa which we are trying to unravel.

            "May we, before I give you an opportunity to talk about your experience of human rights violations I will briefly remind the participants and address the Commissioners on the background to your experience.\n In 1988 Soweto was still under a total state of emergency.  Countrywide over 5,000 people were detained and over 1,149 people killed in political violence.  In February 1988 P W Botha amended the state of emergency regulations giving the Minister of Law and Order the power to restrict the activities of organisations or individuals if he was of the opinion that it was necessary.  To enforce these restrictions and the state of emergency the SAP and SADF presence in townships was strengthened.  \n Meanwhile for the ANC the arms struggle continued despite rumours that it was ready to negotiate with the government.  1988 was named the Year of United Action towards People's Power.  According to the Minister of Law and Order Mr Vlok 144 policemen were killed in the years 1984 to 1987.  Vlok further added that it was not possible to distinguish which of the murders were politically motivated.\n In April 1988 there were at least five documented cases of political attacks on police including the attack on Gregory Edmund Beck and three other policemen.\n Having said all that I will ask you to address the \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 G BECK\nCommission, briefly tell them your involvement as a policeman and your experiences around the incident that you have come here to talk to us about.",

            "Right.  On the night of the 22nd April 1988 I reported for duty.  At that time I was doing crime prevention duties, I was in the uniformed branch.  I am now a detective attached to Soweto Investigation Unit holding the rank of Detective Inspector.  At that time I was a sergeant.\n I reported for duty at 18H00 and I was supposed to complete my duties the following morning at six o'clock.  My duties were to patrol the area of Soweto, and we had warrants that were executed on people who partook in the rent boycotts at that time.  I was accompanied by three other constables and I was the sergeant in charge.  \n Well during the night, at about midnight we had already arrested three civilians, that was in the area of Emndeni.  I was supposed to take these three civilians to the rental office at Zola where they would get further instructions on how to go about paying the arrears of their rents.\n On my way from Emndeni to Zola at about five minutes before one o'clock in the night, opposite house, I think it's house 2975 and 2976 Emndeni our patrol was ambushed.  It was very dark I couldn't see anything.  I was the driver of the vehicle.  I just suddenly heard the sound of automatic and rapid fire from - machine gun fire.  Then I heard screams at the back, from the people at the back of the van that I was patrolling with were hit, one civilian was hit through the neck.  And then suddenly I heard shots all over round me that was shot from the sides, concentrating on my position as the driver.\nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 G BECK\n The shots riddled through the bodywork of the vehicle, past my body, past my head and shattered the windscreen and windows of the vehicle.  I then accelerated to pick up speed in order to get the people to safety and I didn't know whether my assailants were on foot or by car, but eventually the engine of the vehicle was struck and I was hit through the right leg at the tibia several times.  \n We were demobilised.  I could hear my bones breaking the way the shots hit my leg and I was then out of action and I told my fellow colleagues to jump out and take cover.  I had a portable radio in my hand and I then took cover behind a tree and radioed for assistance to the control room and the members of the control room sent the duty officer, reinforcements as well as an ambulance to the scene.  I was out of action at that time.  \n I then learnt that one of the civilians, I don't know his name, the male, was hit through the neck and was in a very critical condition.  One of the policeman, a constable, was hit through the - with a flesh wound, through the thigh, and I was hit through the tibia several times with AK47 rifles.",

It was mostly the specialist policemen, the Security Police, Murder and Robbery and all those kind of guys who knew about these type of operations, and as we are now in the transparent and new South Africa more of these incidents are now revealed.  Now it becomes more clear to me what was really going on and the balance between the State at that time and the liberation movements, and I can see the viewpoint of the liberation movement as well, which they hold, or which they held to bring about what we are experiencing in this new South Africa of ours, and that cost us all to be liberated, so therefore I don't bear any grudges against anybody for what happened, although I was a victim of it, but I understand now.

You testify to a change that happened in you with regard to your perceptions about the liberation movement and the struggle and you say it is in part because you have come to learn of the atrocities that were committed.\n Now the Commission is in fact being charged with telling this story, not so that we should be masochists who enjoy pain, our pain, the pain of others, that we should in fact then, as the Act says, transcend, rise above the conflicts of the past and ultimately if we are going to have the change then it is clear that forgiveness, reconciliation, are quite central to that process.  And justice is an element of it as well.  But forgiveness \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n11 G BECK\nultimately is to say you give people the chance to change.  You open a door for someone to move from a dark past to a new and enlightened present and future.  We hope that people like yourselves and the many who will be telling their stories, not always in public hearings such as this one, will help to contribute and we are glad that we can now begin to own the police and the defence force, and be able to say these are now ours, as you begin to change and are rehabilitated.
