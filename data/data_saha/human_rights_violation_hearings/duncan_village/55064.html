<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">S MACWASHE:</span> We were playing and the soldiers came and shot us.  Our mistake is that we ran away.  My friends were running away and I told them not to, but they ran away and they left me there alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> While I was there alone, I asked myself why am I not running and then I ran and that was the mistake I did.</p>

<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> In your statement you said that while visiting your friend you saw a hippo going to where you were staying.  What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">S MACWASHE:</span> When - I was scared.  I ran away and I ran into the house and they told me that the hippo doesn't want me, it was just passing.  It stopped near my house.</p>

<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What did they do to you after you told them who you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">S MACWASHE:</span> They said they are taking me with their hippo.</p>

<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">S MACWASHE:</span> I said to them I'm not going with them, because I didn't know where I was going. They just said I must come with them and then I said to them they must tell the owner of the house where they are taking me, so that the owner can tell my father where I was, but they didn't do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a> What they did, they tried to push me to the hippo and we struggled, because I didn't want to go with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you go to the hippo with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">S MACWASHE:</span> Yes, I did because they all struggled with me, taking me with them to the hippo.  They drove around the township and then they went with me to the C-Section, but unfortunately they were looking for a certain number, but they asked a man who just arrived at this Section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a> They also took that man and they assaulted him.  While they were doing that to that man, they wanted him to say that he is an informer to tell people that he is an informer, because at that time, if you were found to be an informer people were burning you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">S MACWASHE:</span> After that they said that they - that man must go out, but he couldn't because the door was high and they kicked him out while the hippo was still moving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you know what happened to that man?</p>

<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>and they took my finger prints and then I told them that I didn't do anything, why should they take my finger prints.  That is where they started kicking me, they forced me, they forced to take my finger prints and they were assaulting me at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you remember any soldiers or policemen who were there?</p>
