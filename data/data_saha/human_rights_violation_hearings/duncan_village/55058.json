You would think that this is not important, but it is important to the Truth Commission for us to listen to the stories which you brought forward.\n They give us a full picture and this wouldn't be clear if people didn't come forward.  We were given this opportunity as a Commission to draw a picture, a clear picture of what was happening at that time which the Parliament gave us to investigate.  We were also given this task to give a full picture of the bad and good things which happened during the struggle period.\n I think your story shows clearly the activities people took in the struggle, some are involved because in a way which they were not supposed to be involved.  \n And the aim of the Act promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation is to say to this nation, this is what has happened to this nation.  These are the things that were done to each other and for this nation to say \"never again must these things ever happen.\"\n Thank you for coming here in front of this Commission to give us the picture you gave us and the request you gave to this Commission, we will look into your request and Revd \nDUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n9\nXundu have said, we cannot guarantee that we will respond, but the President will see what he can do.  I thank you, both of you.",
