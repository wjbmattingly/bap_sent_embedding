<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a> I just woke up there the next day in the ward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What really happened on that day?</p>

<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> There are two questions I have for you.  The first one, you were in your yard hanging out napkins when you were shot and you say that you saw a mello yello.  Now was there anybody else in the yard with you - a witness to the shooting of you that actually saw it happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">NT MVANDABA:</span> I'm not sure whether there is someone inside here who can verify that but everybody in my Section knows that I was shot while I was in the washing line.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And the second question that I have for you</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>8 NT MVANDABA</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>is did you ever approach an attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">NT MVANDABA:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you.  Please proceed Ntsikelelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Let us now go to Mr Christopher Majuba.  I would like to greet you Mr Majuba.  Looking at your statement, there is a request that you should make an appearance before this Commission to explain and tell what happened to your brother Themba Majuba on a Wednesday in August 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a> Looking at this statement again you say you were absent at the time, but when you arrived you got the information that your brother had been shot dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a> Could you explain further what actually happened on this day in particular.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes, I can.  I think the fact that in the statement is reflected that I was not there, is a mistake because when I got there I saw Themba and I asked for the key to the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a> And I asked him to go and get the key to the house.  And instead of him coming back, a child came back with the key telling me that Themba had gone to the shop and that was at about seven o'clock at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a> So I waited for him until very late at night and I went to sleep.  The following morning a friend of mine, Nolexi Buswana came to see me and he asked me that I should go to a meeting at Skonzana Stadium so we went there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a> And as we were talking as comrades I was told that the people whose relatives were missing should go to hospital and to the police station or to the mortuary to look for that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Was Themba missing at the time?</p>

<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>9 C MAJUBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes, he did not come back on Wednesday and even on Thursday I went to bed not knowing anything about his whereabouts. So I decided to send his friends to go and check for him at the police station and hospital and they couldn't find him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a> And on Friday morning I went to the police station and hospital to go and search for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is this the Duncan Village police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You did not find him there and you proceeded to the Cambridge police station and you couldn't find him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> I went to hospital and I couldn't find him, then I proceeded to the mortuary in Cambridge and I met a short man who asked me what I wanted, then I told him I was looking for my brother who was missing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a> And he asked me what was he wearing when I last saw him so I explained to him that he had a blue duster coat and he said this description suited someone who was there in the mortuary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Was that the police station mortuary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> So you ultimately saw the body and identified it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes, he showed me the body and I identified the body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What did you see on his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> I noticed that there was a hole on his head which was quite big and bad and his head was crushed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Didn't you asked how it had happened that his body was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> I couldn't ask because the man said he had found the body laying there in the mortuary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>10 C MAJUBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> By the same you say you went back home to go and tell the people at home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Was it at home that you discovered that comrades told you about the lawyers that were handling matters of this nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes.  A few days later comrades came and informed me about some lawyers that were stationed at the Roman Catholic Church who were handling matters of the people whose relatives had been murdered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you perhaps see any of these lawyers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes, we went as a family to see these lawyers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Who were these lawyers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> I can remember Mr Lalla.  I think even Mr Nisasuwi was one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you talk to these lawyers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> The lawyers said they had come to our assistance and also they wanted to have statements in order to investigate about these matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Which lawyer did you actually talk to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> We talked to Mr Lalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is there any other thing that you had or perhaps some correspondence from Mr Lalla which you've got?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> No.   What happened is in 1989 one day I got some summons from the Lloyd police station which as from Mr Colonel de Vos asking me that I should go to court on a particular date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you go to court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Before I went to court, I took this summons and took it to Mr Lalla, but I couldn't find him.  And I went on frequently until I got Mr Lalla and explained everything to</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>11 C MAJUBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>him and gave the summons to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a> And he asked whether I had never received any letter from their office.  I told them no I had never received it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a> And he insisted that he had sent us a letter, but we had not received this letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What did he say was the contents of the letter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> He did not explain, but I determined that he was not telling the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you ever leave your house after you had met Mr Lalla for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Then you say Mr Lalla promised that he would go with you to court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes, that's what he said but I decided not to wait and I decided to go to his office so that we should go together to court and he agreed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you get him on the day at this office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> I went to his office, but I didn't find him and what I did was to go direct to the court and that is where I found him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a> And we were called into the court and after tea time Mr Lalla was called in by the Magistrate and they said they were adjourning the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What was it that they were talking about here in court?  Were there some suspects that could have killed your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> We were the only two people that were connected to this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> According to what you heard did they perhaps refer to this case as an inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>12 C MAJUBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What was the outcome of the inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> It was the second time that we were going to court and Mr Lalla told me that my brother had been shot by a police from Pretoria and the third time we went to court I  again received a summons from Mr de Vos and I went there on my own because Mr Lalla was unavailable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a> And he wouldn't tell me of the outcome of the court case.  Then I heard about a Prosecutor that they were saying my brother's body was found laying down and there were stones in his hands, but I wasn't happy with this explanation because I feel it wasn't true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Now ultimately Mr Majuba, did you actually get to know who actually killed your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> The Prosecutors told me that it was a police from Pretoria and a security police, but they said they found him, my brother, dead but guilty because he had been found with stones, which means that they had been stoning the police vans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you again go back to Mr Lalla and discuss this matter so as to have a way forward in as far as this problem is concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> I tried as I was advised by the Senior Prosecutor who told me that Mr Lalla had failed and therefor I had to look for another lawyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes, I did go to another lawyer in Nasbank and there was an Indian guy that I talked to and he said he was going to talk to Mr Lalla but I went on that day and this Indian man said it would be very difficult for him to take over from Mr Lalla, because they were working together, so he advised me that I should go to another lawyer, or he</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>13 C MAJUBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>referred me to the BLACK SASH.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a> And then he asked me to go outside with the intention to phone to Grahamstown, so as to find out what was happening with this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a> And he said to me this case was known in Grahamstown and I don't know who these people were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Now you say at the time you were talking to this lawyer, you could not claim, you could not institute a claim on this death, now you say in your statement you went to offices of the Lawyers for Human Rights, here in East London - did they say the time had expired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes, that's what they said, but I wouldn't take this because this is what happened in 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I see that you also wrote a letter to the Minister of Safety and Security, when was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> It was in November, last year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you get any response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> No, I'm still waiting for the response even now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all you would like to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> I would say I also gave a statement to the BLACK SASH and I was attended to by a White lawyer who wrote down the statement and they promised to write to me and they did, calling me to their office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a> And they asked me to go and get my file from Mr Lalla so as to be able to look into the details in the file, and proceed with the case.  This is the time when Lalla was not going to the court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Now, could we now talk about Themba?  How old was Themba at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Themba was 20 years old at the time and he was working at Nash and he was about to go for initiation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you perhaps have requests that you would like to forward to this Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes, I wish that this Commission should now take over because my intention was to institute a claim for the death of my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all you have to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes, I've said everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Majuba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Over to you Revd Xundu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you Chairman.  Mr Majuba, did Themba have any family?  Was Themba married?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> No, but he had a child with another lady and that child is about 13 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> That is family.  Now how old is that child now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> He is about 13 or 14.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Does he go to school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes, he goes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you know the names of the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Her name is Siabonga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Over to you, June Crichton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mr Majuba, we wait for you.  I have three short questions.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> The letter that you sent to the Minister of Safety and Security, do you by any chance have a copy of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> That's where I made the mistake, because when I was writing this letter, I did not have a copy to keep with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>15 C MAJUBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And the second question is the Senior Public Prosecutor that you spoke to, do you know what his name was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> I do not know his name, because even in court the Lawyers for Human Rights did go to that office and did not find the short man I had talked to who was a White man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Then I am misunderstanding you completely, I thought the short man was the man at the mortuary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> Even the Senior Prosecutor was short, stout and speaking Xhoza though he was White.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you.  And then you said you had gathered information from the people who witnessed the incident that the police shot Themba.  Have those names been documented, can you write a list of those names for us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">C MAJUBA:</span> I know that those people who informed me are here in this very hall and if you need them, they will surely come up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> We thank you all for your evidence.  I would like to make a summary because as far as we can see, this hearing of the Duncan Village massacre, we are not going to put it aside and close the file.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a> But I would like to make a summary so that this should be kept in record so that we should know how far we have gone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a> I am therefor going to say the Commission has listened with shock to testimonies of mass murder.  The picture has been placed before the Commission of a village which was turned into a war zone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a> The witnesses who came before the Commission they pointed their fingers to the SADF and the South African police who according to the information placed before us,</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>16</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>went on the rampage for three successive days engaging themselves in a warfare with a small, impoverished, deprived and neglected community of people who were unarmed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a> In this part of the hearing we have seen men and children and children shed tears for their loved ones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a> We note that according to the evidence, that has been placed before us up to this time, the Government which was in power at that time, whose security forces were involved in this massacre, was left cold by the mass murder of the people of Duncan Village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a> We note also that no action was taken to order a judicial enquiry into this event.  According to the evidence placed before us at this time, even the so called opposition parties in Parliament which have claimed to have a very clean record of Human Rights advocacy have according to the evidence before us, done nothing to force the Government of the day to order an judicial enquiry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a> So as far as we are concerned, after listening from the morning session of yesterday and the morning session of today, the victims of the Duncan Village massacre, we note that this hearing is not closed, the file of this hearing will remain open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a> There are a few things that we want to place on record to be requested.  We are requesting the SADF and the SAPS to deliver to us as a matter of urgency a full list of the officers who were in charge of the SADF and the SAP here in East London at the time, because we will need them to come before the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a> We need the names of Doctors and other medical personnel who were in charge of the hospitals involved with the victims of this massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>17</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a> We need a submission by the MD's of Companies who have been cited as accomplices in the testimonies that we have listened to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a> Lastly, for us to complete our hearing we need a submission by a person in authority who can represent the RSA Government at the time to answer some questions which we are having about the massacre that took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a> As soon as this evidence has been placed before us or this information has been placed before us, we are then going to convene another hearing possibly here in this hall, where we will complete the hearing of the Duncan Village massacre. </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a> My colleague has just passed on a note that in my summation I must also request that the attorneys who were representing the victims, specially there is an attorney here who is mentioned constantly, we would like that attorney also to make a submission so that we can then take all those submissions into consideration before we draw our final report on the Duncan Village massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a> I would like to thank the people who have given us their testimony and your bravery, the way you have shown that though you have gone through this suffering, we salute those who died.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a> We say that although you live in one of the most deprived areas in the country, one of the most disadvantaged areas.  Yesterday we took a walk just to look round here in Duncan Village, and we were shocked by what we saw, the amount of deprivation that is visible in this place of Duncan Village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a> But these people who have testified before us, have shown that although they come from that kind of area, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>18</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>remain strong and undaunted and we salute them and we say thank you to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a> We will come back at two o'clock to listen to other cases as in their correlated (indistinct) at four o'clock, we stand again then until two o'clock.</p>
