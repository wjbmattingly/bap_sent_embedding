I think your evidence reminded us that while we were still fighting for freedom, there were mistakes we did at the time we were struggling.\n There are things which happened that when we look back, we will feel embarrassed about them.  We thank you for reminding us in this Duncan Village hearing in such a powerful manner of those mistakes.\n We thank you for clarifying that those who were leaders of people at that time, they tried to take action before this Commission.  They tried to come and ask for forgiveness on behalf of those who did this.\n I think yesterday when Mr Jordan was submitting the report here, he touched on such events.  He said that some of these events were done by people who claimed to be members of the African National Congress, and he asked for forgiveness for those things.\n We thank you for reminding us towards the end of this hearing, that the Human Rights were not only violated by the DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n11\noppressors, but within us, there were other people who were oppressing others.\n Your requests will be taken into consideration and we will follow whatever we have to follow because our aim is that we want South Africa to be peaceful and to have a better future.\n Things like this, we want to make things like this not to happen again in this country.  Thank you very much, we also thank your daughter, who accompanied you so that we can see her.\n You can now go back to your place and we will now call the last witness, which is Zuko Galela and after that we will close the hearing.",
