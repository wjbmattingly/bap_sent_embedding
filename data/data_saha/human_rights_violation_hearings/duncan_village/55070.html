<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> I'll start from the beginning like this.  In 1985, we were still using busses.  After work we were told by the driver of the bus, that the bus is  not going to get in Duncan Village because there are hippo's who are shooting people who are shooting people, even the bus could be shot at.</p>

<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>2 MT MBEWANA</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a> We alighted at Dugashe and we walked, it was already dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a> There were people who were laying on the ground, being shot.  I managed to reach the C-Section, I was staying at Section 13, but my children were not there any the house was open, and my wife was not there also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a> I went to my next door neighbour's house, I found my wife behind the door and she told me that the soldiers are around and they are just shooting randomly at everybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> I told her that I saw this also, I also saw this boers.  MR SANDI: Which time are you referring to now, Mr Mbewana?  Were you on your way to work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> No.  We didn't sleep on that particular day because the soldiers were shooting all over.  The following day...</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Mr Mbewana, I would like to request that we stick on those events that are here on your statement, because in your statement you say you were shot at and evidence that you are giving now, should stick on that.

<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> Early the following day there were people who were toyi-toying from the other direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a> They were saying that we must go and break that bridge so that the boers must not be able to go over the bridge to reach our place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were you already shot at this time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I would like to lead you Mr Mbewana, you said when you were at Ndzuzu Street, where is this Ndzuzu Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>3 MT MBEWANA</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> Ndzuzu Street is just on the other side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You say you saw a casper coming from the direction of Ford Street to join the Ndzuzu Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> Yes, that's correct, that's what happened.  Because this hippo was in front of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You say this casper came to your direction, is that what you are saying?  Who was inside this police casper?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> When this hippo turned, I gave way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> Some soldiers, White soldiers, alighted from this vehicle, and they didn't ask any question, they shot me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Where did they shoot you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> On my eyes.  I couldn't realise immediately that I was shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Which eye was that?  Is that the right eye or the left eye?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> It is my left eye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Then what happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> I heard a voice of people that the hippo had passed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> ; Did you fall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> Yes, I fell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were there any utterings that were made by this soldiers while you were laying there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> I don't remember hearing any of their voices, but I just heard ordinary people saying that I must be helped, I must be taken into a certain vehicle and be taken to the hospital together with the other people from the C-Section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>4 MT MBEWANA</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were you taken to the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> Yes, I was.  In this van I was taken by this van to the hospital.  I lost consciousness while the vehicle was next to the hostel, I regained my consciousness the following day in the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What hospital were you admitted in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> I was in Frere Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> When you regained your consciousness there, what was happening?  In what condition were you in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> When I woke up there, when I touched my face, I didn't feel any pain, but I could see that, I could feel that there was something, but I discovered that the other side of me was swollen and I asked for a mirror so as to see what was happening, and then they said you are shot.  There is no need for a mirror, there is only a bandage on your face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You say while you were in hospital, the soldiers were visiting you regularly.  What is it that they were looking for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> They were just asking people concerning their injuries, whether they got injured at Duncan Village or wherever, but I didn't tell them, because all the people who were there, were under regard of the soldiers and after that person had recovered, that particular person would be taken by the soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were the soldiers going there in the evening or maybe during the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> They used to visit the hospital day and night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were there nurses and Doctors there when the soldiers were visiting the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>5 MT MBEWANA</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were they asking for any permission from the nurses and Doctors to talk to the patients who were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> I don't know any idea whether they were getting permission or they were just doing that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You say whenever you saw this soldiers, you used to hide and have you ever - did you tell the nurses and the Doctors that the soldiers used to come there and ask for the folders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> No, I didn't, because they used to come to the hospital in the presence of the nurses and Doctors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> So do you think there was a certain connection between the nurses and the soldiers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> I think the nurses were scared of the soldiers also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you approach any attorney Mr Mbewana, concerning this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You didn't hear that maybe there were certain lawyers that the people who were shot at, used to visit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> I was told that there are lawyers, but my uncle said that, my other uncle who is a policeman is going to ill-treat me if I can lay charges against the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What uncle are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> He died, he used to stay at Ediping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What department was he in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> He was not a police, but he was just a driver at Mlambabeki.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all Mr Mbewana that you would like to tell us?  Is there anything that you would like to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> Yes, there is something else because even now DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>6 MT MBEWANA</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>that I have recovered, I had a car - people know that car.  One day I was driving with Bravido who was accompanying me to the petrol station.  When I was going passed the shops, there were soldiers who were pointing their guns downwards, when I came back, there was another boy, they said I must turn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a> I must take this car to the camp, military base that was there.  We went inside, we were ordered to face the wall and open our legs, we had to place our hands on the wall</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>and they asked this boy - this little boy asked me why did I make a certain sign to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Besides that you are injured in your eye, what else, where else were you injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> My both thighs were injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is there any treatment that you are getting or maybe you are in a condition that allows you to get  medical attention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> What I can say is this, I am no longer like before.  I was not a short-tempered person before, even at work, I always quarrel over petty issues.  Even the staff at work is aware of that, so my state of mind is no longer the same as before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is there any other way that you were affected by this shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> The most important thing is concerning my nerves.  I'm just nervous and when I am looking at my health, my whole being, I am not the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is there anything that you would like to say Mr Mbewana, just before I ask you another question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> There is something else.  The other day I was driving from Mr Bravido's house.</p>

<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>7 MT MBEWANA</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were you shot on that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> No, I was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I would like you to tell us about the day when you were shot or maybe something happened, maybe the assault.   What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> When I arrived at home, my home is next to the road.  I discovered that I couldn't get in because there were soldiers blocking the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> I just decided that I am going to force my way, I'm going to force my way to my yard.  I did so.  When I alighted from my car, the soldiers were already standing next to my car and they said to me, come kaffir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a> They were calling me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> In your statement, Mr Mbewana, you referred to the people who shot you.  Do you still remember that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you.  Were you in this condition because you were a political activist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MT MBEWANA:</span> On that particular day I was still a silent member, I was not yet any member of the political organisation, because I was afraid of my uncles.</p>
