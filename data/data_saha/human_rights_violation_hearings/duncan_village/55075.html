<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> These are the people who said you were shot by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">W VANDOYI:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Why did they refuse to support you since they have this important information about your story and their information seems to be the only one who can help this case to continue?  Why did they refuse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">W VANDOYI:</span> They said they were afraid, they were scared of being arrested, because at that time people were arrested a lot.  In 1986 people were arrested when testifying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Since we are free now, why are they still afraid?</p>

<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you.  Dr Kahn, as you have mentioned him in your statement, was he the Doctor who examined you after you got injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">W VANDOYI:</span> Yes, he also sent me to Mr Lalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Was it Dr Kahn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">W VANDOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Where can we reach him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">W VANDOYI:</span> I think he left this place, he is in Cape Town.  He was here in day, in day hospital then, but he is in Cape Town now.  Maybe you'll find he's there in the hospital although he's gone.  My file is still there, I forgot something.  After I went, going to Jeram, I didn't get my file in the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a> I looked for it, but I couldn't find it, and they made me a new one - the second one.  I couldn't find the first file.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you Mr  Wilson Vandoyi for submitting the statement.  As we have already said, we would like as a Commission to meet with these two witnesses and we will also try to investigate and to find out where are the files for Dr Kahn so that we can get details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a> We'd like to thank you for bringing this forward.  This is our chance to try to continue with your case.  We will try by all means to try and help you with your case.  Thank you.</p>
