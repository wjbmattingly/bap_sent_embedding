<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>REVD FINCA: We have you here in this hearing.  I must also thank you for the way you handled us yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a> And even your resounding attendance and your respect that you awarded to us because - and you showed that you see the seriousness of this work whereby we have to listen to the painful things that happened to the people during the times of repression.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a> Once more these witnesses here in front of us are going to give their evidence to this Commission and we hope that you are once more going to show the respect to them as they come forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a> I will also like to extend and convey a message from Archbishop Reverend Desmond Tutu, who is the Chairman of this Commission.  He has said that due to his involvement somewhere, he is unable to be present here with us, but he would like to say to all of you especially to the witnesses, his greetings and he cares so much about whatever you have to say to this Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a> Let me once more introduce to you this panel of my colleagues who work with me in this hearing in Duncan Village and we are a part of the main Commission though we are based here in the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a> Firstly I would like to introduce to you on my extreme left, Adv Sandi who has taken a long time working and learning a lot about the Human Right issues and he even had </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>2</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>to go to Universities abroad and therefor his name came up as one of the people to form this Commission.  He hails from Grahamstown and he helps people who want to get assistance whenever they have some serious cases.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a> Next to me here the lady seated next to me is June Crichton.  She comes from work as an activist for Human Rights issues as a member of BLACK SASH and also as an active member of the Anglican Church.  There was a time when she was away from our region because of ill health, she has recently returned to rejoin the work of our region.  We are delighted to have her, she comes from Port Elizabeth, June Crichton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> Next to me we have a lady - with her experience by the name of Tiny Maya who hails from Umtata and who has been working for the Black Lawyers' Association during the time of oppression.  At the time they were this law that has made it possible that there should be this Commission.  Dulah Omar sent out some lawyer's to the overseas countries to go and observe what happens during the transitional period, so Mr Maya was one of those people who was sent overseas to go and observe and get some more information in preparation for this.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a> Next to Ms Maya we've got a young man there who is - comes from Port Elizabeth.  As you can see he is quite young, and he is Revd Xundu, who is one who has had great contribution during our struggle in this country.  And his leadership is well known in the country.  He has worked for a long time in Transkei during the Mtanzima regime, being arrested and locked in and I would have to take care of his family during his absence.  He again moved on to Lamontville in Natal such that he narrowly escaped death, but he is </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>3</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>presently based in Port Elizabeth - one of the most outstanding leaders of our people through the time of struggle.  He is a member of the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a> So I happen to be the head of all these distinguished people which has made it possible for this region to progress because these are stable people and people who are rooted in this community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a> We are then going to start with our work on this last day here in Duncan Village by listening to and focusing on the massacre that occurred on the three days from the 10th to the 12th of August in 1985, which erupted from the funeral of Griffiths, of Ms Victoria Mxenge's funeral.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a> With intention that we are going to be through with that and after lunch, we shall therefor listen to cases of Human Rights Violation, with intention to finish up by four o'clock.  We shall now hand over to Tiny Maya.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Just before Tiny Maya tells us the order, maybe there is no need to introduce to you, but I think it is important, this is Revd Finca from the Chairman of the Board of Council, here in this area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a> He is President at (indistinct) and he is one Reverend who at the time of (indistinct) fall, he was asked to take his place, so because he has been in leadership for quite some time and this makes us to feel good and relaxed so I would like to say in his own right, he is a fully fledged leader that is quite distinguished and he is here in this Commission rightfully, especially at this time so let us greet him.  Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you very much, Chairperson.  Let me greet you Mr Rubushe, this morning.  How are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> I am fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Let me confirm first, your names, your full names, you are Wele Rubushe, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Today by being here in front of the Commission, you are going to tell about something that happened to you</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>6 W RUBUSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>in August 1985 when it was early int he morning.  You were shot, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I am going to hand over to you so that you can tell us in details how did this happened.  What happened on that particular day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> In 1985, it was early in the morning, I remember it was on a Tuesday, I was coming from the toilet.  When I was nearer to the house, I saw a hippo, a casper which was at a distance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a> When I was still looking at this hippo one White man alighted from the police casper.  While I was still looking at this, I fell.  I felt a bullet, when I tried to stand up, I couldn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a> I lost my consciousness.  I regained my consciousness at the hospital, I think it was at (indistinct) day.  After that I remained in hospital, I think I was in the hospital for three months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a> When I was discharged from the hospital I was taking a treatment until 1986.  At least the pain was no longer as serious but at some stage I could still feel the pain - though I can't remember the years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a> But even here, last year I was admitted again in the hospital.  It was something like two weeks, it was concerning my operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you still remember the name of the Doctor who was examining you in hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> That Doctor, I can't remember, I think it is something like Barnard, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> But Mr Rubushe, you said you went to Lloyd police station to place a claim concerning a shooting.  Can you</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>7 W RUBUSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>tell us Mr Rubushe, what happened at Lloyd police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> When I went there, they asked me a question who shot me, I said it is soldiers.  They asked me the name of the soldier, I told them that I don't know the name of the soldier.  They said they won't take the case because I don't know the name of the person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> If I hear you clearly, you said you were not - just because of the fact that you did not know the name of the soldier who shot you, no attention was paid to you claim?  Was there anything that, maybe you, did you ever approach any lawyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were there any people who saw you when you were shot, when you were being shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> Yes, I can say because there are people who took me and one of my neighbours once told me the story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What did he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> He said he saw me while I was being shot by the soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> At the police station, do you still remember the name of the police that you were going to who said he is not going to attend to this case of yours, because you don't know the name of the soldier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> No, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you ever go to the police station again or maybe you didn't go there after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> Yes, I tried to go to Fleet Street, I tried to institute another claim again.  Even there, I was not attended to, just because I didn't know the name of the person who shot me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you go to Fifth Street police station on the</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>8 W RUBUSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>very same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> No, I didn't, I think after a few weeks I went there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Whom did you approach at Fleet Street police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> It was a White man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What did he say as a response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> He also asked the very same question that who shot me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> By the time you were there, were there any other people who used to go to the police station concerning the very same problems just because they don't know the name of the police and they were not attended to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> I don't know, I won't say, but to me that's what I was told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Mr Rubushe, can you go on with your evidence?  Is there anything else that you would like to say, anything else that you would like to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> The other thing that I would like to add is this, although I was shot by this person whom that I don't even know, at least something must be done to try and find a reason for this to find this person who shot at me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> As far as you know, what do you think that might be the reason, what do you think that might be the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> No, I don't know anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Are there any incidents that took place in that particular place where you were shot at, maybe a conflict between the soldiers and the residents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> No, there was nothing in that place, nothing happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> In conclusion Mr Rubushe, what are your requests</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>

<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">W RUBUSHE:</span> I think it was in 1993, 1994.</p>

<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Let's start on the day of the 15th of August 1985 as you said in your statement.  By the way you said on this particular day it was after the houses were burnt and some other places here in Duncan Village, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">M DE V SUKWANA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Can you tell us Mr Sukwana freely what happened on that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">M DE V SUKWANA:</span> Yes.  On the 15th it was midnight, it was midnight, I heard someone kicking the door.  It was White men who were in the company of Siphiwo Jamjam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a> When I tried to tell my mother that she must know that I'm being arrested, the Whites took me to the hippo.  They said I must lie there because some of the comrades were already there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a> We left because these people had a list.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You say here in this hippo there were some other people who were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">M DE V SUKWANA:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were those people young people or maybe people who were at an age?</p>

<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">M DE V SUKWANA:</span> Yes, they didn't get the people, they took us to the police station.  When I was at the police station, they said I must take off my clothes and they electrocuted my private parts with electric shots and they hit my underneath my feet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a> After that they asked me about the organisations, political organisations that I was involved in.  I told them that I was a member of ELYO.  They locked me up in the cell and after that they took me to the courts and from the court we were taken to Westbank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a> When we arrived at Westbank, the police ordered us to take off our clothes.  They were hitting us with batons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Let's go back a little bit Mr Sukwana.  At the police station, do you still remember the policeman who were harassing you and torturing you and assaulting you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">M DE V SUKWANA:</span> No, I can't remember, because they didn't have their name tags on.</p>

<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a> He was hitting us.  If there is no sort of echo, he'll say that he's not counting that lash and then he'll start afresh hitting us again.</p>

<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you Mr Rubushe and Mr Silwana.  We thank you for this testimony trying to reveal to us things that happened during the Duncan Village massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a> But I would like to make a request to the people at large.  There is this name Nkunzemnyama, but we are not able to use this name, because it is not the real name of a person.  If ever there is somebody else here at Duncan Village who has some knowledge of this Nkunzemnyama's real name, we would like to get that - there's one there who's - who knows him.  Can you please see us during the break because the aim of this Commission is to go to those people who did these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a> Reconciliation is not going to be - we are not going to have reconciliation not until we meet those people and for them to come forward and they must also be here with the victims also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a> So this Nkunzemnyama's name is, we hear this Nkunzemnyama's name for the forth time.  We would like to know his real name to get his true identity so that we can go to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a> Thank you very much, you can go back to your places.</p>
