We are waiting for the witnesses.  Seemingly they aren't here.  The only witness which is around is Mr Buthelezi, and that's why we're still waiting.

That's where they can be seated.  If you are here and you want to give in your statement you can go there so that you can give your statement, and then come back and sit down and listen to the witnesses who've already gave their statements.  Thank you.  We came to a conclusion that we will go for a tea, and then when we come back we don't have to go for a tea until lunch time.  We're trying to save time because we've wasted time already.  Then we will go for a tea now, and then we will go on - after the tea we will go on until lunch time, until 1 o'clock.  We all agree that this is the best solution we can come up with.  It's better that we go for a tea.  It's now 10 to 10.  I hope that at about 10 past 10 we will come back, or five past 10 we will be back, and then we will continue from there until 1 o'clock, until lunch time.    As we've apologised yesterday that the tea has been prepared for the witnesses and their families.  The tea has been prepared for the witnesses and their families and the TRC staff members, and those who are here to help, like the counsellors and the briefers.

We know our places are far apart, and we don't have our private transport, we rely largely on the public transport.  I would like to apologise on that note.  We have already started late and therefore we won't adjourn for tea break, we will only adjourn for lunch.  I am sure this will suit all of us.\nThere is one aspect that we would like to pay attention to.  We would ask for each and every one of you in this hall to pay full attention, listen properly to the names, to the areas which they refer to, so that when we leave this place we do not at all distort any message.  Yesterday it has so happened that one of the witnesses who came up to render his or her testimony, and at the time one name was implicated, Siphiwe Nxumalo, and it happened that that very name was similar to the name of one of our prominent figures here in Mondlo, and he got a telephone call that his name was implicated at the Commission by one of the witnesses who was rendering his or her testimony.  He was very offended.  I am sure you understand that when you receive anonymous calls one gets offended.  Fortunately we managed to sort that one out.  We managed to locate the person who took the message to Siphiwe, and we had to rectify that error and we were able to.  The Siphiwe that was referred to is not the one of Mondlo.  Please pay full attention, and if there is anything that you do not understand at all do not go around and say your own version and give a fabricated one.  Please pay attention to names and attention to details at the same time that you may not distort any message and give a fabricated version.\nWithout much waste of time we will call upon our first witness to come up and occupy the witness stand by the name of Harriet Jabulile Mcetywa.\n/CHAIRPERSON",

            "  When we got to Pongola - I was born in Soweto, and we left with my husband to Pongola, and that's where we built our home.  We were there and the situation was stable, and after violence had erupted now chaos started.  From there my husband was being hunted by the boers, white policemen, and boers from Piet Retief, Mahamba and Pongola were after my husband.  We never had a pleasant stay at all.  He was working at a cotton firm where he was a manager, and he resigned and started our own business.  Because of the harassment due to the boers ... (intervention) Please just stop for one second.  Sorry, we ... (inaudible) ... because what you're saying has to be translated ... (inaudible) ... now if I can just take you back quickly.  You said that this violence erupted.  What violence was this and why did it erupt?   ---   This violence was caused by him, because he is the one who started the ANC in the area, and the area was predominantly IFP.  And from there we experienced harsh life, and boers will come and raid our home, searching for weapons.  And from there he was being followed by the boers, and the boers were forever after him, and therefore the customers, our customers, were affected.  They could not come to our saloon, because we were owning a business saloon.  In November 1993 there were rumours that he was going to be killed, and he was no longer free at all from that time.  And one time when he was in town one man approached him and took a picture of him.  He got back home very worried about that action, because the person who took the picture of him ran away soon after that.  After a few days being harassed, and police searching our home now and again, and scared for our lives, on the 20th, 1993, November, one person who was working hand in hand with him as a secretary came to our home to tell us that some men came to the business and told her that they were looking for my husband and he will be killed.  And we were frightened in that fashion often, and on the 5th - I am sorry, on the 19th November he went to visit the children in Swaziland.  He felt so much in miss of them, and he went to Swaziland and back on Sunday.  And the bus strike erupted and there was a bus boycott, and it was alleged that he was the one behind that.  And they alleged as well that it was ANC behind that.  I told him that maybe we should go back home in Johannesburg because we are not at all at peace here, and he refused to listen to me.  We continued living in this area.  On the 20th November 1993 Krish Ndwandwe arrived, and he was relating his own story as well that there were people trying to attack him, and he went to town.  No, they both went to town with Krish's wife as well, and when they got to town they left him at Ellerine's Furniture shop, only to find that the attacker was there, the perpetrator, following him.  After a short distance he stopped to talk to someone there, and the killer came behind him.  And he looked back and saw this man, and suddenly he shot, and shot the second time, and my husband fell right then.  He was shot 10 times.  That wasn't the end of the story.  After that I saw a crowd of people running, coming to my house, and yet in the morning he had told me that he wasn't feeling so well, he was feeling depressed.  And when he left, going now by the gate, he stopped and waved at me, and little did I know that that was the last wave.  I went to town, because I saw people running, coming to my house, and I was surprised what was happening.  I wasn't too sure what was happening, and I didn't know that that was the time when he will die.  I saw a crowd of people coming to my house, and they got in.  I asked what had happened.  No one responded, but they told me that something of this sort has happened.  I left, I went to town, and he was lying down dead, and the boers refused me to come anywhere close to him.  He was shot at 11 in the morning right in front of the Protea Furniture shop's personnel.  I couldn't come any closer to get close to him.  I went back home and there was a crowd of people in my premises.  I didn't know what to do.  At about 11 - no, at 11 he was shot, and was left like that up until 6.00 pm.  In the afternoon I tried to go to the police station, the mortuary, but still they refused me.  And after that I consulted the family to let them know of the tragedy.  From that point we - he died on Monday, and on Wednesday there were Comrades all over singing, and there was a white policeman that drove by and shot at the Comrades using rubber bullets.  At that time some of my relatives had already arrived, but not all of them, and they took two of those Comrades who were shot by the police.  It was on Wednesday the 23rd.  The two Comrades were taken to Juba Hospital and were given preliminary treatment.  We made preparations for the funeral, and there were rumours that he was going to be burned, his corpse will be burned and won't be buried the proper way, the right way.  Before the funeral IFP people slaughtered cattle in town, and were so excited about his death, but I did say that God is alive, and one day it will hit back on them.  We went on ahead with the funeral preparations, and people were not so free to come to my house to help us as we were preparing for the funeral.  However, some did come.  On Saturday at about nine I asked the ANC people, Senzo Mchunu, to provide security because I did anticipate trouble on that day.  On Saturday security indeed arrived, and they only had one gun.  And at the same time the relatives and the neighbours were busy peeling the vegetables, preparing lunch for that day, and there were a few men who came in wearing jackets, and there were five of them.  They shot people, and people - some of them ran away.  And there was a police vehicle parked by, and what amazed us was that the vehicle took off before the shooting spree, and got back after that.  I still thanked my God because no one died on that day.  After that the station commander of Pongola Police Station, Meiring, came and was complimenting us about the house, our beautiful house we have.  And I was worried and concerned about the safety of the people outside, but he wasn't worried about the safety of the people, which was a cause for concern.  Nothing happened anyways.  On Sunday morning - because I decided that as early as eight we will have the funeral so people will be free to leave earlier -we saw three people approaching to our house, coming from a forest, and they were driving a Ford Sierra with registration NO.  And that car was driving up and down, threatening to shoot, and there were helicopters and soldiers patrolling the area and fortunately they were arrested, those guys.  We therefore went on with our funeral arrangements and we buried my husband.  Relatives left and went back to their respective places and I remained with my children and with the three of us.",

When we were in court - we arrived there, and I had no one accompanying me because people were scared to accompany me, they feared their lives, and they thought that they were going to be killed because I was known as a woman of ANC.  I was with my daughter, my first-born, who is 17 now.  We arrived there and we found Inkatha people inside the court.  Most people in there were Inkatha people, and they refused that ANC people should go inside.  I was the only one allowed.  Inside people were swearing at me.  The case was remanded.  I left the court.  There were Comrades outside the court, they were waiting there in cars, and there were also buses full of Inkatha members.  There were many.  There were buses from Dumbe, and vans.  Outside the court one person known as Zanda Hlangamandla came to me, and then he spit at my face and he pointed his finger at me.  I went back to the court because I was scared.  Police were just watching and doing nothing.  One white policeman came and he helped me.  He pushed these people and I went to my car.  I drove back home.  It was on the 4th of March.  It was about 10 o'clock.  I decided to drive down to Swaziland to bring my children's clothes.  I didn't sleep in Swaziland, I came back.  At about 9 o'clock in border gate in Golela I phoned the security, I asked them how was it in the township, and they told me the situation was bad, I must be careful.  God protected me until home.  I parked my car in the garage.  I went inside my bathroom and then I took a bath.  After I finished taking a bath I served the guys I was staying with, I gave them food.  One of them noticed me that I was troubled, and we all knew that Themba Khoza has just passed next to my house and pointed at my house.  He was together with other IFP members.  When I was inside my house these guys said to me, \"Sister Jabu, you mustn't go outside.  Outside the situation is real bad.\"  Police cars were outside from Pongola Police Station, and kombis, about eight of them, with soldiers, Shangani soldiers, and boers, and Inkatha members as well.  They were in uniform.  I took a pillow, I went to my sitting-room.  That's where I slept on my couch.  I fell asleep and I heard a knock at the kitchen door.  When I heard this knock these guys told me I mustn't go outside because the situation was real bad, and all these people who came by kombis were surrounding my house.  I went back to the lounge and they told me to turn off the lights.  I turned off the lights and it was dark.  Sbu Shandu got up the tree, climbed the tree, and the other one went and stood next to the bedroom, the other one next to the garage.  When I was still lying on my couch I heard a gunfire hitting the front door.  I got scared.  I stood up.  A big hole at that door.  I went to the bedroom, I took a telephone and I made a call to the police, and the police told me there are no cars.   That's because they were the ones who were surrounding my house.  I heard gunfire.  It was the guys whom I was staying with and the policemen.  The gunfire went on until 4.00 am.  Other shots were coming through the windows at my house.  I lay down on my stomach and then they started throwing hand grenades inside my house.  I saw a fire from the sitting-room and the dining-room, and then they went inside my child's bedroom.  The house was on fire and I was inside the house, I couldn't run outside.  I went to the main bedroom, I opened the wardrobe, I got inside.  I heard footsteps and I could tell that they were coming towards the bedroom.  There was a smoke, fire, I was dizzy.  I couldn't do anything.  And outside gunfire were still on.  These guys were shooting the police and the police were shooting them.  One policeman got injured, a black policeman.  His name was Ndlovu.  He is at Pongola Police Station.  I went to the kitchen.  I was trying to get out because I was scared that even if I am inside I am going to be burnt by the fire.  When I got outside they heard that the door was being opened.  They fired at the door.  I went to the refrigerator, next to the refrigerator.  I could smell the gas from the refrigerator, and I suspected that it was going to explode.  I went outside.  When I was outside I was shot and God helped me, protected me, because I didn't get injured.  I went to a neighbour's house.  Outside my neighbour's house I hide myself on the grass.  They tried to look for me, they couldn't find me.  Before all these things happened I took my car keys with me inside my gown pocket.  People stopped me in the morning to go inside my house, but I refused, I went on, I checked my house.  They also burnt my saloon, my business, and it was the only income I was depending on.  And what I had in the saloon, the stock was about amounting to R10 000,00.  I found a tape in the yard, and boers were inside my house.  They were about 20 of them.  They refused me to go inside my house, so I told them, \"I am going to get inside my house.  This is my house.\"  No one answered me.  Senzo Mchunu came together with security from Empangeni.  He talked with these boers, and my house was burnt and everything inside my house was damaged.  I was left with the gown I was wearing.  I asked them to accompany me to the bank so that I withdraw some money and buy something to wear.  I decided to go back to Johannesburg.  I went back to Johannesburg.  After that these security guys stayed there in my house.  When I was in Johannesburg I heard that they wanted to exhume my husband's body, and I tried to talk to these security guys to make sure that they don't do that.  I stayed at home in 1994 after I left, because I left in 1994 April.  I went back to Pongola again after they burnt my house because I couldn't stay nice in Johannesburg.  My heart was back in Pongola.  I decided to go back to Pongola.  I reported the matter to Senzo.  I asked them to look for a place for me to stay.  Then I decided to renovate two rooms of my house.  I renovated that two rooms.  One lawyer from Pongola, his name is Plant, he helped me.  He bought paint and doors for me.  I stayed there with my kids.  Elections came and I was chosen as a councillor.  After that what happened last year in December, the Truth Commission people came to take a statement.  SABC people came to interview me about the violence in the area, because I was one of the members of the ANC there.  After that I got threats that I was going to be shot and follow my husband, and even my children they still experience harassment from Inkatha Youth, and they still tell them that, \"Who killed your father?  You will follow your father.\"  And this thing is really tormenting my children.  Even today they aren't in a good situation.  In December I went to Jozini.  A 4x4, a certain 4x4, powder blue in colour, followed me, and then it overtaken me.  I slowed down.  It followed me until Jozini.  At Jozini I drove to those people I was supposed to drop there.  I was suspecting this 4x4.  I went to the police station in Jozini.  I noticed this van, and luckily enough when I went to make a call these people were coming to my direction, but the phones were not working so I couldn't make a phone call.  Then I left.  This very same 4x4 followed me, so they knew I was going to go back to Pongola.  There's only one route from Jozini to Pongola.  They followed me again, they tried to shoot me.  They couldn't shoot me, they just shot my car.  I accelerated.  When I got into the T-junction I found a red car standing parked there and I couldn't overtake it, but I tried my best, so I accelerated.  When I got into the town I checked my car.  I made a call to Durban to the ANC offices in Durban.  I couldn't get any assistance.  I was staying there unsafe.  I continued staying under those difficult conditions, and then I decided to stay there and die there with my children.  In December a certain guy, IFP member, was killed, and I wasn't there.  When I came back I heard that there was a guy who was killed, an IFP member.  So I stayed there, I didn't want to run back to Johannesburg.  I said I was tired of running away.  I was tired of sleeping in hotels, and I have been reporting all these matters to my own organisation, to other people, and I can't get any assistance, so I decided that I will rather die here.  One night I was sleeping with my children.  A kombi got there and they started firing.  We woke up, me and my children.  I took my children, I actually threw them out the window, and I saw the kombi driving back.  And I took clothes and I took them to the boot of my car and then I drove back to Johannesburg.  I reported this as well to my organisation, but there was no assistance.",

One of my uncles has a wedding band, and he plays that band, and that band plays for different weddings, and we were in this very hall in that night on Friday.  That was Friday evening on the 13th March 1994.  It was about 2.00 to 3.00 am and we left, we went to Mondlo.  I slept in the car.  I didn't get inside the house and I didn't even go home.  We were at my uncle's place or area.  Around eight in the morning I had to leave after I have packed the instruments of the band.  I was an observer of the ANC.",

            "  It so happened that on that day, on the 13th in the morning around eight, I left my uncle's place and went home after offloading the instruments.  When I got to this section at B I saw a crowd of people coming from Mlaba, approaching to the new supermarket at B Section.  There was a flag, an IFP flag, hanging, and I did not pay any attention to that because I knew that different organisations would have general meetings and rallies and marches.  So that didn't bother me at all.  I went on ahead, I went to my house, and when I got home the first thing I heard was that I should leave and - leave completely Mondlo, the area.  It wasn't as easy as that for me to leave the area because I had no place to run to and to go to to seek refuge.  Now, that group went to section A, and there was an ANC office that had just been opened in March.  That was the office that we are going to support in campaigning.  We could not campaign with Vryheid branch, we had to campaign on our own as uMondlo group.  As I was home hardly 30 minutes I heard that the ANC office had been destroyed by IFP members.  We left with my brother, Moli, who was the treasurer of the youth organisation, and tried to go and see as to what happened and find out the details.  We didn't have any weapons with us at that time, we were just going there.  The first thing we got from the group that was running from A to B, section A to B, was that the IFP group intended to kill every boy, and they alleged that they were born of bitches.  The first boy who was killed was found at a corner by a super.  They shoved the spears through.  I am sorry, I don't know the name of the boy.  He was 14 years old.  They carried on killing people at that time until we met, the five of us.  It was myself, Moli Mkwanazi, Vusi Khumalo, Victor Mdlalose and Phumzile Dlamini.  We gathered at some place next to the office that we had just opened in uMondlo, started operating in.  We saw a police vehicle approaching with police inside.  At that time the IFP group was marching along the street heading to the church.  When they got to us they said they will only give us five minutes, and after five minutes had lapsed we should disperse, and after that they will shoot.  And they did shoot, and we ran to Mseleku's building at the store.  That's where we hid.  The police vehicle drove on ahead.  ",

            " No.  Then the IFP group went back, making a U-turn by Lutheran Church.  There was a funeral from Bekkersdal, and the IFP member was to be buried in uMondlo.  We had heard  that that was coming, and two buses arrived and had supporters of IFP from Bekkersdal.  What I will say is that those who were taking the forefront in the whole thing were the members in uMondlo.  IFP went back to where the funeral was and took the casket and they went to bury their member. ",

            "  Maybe I should go back and say we had heard that a member of IFP who was shot in Bekkersdal, residing at a hotel, will be buried.  He was an IFP member, and I wouldn't know the details of the shooting and so forth.  And also we heard from the people who would come and contact us that they were harassed at night, Friday night.  There was a shooting spree in uMondlo streets.  The funeral went on ahead, and after that, the IFP funeral, now they started calling us names.  The person who was in the forefront was Jerome Buthelezi.  And one other that I would like to disclose his name although I did not make mention of his name in the statement is Nkomondo.  I don't know his role in the IFP, however the leaders of IFP then were Jerome Buthelezi and Nkomondo.  We did try to monitor the situation, and they went to bury and they carried their member to the graveside, and they had with them spears.  And we tried to hide and keep a distance from them, about 900 metres away from them, and we were following them.  There were those who had black guns, and one had a sack full of guns, and there was a police vehicle following them at the same time.  Inside there was Mr Mdluli, the assistant of Mondlo station commander.  They were free and they went on ahead and carried their member to the graveside.  They stopped at Mondlo in a gas station.  That's where they started attacking us in public, and others were happy about that action, IFP attacking us.  The police were watching and doing nothing to rescue us.  After we had tried to run away we got to the riverside and we found there was an ANC group still there awaiting.  We ran back and got to the post office, and we saw a police vehicle, green in colour, and they started shooting at us for no apparent reason.  They never said a thing, but they started shooting.  And we tried another route.  We ran through Inanda and we got section B.  I am sorry, on our way to B we saw a house that was burning.  At A section when you pass Super Garage there was a house whose owner was with them, their supporter.  We found out that the house that was being occupied by ANC Comrades who were destitute, were the ANC members, and they did not have any place so they had to go to Mondlo and occupy houses there as ANC members.  And one other member who was killed was Mike Mthethwa.  We ran and we got to B section, and in the afternoon we gathered as the youth of ANC and we headed to our office, which was destroyed at the time, and we said, \"Better still we should be killed jointly like this,\" because we didn't know who was behind this, whether ZP or IFP.  Now we were chanting our songs and singing our freedom songs and five vans came.  I won't disclose one of the police names, but there was a supervisor with them who said, \"Let them be shot.\"  They started shooting indeed, and there was a van that was driving behind me as I was running away, and they tried to shoot, and I was shot right on my right hand - no, on my left hand, by these people in the van.  This is when I was shot as I was trying to escape, trying to jump the fence, the wall fence.  As I managed to jump I fell down on the other side now.  ",

From what IFP was doing at Mondlo in that time there were sergeants that came to take statements about what was happening in uMondlo, and the City Press members, who took statements.  And they took all of that to the Mondlo Police Station, but after that there were rumours that I was an informer, police informer.  And one of the persons who was saying that, those rumours, I know him, he's a police, and I know his name.  The following day on Monday I was standing by the office in uMondlo and the police approached uMondlo, KwaZulu Police, and they were pointing guns at me and said I should get into the car.  And I asked them as to where they were taking me to and they said I have with me a weapon, an axe, so I should get into the car.  Yes, I did get into the car and we went to Mondlo Police Station.  I asked the station commander, Mr Mxinga.  Mr Mxinga did come to me with Mr Ndlovu, and I asked them as to why I was arrested, why were they arresting me.  They said this was due to the axe that I had.  I asked Mr Mdluli that the previous day we were together monitoring the IFP funeral, \"And before you there were two boys who carried black guns, with axes as well.  Did you arrest those or did you bother yourself to ask them as to why they had those things in their possession?  But you did not.  However, you do find it easy to ask me.  Is it because I am not an IFP?\"  He did not respond.  Shortly after that Mr Thompkin arrived, who was a member of a police committee, and there was a meeting that convened as well with the IFP followers, and ANC followers were present in the meeting.  And Mr Thompkin wanted to know why and what was the problem of what was happening, but it was said that I have kept hostage of the IFP members in the ANC office.  And I repudiated all of that.",

At about seven I was outside.  I saw a big green police vehicle, followed by a van, and they parked in front of the house and the Stability Unit, the police, got out and they were wearing copper hats.  We could not see their faces, their faces were covered.  We were many in the yard, but we kept quiet and we watched as to what was going to be done by the Stability Unit.  They asked for Bongani Buthelezi and they also asked for the guns.  And I told them I am the one, and there were no questions thereafter.  Suddenly I was assaulted, and they were using guns assaulting me, and I fell down and four boys were taken.  There at home we're quite numerous, and they took four boys with me into the van, police van.  And at the back there were people in police uniforms, but they had covered their faces.  I could not tell who were they.  And they had knives, Okapis, right inside the police van.  From the time it left my home it went to Hulyard(?) and they were assaulting me, stabbing me.  I was confused because I told myself that I am with the police but all of this occurred still.  And let me back-track, let me also say something about when I was still at home.  They asked for weapons, guns, and also they asked for bombs.  They searched the whole house and the whole yard outside, but they could gain anything.  And one police came with a plastic full of petrol bombs and asked me as to who those petrol bombs were and belonged.  I said I did not know, and we asked him where did he get those bombs and he started assaulting us for asking merely why and where were the bombs coming from.  I was taken and they alleged that the petrol bombs belonged to me.  They took me into the van, and that's when they were assaulting me, as they were assaulting me and crying, shouting that, \"You are hurting me,\" and they said - they gave me some beer and they said I should use that as medication.  And lo and behold that was not beer, it was petrol.  And I was still saying to them, \"I am hurt,\" and please they should leave me alone.  And they kept - and they were adamant, saying, \"This is medication,\" and that was petrol that they were giving me.  They were using spears in the van, assaulting me.

As for your injuries and as for your health, there is nothing much that we may promise you now, but there is little that we could offer you, maybe like seeing if you could be taken to hospital in one way or the other, especially that your hands have been strongly affected, you can't lose them and lift any heavy things.

It's painful to realise that there is no respect in the community, and again what befell you, anyone could be the victim of the same fate that befell you in this community, as you have lost your two sons on top of the rest that happened to you.  And one other aspect that's painful is the fact that we keep on hearing the fact that police were present and could not provide any security or safety for you.  And some other times we do hear that police took part in these incidents.  But we do trust and hope, and we have this hope, that in the future the situation will get better, and an effort is being put to reconcile and tie the past with the future.  What we'll advise you about is that we will compile a report here as the Commission and forward it, as the other statements that will be forwarded to the President, and the President will see that people like you receive attention.  It looks like the children have suffered this ordeal, and we would advise you to get in touch with the counsellors present here and see if the children won't receive any psychological help.  Perhaps all this - we could attribute all of this suffering to what you suffered.  We do trust and hope that you'll be safe, and we thank you.",

The parents of the children that were injured in this incident the chief has just related.  You may be seated.  We realise that you are hurt inside, and we await the time when your wounds will be healed.  And we know that as the chief was relating you were taken back in time when all this happened, and also we'd like to thank you now for coming here, knowing very well that your story is part and parcel of what the chief has related, and you were still brave enough to be here and listen to the chief, and also give the chief the moral support which he needed the most as he rendered his testimony.  We do believe that the Lord will be by your side and the wounds will be healed in no time, and we trust that even you will be able - or will plan to meet the counsellors, the Truth Commission counsellors that we'll also leave here in Vryheid.  We do believe that you will be helped by getting in touch with them, and God will bless you.\nBefore we adjourn for lunch we have a few announcements here.  On the 12th May, next month - we refer to next month - in Mondlo location we will be having statement-takers who will be taking statements.

It so happened that people were relaxed, but they were not so relaxed because some people lost family members.  There was peace though, even though people couldn't see eye to eye.  It so happened that in 1991 in January my child came from Johannesburg.  His name was Busanangu.  I left home at about 11 o'clock, accompanying him to the station - bus stop.  As we were heading towards the bus stop he boarded a taxi - or a bus.  I returned back home.  After my son had boarded the bus, as I was heading home, a certain car came belonging to Mr Ngwenya.  There were five of them inside that car, and then I told myself, \"Oh, there's a car,\" and I realised that it was Mr Ngwenya's car.  He got off from his car and he opened the door for these four other people who were also inside the car.  And then Mr Ngwenya said to me, \"Ntshangase, here are these people,\" and I got confused and then I approached them.  As I was approaching them one guy pointed a gun at me.  He was from behind that car.  And then I was still surprised and they started firing.  One bullet shot got into my hand and the other one into my jaw.  And Mr Ngwenya was now inside his car, at the back of his car.  He knew all these people and he knew their mission.  A second man came from the front of the car.  He shot at me.  And then I kept on approaching them, and I held an umbrella in my hand.  And then they shot at Mr Ngwenya's car.  Four bullets got into Mr Ngwenya's car.  And then this guy chased them away, and they got into a kombi and then they drove off.  And Mr Ngwenya took us to hospital.   I didn't know these people.  I didn't know them at all.  In hospital they referred me to Ngwelezana Hospital because the doctors from the first hospital said they couldn't help me.  So also in Ngwelezana they referred me to King Edward.  I was admitted there for two months.  They stitched my jaws.  I couldn't eat.  I was drinking amahewu.  I got better and I was discharged, I went back home.  I arrived home on Monday.  When I got home - on Wednesday I was supposed to go back to King Edward - I heard that Mr Ngwenya had been killed.  He had been shot dead.  I went back to hospital.  I was treated and they told me I should come for check ups.  I went back home.  Police came to my house, and they had names of the people who shot at me.  They told me that \"The people who shot you were Jabulani Manana, Elliot Mkwanazi.\"  And then I asked the police what was the reason.  The police told me, \"We don't know.\"  We went to court, to Piet Retief Court, and the case was remanded.  It was still in 1991.  I think it was somewhere in May.  The case was remanded to the 5th of June.  We went back.  After the 5th of May I got back home and there was no one who came back to me to explain, and I saw a policeman who took the statement from me.  I asked the police, \"What happened?  How come I am not hearing anything about this case?\"  The police told me, \"I was in Soweto.\"  I asked the police, \"If you are in Soweto you took all the papers or the statements with you?\"  The police said, \"No, I left them with other police.\"  So I asked the police, \"How come because there was no one who came back to me and told me as to when the case was going to be heard?\"   And later I learnt that the case had been heard and I wasn't supposed to be told about it.  And there were lawyers there, and then I wanted to found out as to what was going to happen to me.  I couldn't get any assistance and I was delayed that I came before the Commission today.  I think I've got a chance.  Maybe you can help me with this regard.",

I am a child of God, I am a brethren.  At night I couldn't sleep peacefully because I had heard threats from people that my husband was in danger.  In 1987 - I am sorry, in 1988 he left for Lusaka to meet ANC.  That was before the ANC was unbanned, and he met the members of ANC and he was with the people of Contralesa.  And when he got back that was known, and I was told that it was not acceptable what my husband was doing and into.  I got a number of threats at work.  It was in 1989.  I was so scared.  And in 1990 people boycotted, and I could see danger facing my children.  I told my husband, and I was adamant, saying, \"I know IFP very well.  Please withdraw.\"  He nevertheless went on, and I could see that my stay and everything wasn't safe.  I therefore decided to sell some of my businesses and we flee.  We left for Johannesburg, and my boys were attending high school.  When I got to Johannesburg we bought a house in a boer suburb, and the boers came and stole money, close to R1 million, because at the time the boers were very racist and could not accept any black person living around their suburbs.  We got back.  I left my husband in Johannesburg and decided to go back to Nquthu, and I deemed it fit for him to just remain and I will leave and go back.  Although I withdrew from Inkatha I have nothing against them, and they are no things that I do behind Inkatha's back, so I will go back to Nquthu.",

            "  That is correct.  There were some other properties that I never sold, and I used the supermarket, the small supermarket.  It was no longer a big supermarket.  And the fried chicken outlet and the filling station, as well as the restaurant where people will sit and dine in Nquthu, that's what was left.  It went on.  Please forgive me in case I make a mistake here.  There were papers that were distributed in Nquthu that Winnie Mandela and Peter Mokaba will come and address in Nquthu, you know the prominent figures of ANC.  I said to myself, \"Oh my goodness, if my husband sees these papers Inkatha will kill me.\"  He was the one arranging for the arrival of Winnie Mandela and Peter Mokaba, and it was bad, the situation was bad then.  Some did not believe that I am not an ANC member.  We were sort of harassed.  People will come around to my house, and at the same time I wasn't at peace.  I was forever alert of any situation that was happening, awaiting for my husband's return.  There was this incident when Kizwe shot at Molefe's and 11 of them were shot.  On that very day when Molefe's child was shot I was going to church in the morning.  When we were approaching the corner next to Nquthu Hospital I saw the fellow church members.  I do believe that God Almighty overcomes everything.  I said to myself, \"Well, they should join us, these other fellow members, church members.\"  We gave them a ride to church, and in front there was a kombi awaiting to shoot at us, a yellow kombi, and the boy who was going to shoot at us was standing right outside the kombi.  I left, pleading with my husband not to get off the car.  Maybe I should drive the vehicle because they wouldn't shoot me.  We went to church that day, on that day that Molefe's children were killed, the 11 boys were shot.  My husband took part in the preparation of the funeral.  That's what reinforced the whole thing, and I could see that I will never have a peaceful stay here.  From then I took my children with, because they will come for holidays, and went to Dundee.  That's where I bought a house.  No, I rented a house from an Indian man.  I occupied that house, suffering of course, tremendously so.  In 1994 - I went to Dundee in 1993 with my children, struggling, trying to hide every time, praying to God Almighty to protect us and keep us on His might hand.  One time in the morning we went to church.  We found out people are waiting for us along the roadside.  And one time I told my husband not to go to church, I will go to church, and he said he wouldn't afford not to go to church.  I pleaded with him that there are ANC members at the stadium together with one man who was Harry Gwala as well.  I told him not to go to church but to go to the stadium.  On that very day when I got to church at 12, when my husband had to preach, I preached on his behalf.  And I saw the brethren looking back at the door, and the kombi came full of the boys with guns, ready to shoot at us.  And I pleaded with the church members that we should pray, and I thanked God because they gave up, they never shot us.  On that day I found those boys who were intending to shoot us with Chief Ngobese.  They were standing with Chief Ngobese talking to him.  Chief Ngobese - I had nothing against Chief Ngobese, but he had a problem with my husband and as a result of that that affected my relationship with him as well. Just before you continue, there was something you mentioned in your statement which you've left out here, and that was about an attack on your house in 1993 after a big meeting at Nquthu.   ---   Oh yes, I remember that.  I omitted that.  Yes, there was a meeting and was addressed by Gideon Zulu.  After that people ran to the store, and we tried to close the store but they were forcing to gain entry into the store, and that's when I realised how great God is, because they threw eight bombs right inside the store and not even one blasted.  They took money, they filled their vehicles with petrol for free of charge, and I refused my husband to come to Nquthu.  But as a man he would insist and be adamant that he will do what he wants to do.  On that day the meeting was Nqabenyeni - the meeting.  Those who attended said there was a child who said there are people who have just arrived.  Gideon Zulu said that, and people ran and flee from the hall to the store in an attempt to kill us, but thanks God because they never managed.",

Even coming here I had to get ride from people.  I have lost entirely everything.  I was black-listed in the community, and I am black-listed as well.  I can't do anything.  Today Nquthu is back on its feet, but I am still suffering the ordeal.  But thank God that not even one died in my family.  I don't even know how that happened.  That's a miracle.  We went to Dundee and opened a shop.  They threw bombs in the other store but nothing happened.  When I got to Dundee I opened a shop.  That's where they will come, the police I mean, using ZP1271, looking for my husband, intending to shoot my husband right in the store.  I will stand and look at them timidly, and they will surround my husband intending to shoot him.  I reported it in every aspect of this matter to the police.  I tried even to get the workers, the employees, to report their own version to the police station, but to no avail.  One day when I was in Dundee on the 29th of December 1993, it was about three in the afternoon, I received a call from the ladies in the shop, the employees.  The IFP people attacked us and wanted us to get out of the store, but Khoza came in to our rescue.  He is the one who came to our rescue.  He was with Buthelezi.  I left, I went to the store, and I saw that the store was closed already.  I prayed, didn't know what to do, and I pleaded with them to go back to work as well.  They refused, and all ended on that note.  I would try my best to sell so I could be able to support my family and pay my rent in Dundee, but to no avail.",

He didn't observe that.  They attacked him and stoned him, and then stabbed him with a spear.  He fell down.  That was it.  I could not see because I was at hospital by then.  I heard this from the children, who told me that my husband was stabbed by a spear that killed him.  At the hospital they came to my place.  They took our livestock, cows, and the furniture in the house.  They broke the windows.  They burned everything and took almost everything that we had in the house.  We didn't even have anything to bury him in.  Even the cows were taken.  I was left desolate.  I even asked a blanket to wrap him with from Agrippa Molefe's family.  Beforehand his brother, Jomo, arrived at home.  I thought he was going to assist, but I said to him let us go carrying our identity documents together down there.  However, I didn't know what his intentions were.  When he was killed by Inkatha it was because he refused to go there because Job wanted to seek assistance for him.  I am referring to my husband.  He didn't go there.  Maybe he could be alive by now.  Inkatha was from the direction of Nkande, then he was proved to go there to get assistance.  He refused and took his own way.",

And the mosquitoes in my house - or the area was infested with mosquitoes, which were troublesome to these children, and my son wasn't there, he was in town where he was selling.  In the afternoon the following day I heard that in Haladu the situation is not stable, and the message got to Mhlongo's house claiming that the situation is not stable at all at Haladu, and we therefore decided to go back to Haladu to see what was happening.  And my son wasn't there at the time, he was with the mother of the two children.  When we got there we did not find the people we wanted to see, and we found an old lady who told us that yes, it was bad, the situation was getting volatile.  And we heard from this man, who was telling us that, \"Mbuthu's boy was killed.  We don't know whether this Mbuthu boy is the one who was working in town.\"  And I could feel that I am losing strength as I suspected that that was my son.  We did not know exactly as to who was killed, because he used to travel in a 5 o'clock bus coming back home, and it had become a custom that we expect him around five.  And when five lapsed my daughter-in-law went to find out if he was coming or getting off the bus, but to no avail.  And I got worried, continuously so, especially that I had heard already that Mbuthu's son had died in Haladu.  I therefore decided to go to Mhlangeni, where I could receive my pension fund.  I saw cars coming from Nquthu, going by Kelumusa School, and I was watching then.  And those cars just passed right there, and they were so many, but still I hadn't heard the truth as to who exactly died because both of my sons were not home.  I left there, I went to Mhlangeni.  I saw Haladu residents there and I asked about this Mbuthu son who's been killed, and no one could open up and forthcoming to me.  I asked Pastor Mchunu, and Pastor Mchunu said, \"We've seen that Mbuthu boy lying down, and when I suggested that we have a look at him they therefore decided that we shouldn't.\"   As I was there, waiting in the queue for my pension fund, I conversed with somebody and said, \"Mbuthu's son has died in Haladu,\" and they responded and said could he be my son.  I was lost.  I told them I did not know exactly what happened.  \"They said he was taken by the police vehicle to Mondlo.  Quickly get done with this pension money and rush to the police station to have a view on the corpse.\"  And I went home.  When I got home there were tears, people were mourning.",

            "  Only to find that the mother with whom - the mother of the two children got the message as well and went home, and when she got home - they were together at the time of the incident.  And we decided we should go Nkatheni and run away, leave the area.  Now, the children were attending at Nkatheni, living at Nkatheni and attending Kelumusa School.  Now, my daughter-in-law was the one relating the whole story as she had witnessed it.  We heard from her and she told us she was expecting him at three.  He had left to go to school to leave a message there, and he never got to school, and he was killed right there before he could reach the school.  And in the morning I saw the cars there exactly where the incident took place, and my daughter-in-law had arrived, explaining as to what had happened.  It looked like as he left the house the people were following him with a gun.  Just when he left home one has a whistle, and blowing it, following him.  Now, Mrs Khumalo, the younger wife, the second wife, was relating that.  All what this will mean is that my son died.  And we made arrangements for the funeral.  We never buried him in Haladu, but we buried him where we were at the time.  After that, when we tried to go back to find out as to what would happen to his possessions and stuff, we found out that everything was taken and the house was destroyed, the doors inside completely destroyed.  The house was not in a good condition.  We took whatever we could and left, and we therefore decided maybe we should go and get the bricks so we could build a shack.  When we went to fetch the bricks that were remaining we first consulted with the police at Sipiko(?).  They took us there and told us that they were rushing somewhere.  After we had loaded the bricks in the tractor we saw the boys coming, approaching, using the other route, and other routes were closed.  Right next to the wall, standing there, we saw the group of youths coming, approaching us, and we wondered as to what we should do at that point in time.  I got off the tractor.  I tried to go back to the tractor.  I couldn't.  I did not know what to do.  People were surprised what I was up to.  When I saw them coming close, nearby, I ran along the houses, going to the other side of the wall, and there was one girl I was with and my daughter-in-law.  My daughter tried to go with my daughter-in-law and I said, \"No, don't do that.  Just follow me.  Let's take the opposite direction.\"  As you may be aware I was sick at that time, so you can imagine what I was facing and what I was in.  These others were left in the tractor and tried to take off.  Those who were coming close by tried to approach them on the other side of the road.  The tractor took off and they followed the tractor, hoping that the tractor will take a U-turn somewhere, but to no avail.  The tractor went off.  As I was trying to crawl there in the scene of this incident I managed to get to a certain spot, where I realised that there were bricks that were left there, and I was surprised how come because the bricks were supposed to be in the tractor.  When these other two from the tractor got off and tried to run, and coming back, I heard my daughter shouting and screaming, crying about the fact that she was going to lose her children.  Well, I enjoyed by stay in Haladu, in a nutshell.  I saw the tractor far away, and suddenly I saw the tractor right next to me, and they said, \"Are you the one?\"  I said, \"Yes, I am the one,\" and we went on ahead.  What can we therefore do, because there was a horse?  They arrived, and then the bricks were taken one day.  But this is such a pathetic story, the death of my son.  You know, we have parents in church.  We have parents in church.  Last year in church we had some other parents and the other relatives as well.  When they got home and found out that they were all there they said to themselves, \"Give us money, let's just go back.  We won't go to church with Khanyi.  We can't stomach and stand Khanyi.\"",

            "Mrs Dinah, as we have been listening to your story we just lost - I lost strength, and as I look right deep into the matter I realise that you are now a pensioner and you were looking up to your children to provide you with food and support you, but the direct opposite is true.  You've suffered this ordeal.  As we look into our children's future we always think and hope that they will bury us one day, take care of us as we are growing old.  But I do trust that as I talk to you, and addressing these people in the hall, everybody has listened to what has been said before the Commission, and I believe that even if there are some here who are still intending to do harm, after this they will repent, especially having listened to people like you.  The situation should really change, and people should see that what happened in the past don't happen in the future.  We will carry on and go on with our investigations, and see how we could enlist help to you and your daughter-in-law.  Thank you for taking your time to come here.   \nI would ask you to be patient.  We've come  to the end of our programme.  The lady here was the last one, and I believe that we are all touched after this testimony that has been rendered by the old lady, old as she is, due to the fact that we were fighting each other as a black community.\nMACHINE SWITCHED OFF\n/ON RESUMPTION\nON RESUMPTION",

            "(Incomplete) ... recognise a stranger and a friend amongst us, Mr Edward Verster.  Could you stand up so that we can recognise you.  Thank you.  Mr Verster is an attorney from the United States of America.  It is very encouraging to us to see that the international community is taking an interest in what we as South Africans are trying to achieve through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  You have already said that some of your own colleagues have been to listen to what - the stories that are being related by the people who have undergone different kinds of suffering during the dark ages of apartheid.  So we hope you will take our greetings back with you, and ... (incomplete - end of Side A, Tape 8) ... I have your document with me.  After we have closed then I'll be able to hand it over to you.\nWe have come to the end of the programme of the two days in Vryheid.  The only thing that's left is to thank you and put forward as gratitude as the Truth Commission.  First of all we would like to thank those who made it possible for the venue.  It's not easy to get a venue here in Vryheid, but still we managed to get this venue to accommodate all of us.  And I would still like to thank the community who took their time to come to the Commission and listen to each and everything that was said by the victims and their families, and the witnesses.  And also thank you for your patience.  We thank you, the community of Vryheid.  \nWe will put it to you as a community that on the 12th we will be in Mondlo taking statements at 10.00 am, and on the 13th we will be in Vryheid taking statements at  /the same\nthe same time, 10.00 am.  We hope that you will pass the word on.\nAnd also thank the counsellors who were present here and rendering their services to the victims.  We do trust and hope that even after we have left Vryheid they will still be there and availing their services to these different victims and families.  And also thank the interpreters.  If they were not here this wouldn't be possible.  However they manage to translate and interpret.  And also thank those who have provided the equipment.  I have such - I am not so audible when I speak, but I was able to be audible as a result of this equipment.  And also thank the police.  We are in the time when we are not so sure about our safety.  The police have taken their time and made it a point that they are here for our safety.  We would like to thank them in a special way.  And also thank the catering services.  We enjoyed the meals, no doubt about that.  And I would like to apologise because I know that not all of you ate, but you know that's what goes on in the world.  Some do get food, some don't, but you know the situation however.  And also thank the staff of the TRC, the statement-takers.  The statements are very important.  And also thank every single person who's a staff personnel at the TRC office, left Durban to make sure that this is a success and that you are comfortable as you seem to be.  Thank also my colleagues right in front.  You have seen how much effort they've put in, the three of us here.  Maybe the two of them they tried to push everything, and I do believe that you will support me in saying that everything went on smooth.\nWhen people come to ventilate here some are healed from that process - you know, coming out and ventilating the truth, because to bottle things inside you kills, but for the fact that the witnesses, the victims came forward to ventilate and take out what was eating them inside, that process itself alone is healing.  And also I want to highlight the fact that we will never have a prosperous future if we are not united.  Let us assure ourselves of a better future by way of working hand in hand together. \nMy colleague here is just mentioning that I have forgotten the media people.  No, I did not forget them.  I was about to address them.  We would like to address them.  We would like to thank them, and also the media people.  I talked to them this morning that we did not see anything on the television, national television yesterday.  Even during the news nothing was shown, but today we hope that we will have an opportunity and we will see the proceedings of the day.  \nI may be forgetting or omitting a few other things, but my colleagues will remind me, and I think we are all satisfied that we've heard and I have thanked everybody.  There is a gentleman by the name of Mr Xulu that I will ask to come forward and close this programme in prayer.  Oh, he is Pastor Xulu, not Mr Xulu.  May you request Pastor Xulu.  We will kindly ask the pastor to come forward.\nHEARING CLOSES WITH A SONG AND A PRAYER\n/TRANSCRIBER'S",
