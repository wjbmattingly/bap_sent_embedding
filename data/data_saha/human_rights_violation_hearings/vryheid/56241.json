We do trust and hope that amongst them there are families who are coming to present their stories in front of the Commission, and we do welcome each and every one of you, and we do appreciate the effort that you are giving to the witnesses in terms of support.\nIt's our wish and desire that everybody in this hall should listen to what we will say, and we have the headphones.  This is what I am lifting up to you now.  For things to be conducted orderly we would request the ones who have the headphones to listen properly to the instructions.  There are channels, and there is channel two for English, there is channel three for Zulu.  As you may realise for Zulu you won't be using channel three, it will come to the floor.  For Sotho, for those who are Sotho-speaking, we have four for them, channel four.  Channel four is for Sotho.  Those are the only languages we have for you today.\nOne other thing about these headphones, for those who are already having some, please do not take these earphones with.  They should remain in the hall.  They are useless outside this hall.  Now, we do request the audience to leave these behind.\nWithout much waste of time and without much ado - we are expecting quite a number of witnesses today - we will get started.  Some haven't arrived, but we will however get started.  We have briefers amongst us.  We have Mums, Thandwa and Nomusa.  They are standing right now, so please do contact them for any other thing.\nBefore we get started I would like to introduce the members of the panel with me up front.  On my right-hand side we have Mr Ilan Lax.  Mr Ilan Lax is the committee member of the Human Rights Violation Committee.  He is a lawyer or an attorney by profession.   This is Ilan Lax.  On my left-hand side I do have Mr Mdu Dlamini, who is a member of this committee by the name of Human Rights Violation.  He resides in Durban.  He is fairly known in Durban, and also in the Church of John Wesley.  The one who is currently talking to you is Mrs Gcabashe, and also from this Human Rights Violation Committee.  I am a member of that committee, and I do trust and hope that now we may get started, and first call upon the witness stand Mr - no, it's not Mr, it's Ms Bettina Mdlalose.  They will escort you up to the witness stand.\n/CHAIRPERSON",

            "  In 1986 June I was working, and I was from college.  I was working at the police.  I was a wardress.  I was working with Mr Sipho Zulu, who is also staying at Sibongile location, at 766 Sibongile location in Dundee. You were working with him?   ---   Yes.  As we were working with Sipho my duties were just to guard the female prisoners, and he was supposed to cook for female prisoners and male prisoners.  Basically these were people who were still on trial, not prisoners.  I asked them that I needed to go for training, and they kept on promising me that they will send me to college.  And then I left that job, I went home and I stayed home.  I applied for a job in nursing, and I waited for the nursing college to reply me.  I didn't go to the police station to receive my salary, and while I was staying at home Mr Mathonzi - they used to call him Drops - he came together with many white policemen.  They told me that I should appear in court.  At that time we were fighting, or we were boycotting rents.  As we were boycotting for not to pay rent we said we didn't want to pay rent, and Mr Drops Mathonzi came, together with white policemen.  And when I asked them why I was supposed to appear in court they said to me I must come to fetch my pay, or my salary rather.  Initially they didn't find me at home, they found my mother, and they told my mother that I should come to the police station to fetch my salary.  And the next day my mother told me, and she said I am supposed to go and fetch my salary.  So I was happy.  I took my mother with, we went to the police station, and when we arrived there everything changed and they told me that I was a suspect that I burnt Mr Sipho Zulu's house.  And I asked them when, and the police took me to Mr Joubert, who was a police at Dundee Police Station.  Mr Joubert called Flying Squad CIDs from Newcastle, and they arrived, they took me.  My mother asked them, she wanted to come with me.  They refused.  They took me to Newcastle Police Station.  When we arrived at the police station police interrogated me, and they told me I was going to tell the truth.  Mr Gama was one of the policemen.  And when I asked them what was it in connection with they told me I burnt someone's house.  I asked them I didn't have any idea about these things.  They took me to Newcastle Prison.  I arrived there and I stayed there for a long time.  They took me again and they interrogated me, and they discovered that I didn't know a thing about whatever they were asking me about, burning someone's house.  Later on we were taken from Newcastle to Utrecht, Utrecht Prison.  There we never rested because those white policemen kept on interrogating us, and in winter they would take us outside and make us stand for sunbathing for 30 minutes.  We were taken again from Utrecht back to Newcastle.  After days we were taken back to Newcastle Police Station.  I asked them that they should call Mr Gama.  I asked Mr Gama why I was in custody, and then he said to me I am a suspect that I burnt someone's house, and then I asked him, \"Am I a suspect or someone witnessed me burning someone's house?\"  And I told them to call Mr Zulu.  And then they said, \"Did you have a fight with Mr Zulu?\"  I told them no, I never had a fight.  The only thing that happened between me and Mr Zulu is that I refused to cook because he was supposed to cook.  They released me from Newcastle Police Station.  I went back home.  I was released in March.  I am not certain about the date, but it was in 1989.  I was arrested in June 1986.  I was arrested in June 1986.  I am sorry, I made a mistake.  I was released in 1987 March.  In 1987 November, when I was home, I heard that people who burnt the house were arrested.  People who burnt Mr Zulu's house were arrested, and those people were Thokozani Mthembu, Comrade Tororo Kayenda.  It was Comrade Thokozani Mthembu, Tororo Kayenda, and Comrade Mbuyiseni Duze.  It was in November 1987.  I am not certain about the date.  Those were the people who were accused of burning Mr Zulu's house after I was arrested and stayed in custody for nothing.  One other thing.  I left my son for nothing, and he was still young.  Up until today there's no attachment between me and my son.  Even though I try to do things for him he doesn't accept me.  And I would like to know if is this the truth that someone can be arrested and put in custody for nothing?",

            "  I worked in Hlobane from 1986.  That's when I first joined the mine.  When I arrived there there was a union called NUM.  After some few months working there employees were killed.  After they were killed it was after a meeting which took place in Durban, and the union was disrupted, and the whites or boers who were there were racist.  Then I went and I talked to the elderly people who were the Zulus and I tried to talk to them as to enlighten me about their views.  This started in 1987 after the union had been dismantled, and I realised that we should fix something, or we should have another union.  So in 1988 I started recruiting employees.  I did this without anyone's knowledge, and I didn't want management to find out about this.  I started going to the elderly people, recruiting them, and I realised that this union had now many members, so I went to the offices because I realised that I was succeeding.",

            "TESTIMONY_GIVER:",
            "  This was the NUM.  I got forms, I recruited a lot of employees.  In 1989 whites or boers started realising that something wasn't going right, because they realised that employees were now taking up their grievances.  Most of them used to come to me and complain about the boers, and I would take their matter forward.  And in June 1990 I called a meeting and I told employees that we should talk about the idea or the rumour that there's going to be employees who are going to be dismissed.  And then there was a rumour again that I was supposed to be killed because I was the one who was causing havoc in Hlobane.  I wasn't scared because I had the support from employees.  In August I realised that boers didn't like the idea that there was a union, and boers suggested that Xhosa-speaking people were supposed to be killed, because Xhosa-speaking employees were the ones who were causing havoc or who were the members of the NUM.  I told the employees to be brave.  Some employees resigned because of this situation.  I reported the matter to Cyril, who was still a general secretary.  He held a meeting with the Iscor people in Pretoria.  He had some talks with Mr Howard, and they were writing each other letters, which I still have today.  And they said they were supposed to search the mine because there were weapons in the mine, because these weapons arrived there because boers gave them these weapons.  Even though it was a secret, but we came to know about those weapons.  Boers denied this.  And then later we realised that the boers were the ones who were making us against each other.  They succeeded, because there was a belief at the end that the quarrel or the fight was between the Xhosa-speaking and the Zulu-speaking people.  There was a game in June 15 or 16, if I am not mistaken.  When I came back from Newcastle, from the meeting with the union, I came to know that people were about to fight, but some employees told me that no, it was nothing, it was just words.  In October I was about to go to bed at about 10 o'clock.  I heard one guy calling my wife, asking her where I was, and my wife said, \"He is around.\"  And then he said did I hear that people have smashed windows, and then I said to him, \"No, I haven't heard.\"  And then I woke up and I dressed up, and I took my wife to hospital, where she was working.  I saw a group of people coming towards me so I ran into the bush.  I tried to hide myself against the trees.  I saw a group of people who were with someone who hated me, and I knew that this guy had targeted me.  I saw him among this group of people.  After they left I continued going ahead through the bush.  Again I met another group of people, and this time they saw me, and one of them said, \"Who is this one?\"  And I answered him back, I said, \"It's Prince.\"  And then they said to me, \"Prince, go ahead, because there are people who are coming to abduct you.\"  I knew the situation, and I knew that the boers had people whom they were using, that they wanted actually us to fight the Zulus and the Xhosas or the Sothos.  I went on.  It was quite a distance.  I went straight ahead to the police station.  When I arrived there I found out there were Zulus and the Sothos and the Xhosas as well at the police station.  That's when I asked the people what was going on, and then they said to me, \"We don't know.  We were being waked up with weapons or spears.\"  I couldn't find anyone to talk to.  We slept at the police station, and then they told us to give our names.  If you were Xhosa you were supposed to give your name in a Xhosa list, and if you were Zulu you were supposed to give your name in a Zulu list.  The next morning I called the union people or members, and I explained to them that people have died and this is what had happened, and at the end I discovered that plus or minus 17 people were killed, and people who were injured were plus or minus seven.  Then I realised that there was no other way to follow this case carefully, because people who were supposed to give me more information on these things were people who were actually involved in these killings.  As time goes on I realised that I couldn't get any assistance from anyone.  Later on, as I was trying to pursue this, because I knew as well that there was no one who was going to stand for these people who were killed, and there was no one who was going to stand for the orphans or the widows.  I was the one who knew the situation inside, and I was the one who was responsible for the safety of the employees, but I couldn't get any assistance from anyone.  And later I wrote a letter to Madiba, and Madiba took my letter to Mr Mafumadi, Minister of Safety and Security, and Mr Mafumadi took the letter to the National Commissioner, and he also forwarded the letter to Natal.  I tried not to get the situation out of hand, and the commissioner from Natal, when I met him - if I am not mistaken I think his name is Mr Gerber - he told  me that he can't find other letters from the Attorney-General's office.  But what he told me is that the Attorney-General declined to prosecute, therefore he can't get the files of this case.  Therefore the situation was just left like that.  And I am certain that the boers were supporting this situation, and they also lied that employees resigned because there was no procedure or formal procedures which were followed as to resignations.  We just gave our names as Zulus and Xhosas, and what happened after that is that they gave us money after that and they told us that at least we resigned.  If your name appeared on that list it meant you resigned.  Later when we were in town on the 16th one boer came to us.  We were a group of Xhosas and Zulus, and this boer came from labour control after he was reported by someone who was working at labour department that we were at the post office.  And they came to us and they told us that we can resign or we can take a leave without pay, but that leave was not more than 21 days.  I took 21 unpaid leave days.  And then later we argued, me and this boer, because I asked him why were we fighting inside the mine.  We argued, we didn't get along well.  No one resigned at that time.  I tried to get hold with group of 10.  These were the people who were chosen.  I went to Mr Ngcube, because I knew him that he was a secretary or a chairperson,a nd I tried to talk with him.  And even though he was known as someone notorious, but I tried to talk to him.  He made some arrangements that I should go back to the time, and a certain meeting was called and I kept on contacting him through telephone.  He told me I should come to the office in No 1 office.  This was the salary office or salary department.  We talked together with someone from labour department, and I went and met the employees, and they said, \"We are surprised that you wanted us to kill this young boy.  We know this young boy very well.  We are surprised because this young boy used to help us.\"  And then I tried to report to the mine management.  This was before the 21 days were finished which I took for unpaid leave.  This happened when I was going to their offices.  The boers were laughing at my face and I didn't know why.  And Mr Ntshangase told me that some people have resigned.  When I tried to follow this I discovered that also my name was among the people who resigned.  When I tried to find out how this happened they didn't explain to me.  I went to see the PRO office person and I tried to talk to him, and he told me that there's nothing that he can talk with me, I must go and see my supervisor because he's the one who refused to approve my leave.",

You have already made mention of the fact that you don't know how to go about to contact the Amnesty Committee, but the lady seated right next to you can enlist help as to how to go about applying for amnesty before the D-date, which is the 10th of May 1997.  Am I clear, am I crystal clear?  What I will say to you is that as we have heard your name and seen your name we could tell that you have been tortured a lot, and also you were coerced to be one of the perpetrators, and this is the time when we want to know all the truth about you, as to what your mission was, who was behind you, and what were you doing.  And we are very sad because there were times when you were trying to rescue your soul and had to be a member of askari subsequently and be a traitor.  We  have heard all that.  We are sad to have heard that.  As the Commission we are trying to listen and understand people who are coming from your direction, who were trying to protect the community and ended up being on the other side.  The last thing I would like to say, it looks like you may need to meet some people from this very Commission who will advise you also psychologically.  The very same woman seated next to you is one of the counsellors also who may lead you to other counsellors, who will give themselves time to sit with you and analyse your situation and the trauma you have suffered.
