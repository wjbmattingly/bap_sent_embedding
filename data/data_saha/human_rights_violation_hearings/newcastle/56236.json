As a black person, and a Zulu too, we knew that whenever the men were fighting they would go to the river and try to wash and heal their wounds.  So this is what this is all about.  We are talking about reconciliation, as the Chairman has already pointed out.   Newcastle, or Northern Natal, is a place that is renowned for peace.  I don't know how far true that is, because we had this bad luck that whenever anything happened the media never cared to report whatever was happening here.  But most of the incidents took place in 1984, and before then there was nothing that happened that was quite as shocking as the events that took place in 1984.  ",

And whenever there was a political organisation which was fighting oppression, as well as discrimination, these people would get detained and they would be killed in detention, assaulted, and some were survivors.  That is when there was a mushrooming of a lot of political organisations which were fighting the Government, whereby they felt that they should kill everybody that's got anything to do with the Government so that the people should be liberated.  That is when there was a court in Newcastle, and thereafter the Newcastle Court was bombed, as well as the railway station and Pick 'n Pay, and there was a lot of bombings up to Madadeni Police Station that took place.

That's when the violence started, because even the schoolchildren got involved at that stage.  At that time he helped and contributed in the signing of the Peace Accord in September 1981, and that is when all the reverends, as well as Father Stephen O'Kerr, who had gone back to Kenya, they convened the town council of Osizweni and wanted its opinion as to what was going on in that particular place.  They called ANC as well to come and voice its own opinion.  They also called IFP to come and contribute as to the solution of whatever was taking place, because they wanted there to be negotiations as well as a reconciliation.  And at the time all the political organisations were convened, as well as the chairman, Father Stephen O'Kerr.   And at that time a significant incident took place.  Whilst Minister Sithebe was speaking one youth stood up and spoke whilst he was speaking, and there was an altercation until such time that there was gunfire.

We were in Port Shepstone some weeks ago, and the people there said that before 1988 and 1989 the place was completely peaceful, but that through the manipulation of certain people, politicians, participation of certain members of the police force, in the space of one year a quiet, rural community was turned into a very, very violent community.  And it seems as though a similar pattern happened in Newcastle, that this place knew peace for many, many years, and it was only through certain incidents, and involvement of certain people, that it became an unpeaceful place, and that many people died.\nSo again thank you very much for sharing your views with us today, and of course you are welcome to be with us today and the other days if you have the time.\nI just - are there any questions that any of the other committee members would like to ask?

            "  (Pause)  It was in July, towards the end of July.  It was at Durnacol Mine.  It's a mine that has different cultures of employees.  Even my father was working there.  This mine people were able to work co-operatively, but on the day when the President Nelson Mandela was released from prison in July workers asked for increase.  When they were fighting for this increase they even went to Iscor in Pretoria.  When they arrived in Pretoria they told them they must come back to Durnacol Mine and they will give them the money, and the whites in Durnacol Mine realised that these people are going to get a lot of money, and they said to the Zulus the Zulus must kill the Xhosas.  And my husband was a Xhosa, but he started working in that mine in 1975 while he was still young.  I made a mistake, it was in 1971.  I also grew up there.  When  my husband related to me this he told me that he is so worried because one senior member, his name is Pius Khumalo, was talking to another Khumalo who is a security.  He said to him, \"I don't care what you can do because I don't have household things in my house.\"  So my husband got worried.  They used to have meetings.  In August, when they were supposed to receive the money, the Zulus started getting together, having their own meetings, and one day they told us we couldn't sleep there.  I was staying at Pelindaba.  We were worried, and we told ourselves, \"No, it's just something that will pass.\"  One night we ran away to Dannhauser House, which was owned by an Indian, because this Indian guy was my husband's friend.  We asked them if we could sleep over, and we explained to him because the Zulus were angry so we were scared.  We went back.  When we arrived there we met one guy who was from church.  He said to my husband, \"Justice, how can you run away with your kids?  I mean this is nothing, it will pass.\"  So Justice said, \"Oh, because you are saying so now I have hope.\"  We went back to my house, I prepared supper.  I heard a sound and my husband asked me if I know why is this sound.  I said to him, \"No, I don't know,\" and he said to me, \"Something terrible is going to happen.\"  My husband said to me, \"We must run away with the kids.\"  When we were at the gate, when we were there, Zulus were already there with spears, pangas, lots of weapons, but except for guns.  And I called one guy, I said to him, \"Mhlanga, what's going on?\"  He said, \"No, nothing will happen, because I have a gun and all these people don't have a gun so nothing will happen.\"  I went to another neighbour who was also my husband's friend, and other neighbours came as well, and they had told the Zulus that they must put red bandannas in their heads so that they could be easily recognised that they are Zulus and they won't be killed.  And my husband and other neighbours asked them, \"What's going on really, because we consider you as our brothers-on-law because we've married the Zulus?  We've been into this area for a long time.\"  And they asked them, \"Why are you having all these weapons with you?  Are you going to kill us being our brother-in-law?\"  And he answered back and said, \"No, nothing will happen.\"  Soldiers came and they tried to resolve the thing.  We went back to our houses, and all the Xhosas the next day when to the company manager.  And the company manager told them that they must go back until the Zulus come down.  We went back.  The next day at 1 o'clock we saw a very big car, and one person was shouting, telling us, \"If you are Xhosa you need to run, to leave the house.\"  So we were supposed to leave our houses there and then.  We ran.  We took our children.  We got into the car.  We left our houses just like that.  They told us they were taking us in a safer place.  When we asked they told us we are going back.  They told us to leave behind everything.  I saw one security guy.  I said to him, \"Brother Mhlanga, would you please take care of my house,\" and I told him I am not going to Transkei, but I am going to Madadeni.  I went to Madadeni.  We left everything behind.  We left our belongings.  I went back, I took my belongings, and I went to Newcastle.  When I arrived at Newcastle I put my belongings, everything, my household in their house, and then I heard an announcement on television and radio that we should go back.  My husband called, and one guy at work said, \"No, you mustn't come, it's still bad.\"  My husband decided to change his employment because he was scared to go back.  We went to Durban.  It was then in January.  Gaja and Gozo went to Durnacol in attempts to resolve this issue, because - they wanted to resolve this because they knew that whites were behind this.  I heard that there was a list which was written, and one person who was also involved in this thing who was with the whites, Mr Zondo, he is still alive even today, and Pius as well.  They were doing this because they were getting instructions from whites.   He wanted my husband to work alone even though they had almost equal position, so that led to a quarrel, and one manager told my husband to go and open another shaft so that he can work nicely.  In 1990 my husband had written a letter to Iscor, and Iscor sent back forms to Durnacol, because he wanted a transfer to Durban.  Mr Buthelezi, who was in shaft five, said to him, \"No, brother, I trust you.  I know you will send me forms.\"  And then later on he said, \"No, they said you must come yourself personally to sign the forms.  They won't send you the forms down to Durban.\"  So I told my husband that, \"No, you should go, because some members have went there to take transfer for their children, and some to apply for their pension, and nothing happened to them, so you must also go and fill those forms.\"  In February, on the 12th, it was on Monday - I am not certain whether Monday or Tuesday - I told my husband to call first before he goes there.  He called.  He called one guy, white guy who was a labour control, and he said to him, \"No, you must come and fetch the forms personally.\"  And he said he can't send them by mail, he must come and sign there.  So my husband decided to go there personally.  He left at about 10 o'clock, and he wasn't so worried because he had heard that it was now safer.  He went there.  At that time it was peaceful, and they have already hired other people to work.  When he arrived there it was about seven.  When he was approaching the place where we were staying he was seen by Mr Zondo, and he greeted him.  And then one lady went to call Mr Xulu, and then they were talking together now that, \"Oh, here's one person who's also on the list, and then they went to hostels to call others.  Most of the people who killed my husband they didn't even know my husband.  They were new employees of that mine.  They didn't even know him.  One bakkie from Mr Khumalo they were 26, and they were singing at Zondo, and Zondo gave them spears and even forks.  I heard that his wife gave them forks.  When they arrived there they found him inside the house.  I heard he tried to ran.  He hid behind the wardrobe.  They broke the door in my brother's bedroom, and neighbours were there watching but they were scared to do anything.  They broke the wardrobe, and that's how he was killed.  He had 26 wounds.  They cut his tongue, they cut his genitals, they took his teeth out, they left him there.  They put muthi all over his body.  After I received a message I went there, I went to look for his corpse, and I was so scared because it was terrible.  And they told me they don't want to see me and my family, and they wanted to kill everything that belonged to him.  Police took his body.  After the funeral they followed us, because one night when I was at Madadeni they knocked, and fortunately my sister had a bulldog.  And the neighbours saw the car, and Mr Khumalo was there.  The person who was trying to resolve this thing, who never liked the struggle, was",

We had planned to stay in a new house, but that - everything vanished when this thing started, so I took my money and I bought a new house.  I am not working at the moment.

We also know that they encouraged the view that people who were members of the COSATU unions were Xhosa-speaking, and people who were members of the UWUSA union were Zulu-speaking, and in fact this view was also encouraged by UWUSA itself.  However, we also know that the COSATU unions comprised people who were Xhosas, Zulus, Sothos, and also English-speaking people who were Indians and coloured, and that they were working together towards one common goal, which was to improve the conditions of employment.  But the previous Government did everything possible to emphasise the difference between people, and those policies led to the division of this country into bantustans or homelands, and that has brought us nothing but division and hatred, and the new Government that we now have has got a very big task in front of it to create a single South African nation where we respect each other, not because we are Zulus or Xhosas or Sothos, but because we are fellow South Africans.",

I thought he must go to college because I was scared that if he loses his job I'll also lose my job and no one will take care of us.  On the 20th they were supposed to meet in a hotel at Madadeni.  IFP was at committee wall, and IFP went to a hotel to attack them.  And then they left the hotel because they were scared that they were going to die.  They went back home.  When I came home after church I found a lot of people at home.  I asked them what was going on, so they told me that IFP wanted to kill them so they didn't continue with the meeting.  So they re-arranged the meeting for the 27th.  They went to St Louis to ask for venue.  That Sunday morning when they were getting ready to go I went to Mahlaba because my aunt was sick.  I stayed there until I was supposed to go to church.  When I went back home I saw IFP.  They had stones inside boxes.  The IFP youths had carried those boxes, and when I went home I found my children were not there, and I told my wife that, \"I am not feeling all right, I feel like going to that meeting.\"  And my wife told me that I mustn't go there because she is scared that I might get hurt.  So I made a call to section 4 and I found that there was no one.  I also made another call to another family and there was no one as well.  In the afternoon after church, I think was half past two after church, when I was approaching my house I saw my son, and when I tried to stop him he didn't want to stop.  So I told my son why is he carrying ... (inaudible) ... and I heard that cars were stoned by IFP, and I went to the police station.  When I arrived at the police station I found that cars were stoned outside the police station, and the station commander didn't allow those cars to be parked inside.  And I realised that there was a problem.  And one policeman came out and shouted at the IFP members, and I went inside the court.  And when I arrived there I found the commissioner fighting with them, and when I asked them, \"What's going on?\" so they explained to me that cars are finished, people were stoning cars.  So I told my sons that day they must come back home.  After they finished giving their statements they came back home.  When they arrived at home we talked about this.  My wife prepared a meal for me, I ate, and then I went outside, I sat under a tree.  And  my children brought cool drink for us.  At about half past five we saw a group of IFP members approaching to our house.  They went into Xulu's house.  Xulu is my neighbour.  We sat there because we wanted to see what was going on, and then late in the evening we went inside the house.  After supper we sat for a while.  My wife went in the bedroom to sort out her laundry.  I was sitting in my sitting-room, facing in the direction as I am sitting today.  I only saw fire coming from my bedroom to the sitting-room, and my children stood up and went outside.  My elder son, Dumisani, went outside first, and then my other son followed him.  The curtains were burning in my bedroom.  When I went there with my wife, trying to - when we tried to put out the fire we couldn't because the whole house was now alight, and we heard gunfire.  My house had 13 windows.  All 12 had broken and my house was on fire, the ceiling.  At that time my wife was also burning.  We made one mistake.  We were supposed to take her into hospital, but we were dumb, we took her to another place.  That's where she died.  When my son came back there was no policemen even though we called the police.  Inkatha came.  One station commander by the name of Mthethwa came and said to me, \"I am here to take you to go and make a statement,\" so I told him, \"No, I don't want to because you have arrested these people and how come now they are here?\"  So he insisted.  I refused.  My son pursued me to go with him, so I went with him.  And Mr Mthethwa said, \"It's so bad because she is already dead now.\"  When we arrived at the police station when I was supposed to give the statement gunfires were all over the place.  My house is nearer the police station.  We went by three vans.  We found Inkatha members in my house, and they were firing guns.  They took a bag which was on top of my headboard.  They took that bag.  Up until today from 1986 - I reported this case to the Zulu Police.  No one was arrested up until today.  Mthethwa came, and Inkatha members saluted at him and told him that we are the ones.  Then they were scattered thereafter, and the police also went away.  We were left in the house.  The house had no windows.  The curtains were burnt together with the house, but at that time we were there at night we just couldn't sleep because the house was open.  The car was also burnt.  There is a certain policeman who took a statement from a certain male.  He said that in the statement we were asleep, but it was half past eight when the house was burnt and at nine we went to the police station.  But he insisted that we were sleeping at that time.  I found that to be gross corruption because he was not telling the truth.  The case of the car never got any further, and they came back the very same night, and I realised that there was no way out, I had to phone the police, and when they came back I phoned a certain nephew of mine.  I told him that my house had been burnt, as well as my car, and he asked me as to when this happened.  He helped me out because he took a certain white person.  They went into the police statio, and as they were coming they started shooting.  That's when the Inkatha people ran way, and they didn't come back thereafter.  But we never slept on that day, because at about 3 o'clock Chris Mkhize passed by, and my children were very angry at that time, they wanted to go and attack, but I restrained them.  Then there is Mdlalose.  Mdlalose also came.  He came to check as to what was done by his members, that is the members of the Inkatha.  Because at that time he was a Minister of Health, and he was not a minister of people who were not members of the IFP.  Then in the morning of the following day I went to the police station to report about the damage.  We submitted statements, but we did not submit full statements because we did not trust them.  My wife was admitted to the hospital, then on the 4th of May, which was a Saturday - I went on the 3rd of May, that was on a Friday afternoon.  Then she took me halfway to the gate.  She was having drips.  And then on the 4th, that's on a Saturday, I went to see her after dinner, and her condition had deteriorated and I asked as to what had happened.  The nurses also said they did not know, because the following day when they came they discovered that her condition had worsened.  She said to me I must look after her kids.  I looked at her and I kept quiet.  I could feel tears streaming down my face, and I went out.  It was at night.  I went back the following day, we were from church, and she was very serious, her condition was quite serious.  And at that time she once said again that I should look after her children.  I went away that Sunday.  Then the following day on Monday at seven I received a telephone call that I should go to the hospital, and I knew that by then she was dead.  When I arrived I was told that she had died that morning.  I took her clothes and I came back to prepare for the funeral.  But the most disturbing thing is that on the Monday morning when I received this telephone call there came certain people who were supposed to take fingerprints, and they were coming from Dundee.  They pitched up and dusted for some fingerprints.  I think the policemen were - the bottles were - there were 16 bottles which were put on top of the roof.  At the time that they were shooting they did not want to be seen.  So they dusted for these fingerprints, and at that time up until now I have never been told or informed, as a person who lost his wife as well as his possessions, as to what has happened to the people who bombed my house.  The police KwaZulu Police as well as the police in town took the statements, and made the statements their possessions, but they never followed the matter up.  I knew that the police were used by the station commanders.  They were the ones who directed them as to what to do.  And after the funeral - just before the funeral the police came to keep a vigil, and some were nearby the office.  There is a spokesman for NACTU, Paulos Nkosi, who did not sleep at his place on that particular day because after the funeral, when he went back to his home, the police were waiting for him, and they were asking him about the statement that he made at the funeral, and he was arrested.  But I don't remember how long he stayed there, but he was detained.  After I had buried my wife I kept on checking as to what was happening to the case, but there was absolutely no report that I was given.  I went to Mthethwa, who said that I should write a formal letter, because at that particular moment he was still busy.  He never replied to my letter.  I never got any response.  And later on, after I had forgotten about the letter, I received a letter from Mthethwa, who said I should come and see him at the police station.  I went to him on a Tuesday.  At quarter past two I was getting to the police station, and I went to talk to Mthethwa, but I could not see him.  I stayed there up until five without seeing any trace of Mthethwa.  Then at that time I decided that I should go, but it was dark and I was thinking that I could possibly be killed, and I told one policeman that I was going.  Then this policeman said to me I should not go straight to the gate, but I should walk along the fence and try and get some place to escape, but I should not go through the gate.  Then I realised that Mthethwa had planned this that I should stay until late at the police station, and they had planned to kill me also and they were going to get my corpse thereafter without knowing who killed me.  I listened to this young policeman, I went along the fence until I got an escape route, and when I got home I phoned Kwenza Mlaba and he said he would phone Kwenza Mlaba.  He phoned, Kwenza Mlaba - he phoned Mthethwa and spoke to him.  He further came back to me and told me that he had phoned Mthethwa.  Then they came during the day, they would assault my children, and they would also come at night and fight with my children.  That's the life that I have lived ever since they were terrorising my family.  I was working three shifts, from six to two and from two to 11, as well as from 11 up until morning.  And in the morning when I go to work - my bedroom is in the front - whenever I put the lights on I would hear people whistling outside.  And I was scared because I felt that I was not safe from the KwaZulu Police, so whenever I went to work I never took a straight route.  And most of the time I did not put off my light in the bedroom because they knew.  And one time they came across me.  I saw them, and they just looked at me.  I knew that they were armed, but they never did anything.  I went to work on that particular day.  That is the life that I have lived.  Whenever I was working night shift, especially 11 to seven, every time on Friday, or every Friday the police would come and swear at my children, they would kick the doors, they would assault them.  But at night it was not the KwaZulu Police but it was de Kock, as well as other boers.  They would traumatise and terrorise my family.  And they would search the house, they would turn it upside-down.  But they knew my bedroom, and each time they used to go straight to my bedroom.  They never went into my bedroom.  They would go into the other rooms, but they never went into my bedroom.  At times when I was working the day shift they would come after lunch and they would say we should all get out of the house, and there were quite a few black policemen who were with them.  There was no case whatsoever with regard to the incident that took place earlier.  And Mr Dube went to open up a case, accusing my children of having broken his windows.  This case was heard, but there wasn't enough evidence and my son was acquitted.  Thereafter he was accused of having assaulted certain children, and they wanted to attack him.  Later on he was accused of having ridiculed some other people, saying they were Inkatha members.  And when I went to the police one policeman who was from KwaZulu said to me, \"When I talk about Inkatha I talk about God.\"  I said, \"At my place there is no god except the Almighty.\"  Then I told him that I was going to phone Mlaba in Durban.  I phoned Mlaba in the morning, and he was released on bail.  Then when the case went on he was also acquitted in that matter.  Now, I kept on being arrested and my children kept on being in and out of prison, being accused of doing certain things and offences.  Then on a certain Friday I was using a certain machine and the machine got broken, and we were told to knock off and go back home, and at 12.30 the policemen came to my place.  When they got to my place they said they wanted to see Ephraim.  I told them that Ephraim was at college and they told me that they had heard that he was not at college, because there were many informers.  I was not an ANC member, I was a activist in the union, that is SEAWU at Falkirk.  And when they came to knock they knocked using their guns, and now I realised that the police were somehow protecting me because they were coming to my place almost every day.  At times they would search and say we were hiding ANC documents, as well as banned books, and they were told that the books were being kept in the chimney.  The went into Zwelinjane's bedroom, Zwelinjane at that time was not at home.  They searched, and de Kock called me outside.  I don't know whether my younger or my elder girl went out, but we stood on the grass and de Kock said the law says that all of us should be arrested if we did not want to disclose Zwelinjane's whereabouts.  They said we knew where he had gone to  because he was not at the college.  I explained to him",

            "that Zwelinjane had a girlfriend, he might probably be at his girlfriend's place, but I didn't know where the girlfriend stayed.  They said I should look for another male, and I realised that if we got arrested the Inkatha would come and burn down the house.  And I told Nhlanhla to go and look for Zwelinjane, and Nhlanhla went together with the police.  They went to Mountain.  When they got to Mountain they did the very same thing that they did in my house.  When they got into the house they got Zwelinjane, and they wanted to search him but he refused.  And he undressed, he took out some money, approximately R400,00.  He took everything out and he was left naked.  He was throwing the clothes at them so that they could search the clothes and search everything.  They said he was stubborn and he was arrogant, and they said he should get dressed.  They took him and they detained him.  And I had told them to bring my son so that I could see whether he was still alive.  They threw him along the road and they said they were in a hurry.  The following morning I went to tell my nephew what had happened the previous day, and they were taking photos.  I went to de Kock and I asked him as to whether he had acted in terms of his promise.  He said he was busy with my son.  There is a certain male - I don't remember his name, I think he was from the Sibisi family -and this boy said to me, \"There's no smoke without fire.\"  Then he said there's fire at my place, that is why there's so much smoke.  I should not make fools of them.  Then I  went to de Kock.  De Kock said I am not going to get my son back.  Ultimately de Kock said I should get my son back, but the police kept on refusing.

I suspected that we were going to be killed.  The manner in which they were driving leaves a lot to be desired.  The car hit a pole when it was taking a turn, and he was driving at high speed.  My boy went out and we were left in the car, and we were left there with Sikosana.  And I asked them as to why they were arresting me because they had no evidence that I had done anything.  That was the last time that they arrested my son, but they kept on hunting us.  They would come home, harass us, traumatise my family.  They would swear at us, assault us, up until such time that every time in the evening I would put a spotlight, and whenever they were singing outside, saying, \"Kill Inkatha, kill,\" I would put the spotlight on.  Then in December, on the 31st at night, I called my children to come back home.  This one was still young at that time, and the two were left in the street just a few minutes when I was sitting underneath the tree.  I heard some gunfire and I went out.  I discovered that Dumisani had been shot, had been shot in the street.  I phoned the police.  Mlojwa came and wanted to take the corpse, but my children refused.  I begged them to let go of the corpse up until Mthethwa had taken the corpse and took him to mortuary, because at that time he was dead already.  That is the case now when the Minister of Inkatha said there should be some investigations because his police were being harassed.  This is the only investigation that was done.

Now these children are being maintained by my own kids.  There is Siphelele.  These children are being maintained by my children.  Vusi Khumalo is working, and he is maintaining his own parents, but my child is dead now.  After all this had happened I tried to find out as to the progress in the investigation, but I was told different stories each time that the statements were taken to Ulundi.  Buthelezi was busy and could not look at the statement.  And from then I was harassed by the police.  They said I was creating havoc by coming to the police station each time.  I went to Mbele, and Mbele looked for the statement but could not get the statement anywhere, up until such time that I went to the prosecutor, who told me that he knew nothing about the matter.  He said that I should go and speak to the ANC.  That is the prosecutor who said.  I said that I had not come to talk about the ANC, I had come to investigate about the cases that I had reported, and he threatened that he will arrest me.  I stayed without knowing what was going on with the cases.  I started from scratch buying household goods because all my possessions were destroyed in the fire.  I had big windows, so it was easy for them to destroy everything that was in the house.  They also confiscated certain possession.  They shot at the house, and they also broke all the windows, and they put on a fire from the stoep.  I had to put on a new ceiling as  well as new planks before I could put the roof.  I waited",

He also tried to write to the KwaZulu Police, but he would tell me that he was not getting any reply from the KwaZulu Police.  And Mthethwa said there's absolutely nothing that he could do at that time because there was no response from the KwaZulu Police.  I was told that I should be arrested because I was Mkhize's enemy.  Then thereafter Alfred Kubheka, my brother, was also killed.  He was shot and killed.  Alfred was present when my house was burnt.  Alfred, as well as Mkhize, were shot, and apparently we were supposed to be investigated with regard to the shooting of Mkhize and Alfred.  They said I was a suspect.  I told them that they got any guns at my place so how could I have shot Mkhize?  Because I was a working man, I was an ordinary civilian.  I had no guns and I did not belong to any political organisations, so I had absolutely nothing to do with the shooting of Mkhize and Alfred.  I left the police at that juncture and I went back to work.  I kept on being told that anyone who was not a member of Inkatha was not welcome in that particular residential area.  I lived that life, and my children grew up in that situation.  My other one is still at school, and I decided one should leave school because the Inkatha members would go to where he was attending school, and Inkatha would be deployed in that area so that they would accost him.

            "We have heard stories like the one that you have told us from so many other parents who have talked about the disappearance of their - mainly about their sons, and when we hear these stories we realise that we lived in a very unusual, abnormal society, where parents had no expectation that they would see their children grow up securely and safely in their own houses.  So many of these young people were forced into exile, into strange places.  Some of them returned after their training, and they were killed or they were arrested by the police.  A small number of them were imprisoned in camps run by the ANC in Zambia and Angola.  Many of them came back in 1990 and 1991, and some of them simply disappeared and have not been heard of.  It seems like your son was one of these, and it must have been very difficult to have spent this long time wondering about where he was, worrying about where he was.  In fact some parents have told us that they would even prefer to know that their son had died.  At least they would have some rest, rather than to go on worrying about him.\nAs Mr Lax has said, we will try to investigate what happened to your son.  It's a long time, it's 20 years, so we can't guarantee that we will be successful, but we've -in fact Mr Lax has already taken steps through our investigation unit to contact the ANC to see whether they have any information on their books as to where your son might be, and we will certainly pass that information on to you as soon as we get it.\nSo we thank you and your family very much for coming in her today, sharing your story with us, and we hope very much that we will be able to bring you some good news in the future.  Thank you very much indeed.",

            "  In 1992 it was about 10 midnight I received a call, a person who identified himself as Mr Thango from Eshowe.  He called for my husband, he said he wants to speak to my husband.  So I said to him, \"You can talk to me because he is still busy.\"  So he insisted and said he needs to speak to him, not me.  I called my husband, and then after he spoke to the telephone he said to me - he looked scared, and I said, \"Why are you scared?\"  So he said, \"Some people are coming to kill us.\"  So I said to him, \"Let's run then.\"  He said, \"Ja, we must run.\"  And I asked him, \"Who are coming to kill us?\"  He said, \"Inkatha people are coming after us.\"  So at that time lots of things have happened from 1989 to 1990, and I could see that they were fighting with Inkatha, even though I didn't know why they were fighting.  I said to him, \"We better run,\" and Mrs Dlamini said we mustn't run away.  And she said, \"If you run away now then you'll always run away for life, so better stay inside the house.\"  So he said to me if he could die I must know that he has been killed by Themba, who is a member of Inkatha youth from section 1.  I said to him, \"I think it's going to be difficult because I don't even think that I'll survive myself.\"  So he said to me, \"No, we will survive.  They are just scaring us.\"  So he said we must go to bed, we must go to sleep, but I was too scared to fall asleep.  There was my child - his child actually, and a child who came to visit.  So I told them that they must close the windows and the doors because we are scared that we might be attacked.  At about quarter to 11 we heard a gunfire.  I am not sure whether it was windows.  He woke up quickly and went to the door, and at that time they were smashing the windows and we realised that these people were many.  I went to the telephone in my bedroom.  I called 92689.  That number was Madadeni Police Station number.  The person who answered the phone said it's not Madadeni Police Station, so I said to the person, \"Okay, can you please do me a favour, call the \"police station and tell them that in No 697 in Madadeni we are in danger?  People are smashing windows, burning, and many people are outside armed.\"  And that person said to me, \"It's okay, I'll do you that favour.\"  I don't know whether that person called the police station, but what I can tell you is that it was actually at Madadeni Police Station.  They broke the windows, they broke the doors, both doors, and my husband said to them, \"Okay, you can come in now.\"  So they didn't want to come in.  They started speaking to each other, saying, \"You must go first.\"  And one person shouted out and said, \"We've been looking for you for a long time,\" and this person said, \"We must get inside and kill him inside the house.  And my husband said to me I must hide myself under the table, and he was now crying, and I could see that it was the end and I realised that all of us were going to die.  I really don't know what actually happened.  Those people who were standing at the kitchen door came inside, and then he left the house, he ran to the neighbour, and one guy shouted out and said, \"Come this side.  Here's the dog this side.\"  And then they attacked him.  He was screaming, asking them what exactly did he do, why are they killing him.  They chopped him.  They had forks, spears, lots of weapons.  Some weapons I can't even name them.  I am not quite sure.  Other people are calling some weapons as bayonets.  And then one of them said, \"Guys, you think we are actually going to kill this man, or what?\" and then one person answered back and said, \"Ja, we are here to kill him.\"  And then I realised that he is now dead, and I heard one person saying, \"It's okay now, we've killed him.\"  At that time the house was on fire.  I went out through the front door, and I could hide myself in that smoke.  And then one guy said, \"There's another target,\" and one person answered him back and said, \"No, we've killed the person we came to kill.  We don't want to kill women.\"  I ran, and then two guys chased me.  I ran to a third house.  I hide myself under the tree.  They passed, they couldn't see me.  I crawled to the door, I knocked.  But people at that time were scared, scared for their lives.   They said to me, \"Don't wake up.  Just lie down there as you are, because they will see you and they will kill you,\" and they asked me, \"Where are your kids?\"  I told them, \"Maybe they have ran.\"  And then when my kids left the house they ran into the direction where they attacked their father, and their father was still breathing at that time.  He spoke to them and said, \"Deli, where's your mum?\" and they said, \"She ran as well.\"  So he said to the kids - he actually asked the kids if I was still alive, and they said they don't know, and then he said to them they must take care, and that's when he died.  After 30 minutes this group of people went to Sikananda Mavuso's house, and they also went there as if they were going to attack him, but nothing happened except that they broke his windows, and I am sure no one got hurt there.  What I heard afterwards is that they were singing, singing a song that says, \"Thank you, Father.  Thank you for saving us from sinning.\"  And then I stayed there.  They didn't want people to come as I was grieving, and then after a day police came.  I was surprised who called them, because when I called they said it wasn't at the police station.  Now I was surprised who contacted them.  When they arrived there they took my husband's corpse.  They came to me and asked me questions.  I stayed there until my relatives and my husband's relatives came.  Sometimes at night I couldn't stay inside the house, and I was scared because they used to come with weapons.  When I saw them I was scared, and people were also scared to come and stay with me.  On Sunday we decided to go to my husband's home where he was born.  That's where he was buried.  After a week I went to KwaZulu Police, I asked them if something was going on or investigation was conducted, and then they - because my husband before he died told the police that, \"If I die Themba Nkabinde will be the one who would have killed me.\"  And then one policeman said to me, like he was teasing me, that, \"Guys who are real guys are dead.\"  And I asked him, \"All I am here for is to - I want to know what's going on.  Is there any investigation about my husband's death?\"  And they said, \"No, this is a difficult case.\"  I told the police, \"It's not a difficult case because he told you who would have killed him if he died.\"  After seven months after I buried my husband I went back to my house, because my husband's family advised me to go back to my house.  After four months having been in my house a Ford Granada came, and people who were driving that car asked me if I am Mrs Madela, and I said, \"Yes, I am Mrs Madela.\"  So they said, \"Are you sure?\"  I said, \"Yes, I am sure.\"  They said to me, \"We are referring to Madela, the one who was killed here.\"  So I said, \"Yes, I am the one.\"  So they said to me, \"We are here to tell you that we are coming to fetch you tomorrow morning.  Where you are going you will see.  We won't tell you now.\"  So I started crying, and the driver said to me, \"You mustn't cry, I am Mr Matha.\"  And then the other one said, \"I am",

So my sister said, \"You can stay in my house for a while.\"  My sister asked me what am I going to do with my household goods, so I told my sister that, \"It really doesn't matter.  My life is more important than my properties.\"  I stayed there for four months, and my family advised me to go and rent in town.  I went to town at Aboo Park(?).  That's where I rented a flat.  One day I went to my house, and I had asked people to take care of my house.  I received a letter from a superintendent asking me to come to his office and talk to him.  I went to his office at Madadeni, and Mr Jele said to me, \"Mrs Madela, do you know that I was supposed to take you out from that house a day after your husband had died?\"  So I said, \"No, I didn't know that.  And how were you going to do that, because I am his legal wife?\"  So he said to me, \"The law says I must take \"you out.  Now I am calling you to tell you that I am taking that house.\"  I told him that, \"No, don't do that because that's my house, and I have spent so much money to renovate the house.\"  He said he is taking the house, and he said to me what he can do for me, he can look for a stand for me, for a site.  And then he said to me the reason he is taking the house it's because I didn't pay the rent.  So I told him, \"But this is the usual thing.  We only pay rent once a year, and I am still prepared that I am going to buy the house.\"  And he said to me, \"That's okay, you can leave now and you'll see me another day.\"  I explained to him that the reason I am not in that house it's because I am scared, not because I don't want that house.  And then he said to me he will look for another house in another section where he is going to put me, because someone had bought that house.  And I was surprised because I was still alive, and whoever bought the house didn't buy the house from me.  He sold my house on his own.  As I am talking today there's a woman who's staying in my house who is single, and he chased me out of my house.",

And we see you here today looking very strong, and it is a credit to you that you have been able to recover from such an awful incident, so much so that you can come here and tell us your story today.  It is also a shocking thing that you received no help from the police, and we know from other statements that we've received from people in Madadeni how the KwaZulu Police behaved in those days, that they did not come to the assistance of people like yourself, and very often they assisted and took part in the attacks on people who held the views that you and your husband did.  And by doing that they made a mockery of their uniform and of their profession.\nFrom the information that you've given us we will try and trace this docket which must have been opened by this Sergeant Ndlovu.  We will try and find out whether he collected any statements.  We will try and find out who Themba Nkabinde was, and we will try - although we cannot guarantee anything we will try to find out the perpetrators were of your husband's death.

            "  In 1972 I was working for the Beares Group in town, and at that time we used the transport at a certain taxi rank, and we used taxis at that particular time, or buses.  But on a certain day when I was waiting for the taxi then I saw a certain investigator for the Special Branch.  His name was Mhlongo.  He asked me as to where I was headed for.  I told him that I was going to work, and he further asked me as to whether I was late or I could go with him.  Then he offered me a lift.  As he was driving along the road he was driving very slowly, and many of the cars were passing him, overtaking him.  I even asked him that I suspected I was going to be late because I was supposed to start work at eight, and I thought maybe if I took a taxi I would reach work quite quickly.  He said he wanted to ask me something, and I said he should be free, he should ask anything he wanted to.  He asked me as to where I was attending school in 1960, and I told him that I was attending school at Shalstone.  And he asked me as to who was the headmaster at that time.  I told him it was a certain Mr Sithole.  And he asked me as to whether there wasn't anyone who was a headmaster before Mr Sithole, and I told him it was Mr P V Mbatha.  And he asked as to what I was doing at that time, and he asked me where P V Mbatha was.  I told him that he could not ask me as to where P V Mbatha was because I did not know, but I could give him leads of who he could approach and try to find out about P V Mbatha, because I knew nothing about P V Mbatha.  By the time I got to the school he was at Rhodesia.  He told me that some people were saying they were working for the community but they were actually killers.  I told him I did not understand what he meant by what he was saying.  He said some people alleged that they were helpers of the community.  For instance certain people were coming with AK-47s and killing people, but they would later on claim that they were protecting the community.  And he went on asking me as to how we could kill people, and I told him that I could not answer those questions because I knew nothing.  I did not know what he was referring to.  He said to me I must not answer him on the basis of being an investigator, but I should answer him just as an ordinary person.  I asked him as to what he was referring to, and why was he asking me.  Did he suspect me of having done anything?  He said he asked me because he could see that I was involved in the community, and I knew quite prominent people in the community.  He said to me I knew people who occupied high positions, and I asked him as to what he meant by that.  So he further pointed out that I was always present at the meetings which were held and where these prominent speakers were presenting statements.  And he asked me about the children who had skipped to Cuba, and I asked him as to what had that got to do with me.  He told me that there was a lot happening.  For instance Frank Mdlalose was probably busy helping the children to skip the country.  I further told him that I do not understand what he was getting at, and I wanted to go to work because I was late.  Then he let me get off.  Then on another day he said he wanted to see me, and at that time he was with other people in the car, and he said he wanted to see me very urgently.  And time went on.  By that time I was working for an insurance company.  And when I went to the hospital to work I came across his wife, who also said she wanted to see me because she wanted to take a policy from my insurance company.  I made an appointment with her for the following day, and she said she was going to be off duty.  And I went off to see her, and when I got there she was busy with the house chores and I sat in the sitting-room.  Just after a few minutes she came and she greeted me and went away.  And later on Mhlongo came, and Mhlongo was wearing a gown.  He sat in front of me and he greeted me.  And I asked myself as to what was happening because his wife had actually called me to come and do a policy for her, but now it was Mhlongo who was now sitting with me, and I suspected that there could possibly be a trap.  And we continued with our small talk but we did not go any further, and I decided that I should go because there wasn't much we were talking about.  He wanted to accompany me to show me out.  Then he went into his bedroom, he came back.  He was fully dressed and he was having his car keys, and he said to me we should get into the car.  We drove out.  He started and he drove in the very same place that he was driving on that day that he gave me the lift.  I started suspecting that he had something to tell me, maybe he wanted to say something.  And we drove to my place.  He stopped at the gate.  I asked him as to what his problem was because I could see he wanted to talk to me about something.  His response was that he did not want to say anything to me, but he just wanted to explain to me that as I was a person who was very prominent, who was very popular, and who used to attend meetings, maybe if we could get together it would be for the benefit of both worlds, that is his world as well as mine.  And I asked him as to what he meant by this.  He said, \"The Government can even buy you a car, or give you a car, buy you a house.\"  And I started suspecting.  I asked him as to whether he was referring to me being an informer.  He refuted that, but he said if I could work hand in hand with him, and report on whatever was being said at the meetings that we attended, there is a lot that the Government could do for me because the Government paid.",

            "  On that day I told him that I could not do what he wanted me to do, and thereafter he stopped troubling me.  But at the time - it was in 1973 and I was staying at section 27.  I was Dr Frank Mdlalose's neighbour.  He was staying at 27/72 - maybe he is staying somewhere else now - and I was staying at 27/78.  Then in 1975 there was a certain Inkatha group that was formed, then there was a certain sergeant at the prison, Sergeant Khumalo.  He has now moved to Durban Central Prison.  And Khumalo asked me to join Inkatha.  I asked him what was the significance of the group, what were the objectives of the group?  He said to me it was a cultural as well as a community group, which was going to be the channel through which the grievances of the community were going to be addressed.  He went on further to explain that since I was involved in the community this would be a good organisation to join.  And he said he wanted me to attend a certain meeting, an Inkatha meeting, and the chairman of that meeting was Mr Mdlalose, who is the present premier.  I went to that meeting, and I heard that there was going to be elections, and I also got elected, I got a position in that Inkatha.  And the position that I got was that I was Chief Buthelezi's deputy, who has since now been deceased, and he was a circuit inspector at that time.  I was told that I was going to be his deputy secretary.  And we formed a certain committee.  As we were still working under this committee we were told that we should try to hold certain cases, that is neighbours' matters or matters of the community.  We were quite united at that time, and I knew that the Inkatha organisation was a cultural organisation which was acting in accordance with the requirements of the community, and I never knew that at a later stage it would turn out to be something that was fighting against the community.  We did our job with quite a lot of resilience, and there was a certain Sergeant Khumalo who was our chairman.  After discovering that my mother was all by herself I decided to go back home to my mother's place.  I did not want to take her from her place and bring her to where I was staying.  As I was at my mother's place at that time Madonsela was a councillor in that area.  And at that time I grew less and less interested in politics, and I was just staying, not being affiliated to any political organisation.  Then in 1987 there came a certain councillor, D A Bhengu.  He was the councillor at that time.  And when he got there he said he had come to ask me to take his position and be a councillor because he was being transferred, he had got a post at Ondini and he was going to be an MP.  I told him that I was less interested in politics and I did not want to take part.  He begged me to take the position because he said I was the candidate that he first thought of who could take that position.  Then I said to him I will sit over it and I will decide later on.  He asked me to attend the meeting which was going to be at 2 o'clock that afternoon.  Then I went to DNC.  Just as I got there the members of the church were going out, and I turned back with them, I came back.  And he said to me, \"Let us now go to the meeting.\"  When I went to the meeting I discovered that Bhengu was not there, but he had sent certain people who were candidates, who had been chose as candidates for this position.  And when we got to the meeting there was an election.  I was also nominated and I was chosen to be a councillor.  Then thereafter I discovered that the mayor was Jeffrey Nkosi.  No, it was Zondo.  He has since died.  At that time when I got to the meeting there was some conflict amongst the councillors themselves, because they felt that there was some favouritism that was going on with regard to the elections.  And we continued in that spirit of non compliance as well as non co-operation.  After about two months Nkosi was also chosen.  He was elected as a mayor.  And I did not see eye to eye with Nkosi, because the things that he was doing I was challenging them, and I used to tell them whenever he was acting wrongly.  That's how we got to be on the opposite ends of each other.  Then there was a Chief Magistrate, Mr Webber.  He convened a meeting.  At that time there was a political group called the UDF, and he convened a meeting where he said he wanted all the leaders of the political groups so that we could thrash out certain issues.  He wanted to resolve the matters because there was so much conflict and so many people were dying, and he wanted us to come with suggestions as to how to quell the violence that was taking place in the community.  I went to that meeting because I was also a leader.  This meeting was held at a certain hall next to the court building.  Just before Webber opened this meeting he said he wants everybody who is going to talk be a constructive speaker and try to quell the violence.  He did not want to entertain any destructive criticism because he wanted to get a solution to the present problem of violence.  Somebody started talking, then when he opened the meeting F J Siwela lifted up his hand.  He said, \"Mr Webber, I think the UDF is having problems with the IFP, because the UDF was busy following and chasing members of the IFP.\"  Webber said he should sit down because he was not being constructive.  He told him that he wanted somebody who could bring a solution to the problem, and not a problem to every solution.  He again lifted his hand, that is Siwela, and Siwela continued to talk in this manner, and he was admonished by Chief Magistrate Webber.  And I lifted my hand to be the next speaker, and Webber allowed me the platform and I said whatever I had to say at that time.  And Webber asked as to whether they had heard me, and he asked as to whether they supported me, and they supported me and they gave me a round of applause.  I sat down and people continued talking, different speakers getting the platform.  I lifted my hand once more and Webber pointed at me to give me the platform.  And he further asked as to whether they had heard what I had said and they supported me once more.  I think I stood about four times or more.  Then thereafter the meeting was adjourned.  After the meeting there was rumour that there was going to be a special meeting which was going to be held at the council chamber, and we were told that everybody should be there at 6 o'clock at the council chamber for this very special meeting.  The community members also went there, as well as members of different political groups, and when we got to the council chamber the very first speaker who took the platform was Jeffery Nkosi, who was the then mayor.  Jeffery Nkosi addressed the community and told them that he had called them to try and resolve the problems that were prevailing within the community, but pointed out that there were certain members, or certain people in this meeting who were informers, but he did not want to mention as to who these people were.  He referred to the Chief Magistrate meeting and he said, \"There is a person who was very prominent and he was busy talking to a certain Professor Nzimbankulu, and they were showing that they were colluding, but we were not going to mention any names.\"  I did not pay much attention to that because I did it in good faith.  When I spoke I did it in good faith.  He further pointed out that he was going to give Mr Siwela the platform, and he should tell us as to what is going to happen.  And Siwela stood up and addressed the members of the community, and said the mayor was going around in circles and not pointing out as to who the informer is.  Then he pointed at me and said I was the informer.",

            "  Before I got attacked I just wanted to explain that when the violence started.  This violence started because the council took Mr Siwela to section 7 and said he must give people sites, and when he gave those sites to the people he is the first person who formed Inkatha in that place at that time.  And Inkatha was running around day in and day out calling their war cries, and they were also carrying Inkatha flags, especially the Inkatha youth.  They were always having this flag in the mornings.  Then I approached Siwela and asked him as to why he was using the youth to run his mile.  He said he wanted to be protected.  Then on that same day when we were in the meeting Themba Nkabinde, who was in the meeting, came to me and said, \"Mr Dlamini, do you know that I can quell the violence that was at section 7?\"  He said he could quell the violence which was prevailing in section 7.  Then on the following week when I met him Themba came to me and said he had already devised a plan, and there was a group called Savuka which was harassing people at section 1, and he said he wanted to take these youths from the Savuka group and recruit them to be Inkatha members.  And he said if he could recruit these people and make them Inkatha members they will stop being this group of vagabonds.  He wanted to make them Inkatha members, and this group was a group of criminals and they ... (inaudible - end of side A) ... this was a group of rapists.  They were raping all the females in the community.  Whenever they raped women they wanted their men to watch whilst they were raping the women.  They were so brutal in the manner that they were conducting their rapes.  That was happening every day.  Now I'll come back to the point, because I seem to be having a very long story.  People were dying in large numbers and nobody knew who had killed them, but the police would come in their vans and take the people to the mortuary, the corpses to the mortuary.  And whenever you went to the police to report a certain crime or offence they never paid any attention.  And we had no recourse at law, because whenever we went to report, even before the murders took place, the police never paid any attention.  Then on the 3rd of September 1993 the community at section 7 was attacked by the very same Inkatha criminal groups.  These criminals came at about half past six.  It was in summer and it was just slightly dark.  And they would get into houses.  They started looting houses.  They would take TV sets as well as radios.  At my neighbour's place they took the radio as well as the TV.  If you were selling they would take anything that you were selling, and that was in 1993 on a Friday, on the 3rd.  The following day, on the 4th of September, we convened a meeting to try and get a solution to the violence that was quelling the community.  As we were discussing the issues we decided to postpone the meeting to the 5th, that is on Sunday, and there's a certain place called The Block where they were trying to build a school, but now the school was not built at the end.  We got to The Block on a Sunday at about quarter to seven.  It was myself as well as other members of the community.  As we were still talking the criminals approached.  They were a large group.  When they got to us I said we should choose one person who was going to talk to them because we were not supposed to talk all of us.  They said I am the one who was supposed to talk, and I approached this big group and asked them as to whether we could help them.  They said they had come to the meeting, and we told them that this meeting was for specific people, and it was not meant for them because it was a meeting for people who were sent letters to attend the meeting.  And I told them they should go back to their places and tell their parents that there was a meeting and it was not a meeting for the youths.  They went back.  And the people were angry at that time.  They were asking as to why we had left these youths to come and control us, we should have dealt with them accordingly.  And from there people decided that they wanted to fight.  They went to fetch their weapons and they started assaulting the youths.  They chased the youths up to Iscor, and on that day - it was on a Sunday - these criminals were assaulted.  Thereafter there was an investigating policeman called Malinga.  He said he was sent by Major Mthethwa, because Major Mthethwa had heard that there were certain people who were dissatisfied, and these people should stay in that meeting, they should not leave, they should wait for him.  He ultimately came, and he said that he wants these people to be told.  He said these people should elect a leader who was going to be a spokesperson for them, because he could not speak to all of them, and he did not want them to speak so they must elect a leader.  They chose a leader, because he said he didn't want to speak to everybody, he wanted to speak to one responsible person.  And the major came.  He asked as to whether Malinga had told us.  Malinga said yes, and he asked as to who the leader was.  They said they had chosen Dlamini.  He said they had chosen Dlamini.  He said they had chosen a person who fits the position.",

            "  I was attacked by Inkatha at night.  It was at about quarter past one in the morning.  I never saw the people who attacked me, but I saw one of them, because at the time that they came I woke up and I peeped through the window and I could see one of them.  It was a person I knew.  It was J C Msibi, and J C Msibi was leading the people and they were standing alongside my window.  And J C put something down.  I could not see what he was putting down.  And he went back, he went onto the fence, and he cut my fence and came back and locked the door from the outside.  And he picked whatever he was picking up.  Apparently these were petrol bombs, and he started throwing the petrol bombs.  The petrol bomb went in through the window and it hit the floor.  There was a carpet on the floor and the petrol bomb hit the carpet, but it did not break.  It was a bit bottle, a litre.  He threw in another litre and it also hit the carpets, it never broke.  When he realised that he was not being successful he said something to his followers and they started taking out guns.  And they started shooting for quite some time at my house.  There was a fridge, a very big fridge, a double-door fridge, and I used this fridge as a shield.  And they shot the fridge so many bullets - it had so many bullets.  The bullets were coming from all directions, but it was only one bullet that hit me.  It hit me on the leg, on the foot.  That is the only bullet that hit me.  There was a female in the house, and that person is the one who got injured.  She was shot in both arms, the left as well as the right arm, and the leg as well, and she was amputated on the right leg.  That's how she got injured.",

            "  After we had been shot there came some members of the community, as well as neighbours.  They had come to see whether we had survived the attack.  We were taken to the hospital.  It was at night when we got to the hospital.  I think it was at about 2.00 am.  When we got to the hospital just as we were getting in we also saw Warrant-Officer Nkabinde.  He asked me as to whether I was surprised.  He asked me whether I wanted to open a case.  I said it was still too early because I had just been injured.  I think he knew about my attack, he was also involved.  Immediately thereafter I saw Dr Mdlalose.  Dr Mdlalose also came to see us, but I was surprised as to why he had come to see us, because I wanted to give a picture of Dr Mdlalose that I knew him very well.  I was surprised when I was shot and Dr Mdlalose never came to me to see that I was shot, but he went to the female who was with me and he interrogated her and asked her some questions.  As I have haven't got the time to talk about Dr Mdlalose, Dr Mdlalose went to open a case after we had fought.  We fought on a Saturday and Msibi went to speak to Mdlalose.  Whatever he did Msibi always went to Mdlalose, and Mdlalose would act on the basis of the information that he got from Msibi.  Even if Msibi would get a policeman who was on the phone he would grab the phone and said he was talking to Ulundi, and he would never be arrested.  And Mdlalose opened up a case against me.  He opened up a case because he said I had gone to a meeting that was convened by him where they were going to choose a branch leader or a region leader.  When I got to the meeting I went to Mdlalose and told him that people were being killed at section 7.  They were being finished by a certain Mr Msibi, and whenever we spoke to Msibi, Msibi would tell us that he was an untouchable because he was under Mdlalose's wing.  So I told Mdlalose that he was Msibi's protector.  Then he said that wing was Ulundi, and Mdlalose seemed to be surprised by this revelation.  Mdlalose called R M Shabalala in that very same meeting.  He also called D A Bhengu, as well as Mthethwa.  There were about eight people that he called, and he said I should repeat what I had said to him and repeat it to the whole group.  And he reiterated my statement and said that they were being troubled by Ulundi.  And he said to Mthethwa the following morning at eight on Monday there should be a meeting where we were all going to meet, the eight of us, and they were going to thrash out this issue.  The meeting was adjourned.  The following day at eight we got to the police station.  I was with about 400 people who heard that Mdlalose had called me.  They said they wanted to go there and hear as to what was going to be discussed.  Before we discussed the matters Shabalala R M got in, and he was followed by two other people, his son as well as another man.  When he got in through the door Mdlalose called to him and asked him as to who was accompanying him.  Shabalala said,\"It's my father as well as my son.  They were called by me.\"  He asked them as to why they had come.  Mdlalose said, \"We do not need any witnesses.  Mdlalose said Shabalala was hijacking his meeting.  He said he was calling the meeting and he was hijacking it, and he said if he wanted he could also call his own witnesses to come and give testimony.  He went out and said he was handing the meeting over to Shabalala, and Mdlalose went out to report to the police that I should be arrested.  On that day I was arrested.  When all the people went out the police kept on looking for me and they arrested me. ",

We know that you wanted to tell us a much, much longer story, but as Mr Lax pointed out we still have a number of witnesses who have come here today.  Some of them have come from a long way, and we are not able to allow people to go on for too long.  You have told us the experiences which took place in - way back in 1972 and 1973, when the police attempted to get you to work for them, the Security Police, and one of the reasons why the police, and particularly the Security Branch, in this country were so successful is that they were able to persuade or force some black people to work for them, and to your credit you refused to do this, and by this you avoided being taken into that world which is inhabited by people like Mamasela and Nofumela and Chikalanga.  These were people who spied on opponents of apartheid, and killed them on the orders of the police.  And, going further, to your experiences in the eighties and nineties, it seems that your unwillingness to support the IFP and participate in its institutions after having been a member was the reason why you were subjected to harassment and attack, which resulted in the very terrifying attack on your house and the shooting of you and your wife, your common-law wife.\nYou have also mentioned the name of Mr Themba Nkabinde, who was an IFP youth leader, who was also mentioned by the previous witness, Mrs Madela, as being the person possibly responsible for her husband's death.  And you have also given us a very vivid description of the activities of the organisation that was known as Savuka at the time, and its links with the IFP youth.\nSo, in conclusion, we want to thank you for filling us in on what happened in Madadeni in those days.  We have to write a report to the State President, to the Government, at the end of our period of work, and the information that you have given us is valuable for that report.  And you have given us the names of people who you believe perpetrated violations against you, and it is our job through our investigation unit to take those investigations further and to try and find out who did those things and why they did them, and your information has been very valuable.

            "  I would like to start by saying I am a member of ANC.  I was a member of executive committee for ANC Youth League.  I was an organiser.  What happened is that after I left - I had received some threats from Inkatha that they will kill me.  I knew why they wanted to kill me.  That was because Inkatha and ANC never saw one eye.  Police, ZP, were always for Inkatha, they didn't like ANC.  In 1993 we were harassed all of us ANC members and supporters at Madadeni.  We were harassed.  This went on until in 1993 one day, it was late at night, I think it was about half past eight - comrades at that time, ANC comrades, never used to sleep home because they were scared, so they used to run away.  Up until today there are a lot of cases which were opened and they were never investigated.  One day I went and visited a friend opposite the street opposite mine in section 5.  I am staying from section 2.  As I was approaching section 5 I saw a group of people who were coming, and I just didn't think that those people were Inkatha supporters or Inkatha members so I kept on walking.  When I reached to this group of people, I think it was just a distance of a metre, I stopped and then they also stopped.  I didn't pass them.  When we were facing each other one person said, \"Here's Mandela's dog.\"  I didn't even want to take an interest.  One person chopped me at the head.  At that time I saw a person, in fact three people who were talking to someone in a police car.  It was an NP Cressida and a blue Golf.  Those cars belonged to ZPs.  This blue Golf was parked there, and I saw - I realised that those policemen who were driving that Golf were the very same police who warned me that they were going to kill me, so I realised that I was going to die.  I went to one house nearby.  As I was running that Golf turned and then they started shooting at me.  One bullet went through my hand and one through my back.  And then they thought the gates of that house were locked.  They left and they were laughing.  At that time the comrades heard and then they started following them.  Police as well followed Inkatha supporters and left them somewhere where Inkatha used to go, or to take someone who wasn't supporting them to that area.  That's where they used to kill people who were not supporting them.  In that house I asked one lady who was renting there, I asked her to go and tell my parents that I have got hurt.  So they came, they brought a car, they took me to hospital.  When we were going to hospital there was a blue Conquest which used to be driven by Inkatha people, and there were also two cars, and the driver tried to get away and we went up until to the hospital.  One car that was following us left us there.  And then in hospital they stitched me, they gave me stitches.  What I told the people in the hospital is that I don't want to be admitted and sleep over there because it wasn't safe in that hospital.  Even the security guards were scared of Inkatha, so Inkatha used to come to that hospital.  So I left, I refused to be admitted.  And Comrade Mbele came and Comrade Mboyisa.  They took me.  They didn't take me home, because at home at that time police were around the house, so things were really bad.  I went to 16 section, where I had a girlfriend whom I had a child with.  The ZPs used to arrest people who were not Inkatha people and tell them that they were accusing them of things that they didn't know.  They came, they were driving a Golf.  They said they were looking for me because I was involved in a certain offence.  So the nurses at hospital told them that I wasn't there.  In 1994 Inkatha came to my house.  They attacked my house, they broke windows, and the ZPs were there.  I even know the KwaZulu Police who shot me, because one of them told me that he's Bravusi, and he's from Durban to kill me.  Now they aren't driving that Golf, they are driving other cars, but they are still around.  That Golf disappeared.  Even that Cressida, that white Cressida, disappeared.  We don't know where they took those cars to.",

            "Mr Ntuli, thank you very much for coming to talk to us today.  Your evidence shows that right up to 1994 - 1993 and 1994 there were very similar patterns of behaviour taking place in Madadeni as were happening in 1986, and by this I mean the very close relationship between the KwaZulu Police and the IFP.  We have heard many, many stories like this all around KwaZulu-Natal, particularly from places like Port Shepstone, and also the townships around Durban, like KwaMashu, KwaMakutha, Umlazi, Ntuzuma.  In these areas the relationship between the KwaZulu Police and certain elements within Inkatha was very, very close, and it seems to us that it was a deliberate policy of that police force, the KwaZulu Police Force, to support and assist one side, the IFP, and to harass and detain and undermine members of the ANC.  The remark which you made about how you feel about the police is also very important and very revealing.  Many young people like yourself have got a lot of suspicion and mistrust and hatred for the police, and this is understandable, but it's also very problematic, because we're now moving into a new era where there is ongoing transformation of the police force into a community police force, and in many areas of this country the police are dedicated to assisting the community and upholding the law.  However, there are also areas of this country, particularly here in this province, KwaZulu-Natal, where there has not been that same degree of transformation, and there is still a lot of suspicion between communities and the police.  However, we at least do have a sympathetic ministry, and it is very important that any biased behaviour by the police should be reported immediately to structures like the Peace Accord and the Community Policing Forums so that this sort of behaviour on the part of the police can finally disappear.\nWe note from what you have said that you have been disabled to a certain degree by the shooting, and that it seems as though you lost your job in the Defence Force from that shooting, and it is our job to make recommendations to the Government as to how people like you could be assisted, and we will be making those recommendations on your behalf.  So we thank you very much for coming to tell us your story today.  It gives us a clear picture of what life was like for young activists like yourself right up to 1993, and that information will go into our report.  Thank you very much.",

As I was just sitting there on top of the dustbin I heard an explosion just nearby, and I stood up and I wanted to go and see as to what was happening, but I saw nothing.  And at that time the senior public prosecutor approached - I think it was Macintosh if I can remember quite well - and he said I should move away from the dustbin because he wanted to look inside.  He checked inside the dustbin and he could not find anything.  Then I sat on top of the dustbin.  After quite some time I heard another explosion and I could not see.  I thought I was running, but when everything had cleared up I realised that I had fallen just next to the dustbin, and I just saw some bricks falling from the wall and they were falling on top of me, and I tried to manoeuvre myself to move away from the falling bricks and I realised that I had been injured on the legs.",

I said to him what was going on, what did he do.  The only explanation that they gave  me is that he was terrorist.  I went there the next day.  I had his jersey with me.

            " After I came back from that police station where Mthunzi was police came to me and my mother.  They told us we were needed to go to the police station because they wanted to take a statement from us.  And they were asking us questions, even though I cannot remember those questions very well.   And then they took us back home again.  When Mthunzi was supposed to appear in court they never told me that he was appearing in court until I heard when he was appearing for the second time.  One person told me if I knew that Mthunzi was appearing in court, and I said no.  And then I went there, and in that case the case was transferred to 'Maritzburg.  In 'Maritzburg that's where I used to go for his case.  He stayed there and then he was sent to Robben Island.  Even there also I tried to make money to go to Robben Island and visit him.  I went there.  I went there for the second time.  The third time I couldn't.  When he was released it was in April 1991.  He stayed only four months with me and he was killed.  What really made me feel so bad and sad is that there was no one who came to me to tell me that, \"There was your child lying on the street dead,\" but when my child was arrested police came and asked me that I am the mother, I should come and make a statement.  But now the very same police who saw him being stoned - everyone saw because it wasn't that late at night.  People who knew me they never came and tell me this.  And people who knew him they saw that he was being killed, but no one came and told me.  ZP took him there late, and took him to hospital.  They knew who he was and where was he from, but they never bothered.  He used to tell me whenever he leaves, or to tell me what time he'll be back.  A week before he died we received a telephone early in the morning before I left for work, and this telephone said - this person said to me, \"Do you know the person from Sithole family who is dead?\"  And I said, \"Sithole who?\"  And they said a person from Sithole family, and I asked them, \"Who are you?\"  They said, \"We are police.\"  I contacted an ANC president.  I think his name is Makhosini Hadebe.  I asked him, \"Do you know Mthunzi, or do you know where Mthunzi is?   Is Mthunzi with you?\"   And then he said, \"No, Mthunzi is not with me, but I trust he is somewhere with his girlfriend.\"  And then I said to Makhosini, \"Makhosini, I leave this matter on your hands.  Now you can do.\"  And then later at work they called me, they told me, \"Don't worry because here he is, he is with us.\"  The following week on the 14th on Saturday he was from my aunt's funeral.  2 o'clock after work I met him at the gate.  That was the last time I saw my son.  He said to me he was going to see his aunt.  My sister told me that my son left early, and because he left early people didn't know who was being killed there.  But I still believe that this was someone's aim that he should be killed and no one should say anything.  Late in the evening he couldn't call, and I got worried because he used to call.  I went to my neighbour the next day.  I told my neighbour that, \"I can't see my child and he is",

Initially he called the police, and then police from Madadeni told him that he is not in their custody.  And then Makhosini called again, and then the police said, \"There is a person that we took from one farm called Jugglers(?), and we didn't know who he was.\"  Makhosini went to Newcastle, and when he came back to Madadeni he brought a box.  Inside this box there were his clothes full of blood, and he was in the mortuary now, lying there dead.  At about half past four Sihle left, and then came back with one shoe, and then he said to me, \"Mum, don't you think is Mthunzi's shoe?\"   And then I said, \"Oh, maybe he was running,\" and I only discovered after a while that the shoe was left where he was being killed.

As I said to the previous witness, Sergeant Nene, there were many young people who, in their anger about apartheid, they often did irresponsible things which resulted in their being sent to prison, and your son did something in terms of which he felt he was making a statement against the system that was prevailing at the time.  He was a very young person at the time, and he was arrested and he was sentenced for this, and he spent some time, as you have told us, on Robben Island, where you visited him twice and learned from him why he did what he did.  He served his sentence and he came home, and we have learnt how sad it must have been for you that he was only with you for four months before he died.\nNow, you've described to us the circumstances under which he died, and it is clear that you are not satisfied with those circumstances, and from what you have told us -without looking at the court record, but from what you have told us, it does seem suspicious, and it is possible that he was taken to that place and he was deliberately killed.  We don't know that, but I am sure that is what you want us to investigate, to find out the real circumstances under which he died, and we will try and do that.  We have an investigative unit, and we will try and take those steps and see if we can find out what really happened there.  \nWith regard to yourself and your personal circumstances, we will make recommendations to the Government as to how we think that you should be assisted.
