There are many things that our Committee did.  Maybe amongst other things I would point out that its main function was to fight for the rights to  obtain land, then when we got these rights we tried to develop the place.  Our Committee was comprised of the owners of the land, as well as tenants or people who leased the land.  Everybody in the community was involved.  Everybody was accepted, was welcomed, but there were some hitches that took place in other places whereby other people did not like that our Committee should be involved in developing Trust Feeds.  Then they tried to form an opposing group which was led by Mr Jerome Gabela, who was a chairman of the Inkatha in Trust Feeds.  This is the new committee that was formed which caused the harassment as well as the cracks in the community.  They were calling themselves as the Committee of the Owners of the Land.  May I just point out that it was on two occasions now that Gabela had tried to form a group, so that he would form this group which would oppose our group, but our community rejected all his efforts.  But on the third occasion he was able to form, and he didn't form it within Trust Feeds, he went outside and went to Emshuwathi Court.  That is where he started forming this group.",

Their wishes were that whatever development we tried to create must come to an end, and it mustn't be given to the Crisis Committee, because it was believed that the Crisis Committee is a committee of communists, therefore whatever development there is mustn't be given to them.  Now, as Gabela was working with the police, but the main problem that he had was that the community just could not accept or follow him.  They did not believe in his ideologies.  There were so many questions coming from the people that ever since the Inkatha has been there in Trust Feeds what has he done for the community?  There were problems, floods in 1987, and many houses were destroyed, but he did absolutely nothing.  It was our Committee that worked with Poinant in 'Maritzburg, as well as Red Cross, as well as another organisation, Islamic organisation, as well as the superintendent in Hanover.  At that time he was still Warrant-Officer Nicholas.  They helped people to try and rebuild their houses, get food as well as whatever they needed.

Some of them were members of the Government of KwaZulu who used to come, as well as with chiefs.  But they were not staying at Trust Feeds, they were coming from outside places.  Some were coming from Dalton, people we didn't know.  Maybe I can point a few who were members of the Government.  It was Ben Jele, who was from Imbali, Psychology Ndlovu from Zwaiman(?), as well as VV Mvelase.  These were the people who came into our meeting and they said the Crisis Committee were just people who deserved to be killed.  Those words came from Ben Jele's mouth.

Up til the 23rd there were continuous attacks almost every day.  But now we realised that we had had enough, because we could not fight during the day because the police used to be there to accompany the attackers, so that when we fought they would be able to take our ammunition so that they might attack us even more.  On the 23rd I was from work.  I am working at Sobantu at the school, I am a teacher.  I was accosted by police.  The police arrested me.  I was with some other gentlemen.  We were seven in all.

According to my knowledge in that meeting they came to a resolution.  There were police, special police who were brought in, and they were put at Trust Feeds to do that job.  They were placed at certain houses.  That was Gabela's place as well as Ndlovu's place, but they were not placed at Johan Nxumalo's place because his house is next to my house.

It is clear from what is now common knowledge about the Trust Feeds Massacre that the primary reasons for this tragic incident were, (1) to attempt to enforce the policies of the previous government of homeland consolidation, and, (2) to ensure the dominance in that area by leading figures in the  Inkatha Freedom Party.  It is interesting that this pattern took place in many other areas of this province.  Evidence was given at the Durban hearings of the Truth Commission of the attempts made by the former Deputy Minister of the Interior of the KwaZulu Government, Mr Jamile Mlotshwa, to have Clermont township incorporated into the KwaZulu homeland.  This lead to the death of many prominent citizens of Clermont, and the subsequent imprisonment for life of the Deputy Minister, Mr Jamile, who was subsequently released by the previous government after serving less than two years in prison.  On the other hand Captain Brian Mitchell is still in prison.\nIt is also significant to note that in both these cases the investigating officers of the South African Police were Mr Frank Dutton and his assistant, Mr Wilson Magadla.\nThe Trust Feeds Massacre shocked the community and shocked the country as well, because it was one of the first occasions when it was shown that senior members of the South African Police were actively involved in destabilisation of communities and murder.  \nYou have played an important part today in exposing and publicising this tragedy, and we thank you for coming and telling us what you have told us.  Your a lucky person, because it is clear that it was you and your family who were targeted for assassination on that night of 3rd December.  Instead of you and your family 11 people, many of them women and children, were shot down in cold blood whilst praying at a funeral vigil.  \nIt is clear from what you have told us that you have suffered financially, and we shall be making  recommendations to the Government as to how you, and other\npeople like you, should be assisted.  So we thank you once again for coming in and telling us your story, and we wish you well.  Thank you very much.  Sorry, one question from Dr Mgojo.",

As Mrs Gcabashe has already said that you were a very young person at the time this took place, especially that you were a female.  We have spoken to quite a few females who told us about their torture and harassment.  One more important thing that we are going to take as the Rehabilitation Committee and pass forward is that you lost your youth.  If you say you were 13 years at that time that this took place, you were tortured, shot, harassed, taken to a prison for old people, even appeared in court for old people.

            " We travelled then, the three of us, to Ixopo in my car, which was a blue Golf.  I was driving, Reggie was sitting next to me in the passenger seat, and Shaiks was sitting in the back.  We arrived at Ixopo and then went to the Anglican Church, where the meeting was meant to be taking place.  We met local members of the ANC at the meeting, in particular Mr Magubane, who was chair of the ANC in Ixopo.  There were also members of the IFP, in particular a Chief Dlamini who, as far as I recall, was a member of the KwaZulu Cabinet.  I think he was Deputy Minister of Agriculture, and Chief Khawula Ngwenya Mkhize.  There were also members of the police.  Eventually the meeting started at about 11 o'clock.  There was some delay because Dennis Nkosi from the Regional Peace Committee was late in arriving.  When the meeting started there were some problems in that Chief Dlamini arrived in the meeting with three men, young men in their 20s.  They introduced themselves as Luthingo, Luthuli or Ntuli, I can't remember which, and Mabaso, and they said they were his security.  The altercation was over whether they should be in the meeting or not, and eventually Chief Dlamini agreed that they should go out.  The altercation was really over that it wasn't usual for people to bring security guards or bodyguards into peace meetings.  The first item on the agenda was freedom of political association in the areas around Ixopo under local chiefs.  Chief Dlamini opposed discussion on the issue on the basis that not all local chiefs were present, and after discussion on the point it became apparent that the meeting could not proceed, and the meeting was then adjourned to a date in the future.  That was at approximately 12 o'clock.  The ANC had indicated that it wished to have a meeting with the police to discuss a memorandum that had been given in to the police some time before, and that meeting then, after a short break, commenced.  The issues that I remember discussing were, in particular, the question of the G3 firearms that were present in the Ixopo area, that a number of the associates of the chiefs had been given G3 weapons, and these were being used in the commission of crimes.  As far as I recall the police response was that they couldn't really do much about it.  And the police we were meeting with - from what I remember it at least one of the people was the district commissioner of Kokstad at that stage.  Ixopo fell under the Kokstad police district.  The meeting then adjourned, that meeting, second meeting, then adjourned shortly before lunch, and Reggie, Shaiks, myself, Mehmout Peer, who was from the ANC locally, and Mr Magubane, and there may have been a few other people, then went to lunch at the local hotel.  Over lunch Reggie told me that Chief Mkhize had spoken to him during the break and had told him that he didn't like peace meetings, that he was still filled with hatred, and that he now knew Reggie, or words to that effect.  Reggie interpreted those words as a threat.  Just after two we then proceeded from Ixopo back to 'Maritzburg along the main road.  We were seated as we had arrived at the meeting.  That was myself driving, Reggie in the front passenger seat, and Shaiks sitting in the back.  In the car we were talking and joking and sort of having quite a lively conversation.  We crossed over the Umkomaas River.  There's a big valley with the Umkomaas River at the bottom on the way between Ixopo and Richmond.  There's a steep drive down to the river and a steep drive up on the other side.  So we went through this valley, we crossed over the river, and were proceeding up the hill on the other side.  At one point there's a hairpin bend and a low concrete wall on the left-hand side of the road.  As we were driving past this area there was a very loud bang.  It sounded as though it was very close.  My first reaction was not knowing what was going on, but immediately after that there were a number of shots, or the sound of a number of shots that were being fired, and were obviously being fired at the car, and I then realised that we were being fired at.  While the shots were being fired, or throughout the whole period, I continued driving.  Because it was a steep part and a bending part in the road it was difficult to accelerate or move much faster.  Whilst the shots were being fired I noticed that Reggie was lying with his head on my leg.  At that point I assumed he was ducking for cover.  Shaiks also remarked that he had been hit, and that I must try and drive faster.  Eventually we got out from the shooting - it seemed to carry on for a long time - and at that point I noticed that Reggie had been shot in the top of his neck and appeared to be badly injured.  I was not aware at that stage that he was dead.  I then drove as fast as possible to Richmond, where I thought there was a hospital.  At some point on the road to Richmond the back windscreen of the car fell out because it had been hit by bullets.  When I got to Richmond I went to the Richmond Chest Hospital - I thought that was an ordinary hospital, but it was only a TB hospital - and tried to get assistance.  There were some difficulties in that there were only nurses there.  They didn't seem to be that willing to give assistance.  Eventually we got them to examine Reggie, but that took some time - they wanted to put on gloves and things - and they then said that he was dead.  They didn't want to move Shaiks.  Shaiks had received a wound in the back.  They didn't want to move him as they were worried about whether moving him might cause further problems.  I asked them to call a doctor and to call an ambulance.  No doctor arrived, but eventually an ambulance arrived, and the ambulance drivers just took Shaiks out of the car and put him in the ambulance.  There was then a further argument in that the ambulance was wanting to take Shaiks to Edendale Hospital, and Shaiks and I didn't feel that that was safe, we wanted him to go to Greys Hospital.  The ambulance drivers, however, refused to take Shaiks to Greys, and said if they took him there Greys would just refer him to Edendale.  So I got Shaiks to come back into my car.  Reggie was still in the car at that stage.  There was a local Comrade who I knew who was at the hospital, and he came with us and I then drove to 'Maritzburg, intending to go to Greys.  Driving into 'Maritzburg there were too many traffic lights on Alexander Road that I was going through, so I went to Medicity, which is the nearest hospital.  And at that point Shaiks got treatment, and I contacted the police and the local ANC office.  I believe that Reggie was killed with the first shot, the loud bang that had been fired, and I believe that he was killed instantly in that he didn't make any noise or any movement.",

We had been specifically interested in Chief Dlamini's security guards, because we felt their presence at the meeting was fairly suspicious.  The other pointers to make on the whole thing is that I do think it was a very carefully planned ambush, that they chose a spot in the road where vehicles have to proceed more slowly.  The spot was also one in which they were able to see all oncoming traffic and all - from both directions.  I think they must have had us under surveillance in Ixopo, because we didn't leave the meeting immediately, we had the meeting with the police and then we had lunch, and I am sure they wouldn't have wanted to have hung around on the road for a long time.  And then also that the shot that killed Reggie I think must have come from an expert marksman to have been able to hit him like that.  The other point I didn't mention was I was not able to see anybody, so when we neared the spot I didn't see any vehicles or any people before the ambush took place.

The rear window was broken.  Bullets went through that.  A bullet hole in the front dash board above the steering wheel, and then a number of bullet holes in the car, so it was a large number.  As far as I know it was - shotguns were used.  There were pellets.  As far as I understand Reggie was killed with an R4, I think, a bullet, and there were then other bullets on the car.",

One of the problems is that many of those people are still in the police.  Barber, who was mentioned quite a lot with regard to Imbali, is still  in the Security Police.  I think it's the Prime Intelligence Service now.  He currently holds the rank of inspector.  And that I don't think people's relations with the police can ever improve unless the people being named are properly investigated.  I don't see how people can be expected to have faith in the police when - or in the Security Police for example, of the new police, South African Police Service, when people like Barber are still there and there don't appear to have been any proper investigations into what he allegedly did.  But I think it goes beyond the foot soldiers, as it were.  The more senior police, the head of security, the heads of security at that time need also to come and say what they did, what they knew of what was going on, were they aware of abuses, what steps did they take.  Similarly the heads of CID, because one of the problems with number of the violence cases was that they were not properly investigated.  Those heads need to come and tell people their understanding of what happened and why these case were not properly investigated, why there were so few people arrested and charged, and so few people found guilty of the crimes.  And I think that unless that's done I don't think anyone can really expect relations between the police and the community in Pietermaritzburg and surrounding areas to normalise, and for the community to have faith in the police.",

There was another lady who was staying in Mbabane in Swaziland.  We used to go to her place.  I think it was on the 3rd, but I am not sure, but I think it was the 3rd, I was taken to No 8, a flat, where there was a granny who was staying there.  Her name was Alzina Zondi.  I was very close to Alzina Zondi.  I almost thought she was my mother.  I had visited there.  There was her granddaughter.  Her name was Nokuthula.  We were attending school at Malcolmville.  I was going to sleep there, and wake up the following morning and go to school together with her.  In the morning my mother was supposed to come and fetch me together with Nokuthula so that they put us in a school bus which would leave us at school.  I waited on that particular day, myself and Nokuthula, waiting for my mother.  That was on the 4th.  I was in grade one.  I waited and waited with Nokuthula.  And Alzina said to us, \"It looks like your parents are not coming to fetch you.\"  I told Alzina that they should be here because they knew I had problems with my school bus.  We waited endlessly until such time that they sent us to the shop.  When we were sent to the shop we were still in uniform.  When we came back from the shop I saw my sisters as well as other children with whom we board the school bus.  I asked what had happened, whether the bus had broken down.  Nobody answered me.  I asked who had died, \"Because all of you just look downhearted.\"   I asked, \"Who did the boers kill?\" because this boer things was now a joke, because they used to say, \"Boers are dogs, when ever they get you they kill you.\"  I sensed that there was something bad that had happened.  Ntombenhle and Lindiwe was there, but Philani was at the creche.  I think my sisters will go further from then, because they never told me what was happening, they just kept quiet.

When I got there my mother's car had burnt down.  I could not see what had happened.  My mother was not there.  We were very confused.  I asked myself as to why my mother wasn't left at home.  I heard that as the car was standing when my father tried to start the car, because my mother sent Ntombenhle to change Philani, the baby, her napkin, so my mother said she must start the car.  Then when my father started the car the car just exploded.  The flat at which we were staying was even having a big hole at the ceiling.  Lindiwe, my sister, ran out and she called Ntombenhle's name, and they realised that the parents had died.  When she came close my father's lower part was no longer there.  He was bleeding profusely.  My mother had her foot inside and the other one was outside.  She was trying to get into the car.  Now she was burnt and her skull had started to crack.

It must make it even harder for you to bear.  As I have said before, it has so often been the women of this country who have suffered most during the past 30 years of our history, and you are one of those women.\nYou have also told us something about what was happening in the Taylors Halt area and the Khaluzi area at the time, and that is important for us in drafting our report which we have to give to the Government.  You have gone to great lengths to try and find your son.  You have looked for him for three years, and we cannot promise you that we will be successful in finding your son.  We will certainly investigate whether it was Mr Ndlovu who killed your son, so that if this is the case that he can be prosecuted.  \nAnd, as my colleague Dr Magwaza has said, that if you feel that you need other assistance, psychological assistance, so that you can come to terms with your son's disappearance, you must not hesitate to contact the Commission.\nWe thank you very much for coming to us and telling us your sad story.

            "  It was in the morning on the 17th of May in 1990.  I was working at Town Hill.  My husband used to take me to and from work whenever I was on duty, and he would fetch me from work and take me back home.  On this particular day he left me at work.  He said he would come and fetch me in the afternoon.  At about half past nine, still in the morning, the sister in charge in the ward called me in.  I went to her.  She told me that I was needed at the office.  I asked them what the matter was.  She said I should go and hear what was going to be said at the office.  I proceeded there.  As I was approaching the door I saw the matrons also coming towards me.  Then Matron Newman held my hand.  She took me inside the office.  As I got into the office I looked around.  I saw Virginia.  Virginia is my husband's sister's child.  She was with Doris Shabalala.  I panicked.  I asked Virginia as to what she was doing there.  She didn't look at me in the eye.  I asked as to whether my husband had been killed because he had been getting death threats over the phone.  Virginia kept quiet, she didn't answer me.  The matron tried to calm me down.  I told them to tell me if my husband had been killed.  Virginia said, \"Yes, they have killed your husband.\"  I asked where he died.  She told me that he died in his kombi at Umlahlankosi.  I got very confused.  The matron tried to calm me down.  They took me and put me into a kombi.  We went to Imbali.  As I was just approaching Imbali there's a downslope as you approach.  I saw the roof of my kombi, and there were many people there gathered.  Then I tried to look and see, because the kombi hadn't yet stopped.  As soon as the kombi stopped I got out.  When I got out I slipped and fell.  They lifted me up.  I ran towards the kombi.  He was inside the kombi.  When I was still on my way there the police came and tried to restrain me.  They started hitting me with the backs of their guns, trying to shove me backwards.  I went backwards.  They said I mustn't get any nearer.  I asked them, \"How could I not come closer to my husband, because I want to see that he's really dead?\"  The other one - there was a short one, a boer, who shoved me with the back of the gun.  I fell down and sat down.  As I was sitting there I looked around and I saw this kombi.  I saw that where it was standing the kombi had tilted a bit.  I said they must try and get some rods to balance the kombi so that it can be straight.  They refused.  At that time the people were very angry and they said, \"We are going to get some rods.\"  They went to look for these poles to support the kombi, because it was standing on its side.  When I looked at the windows all the windows were shattered, as well as the windscreen.  The only window that was left was the rear window.  I just sat there dumbfounded.  Then later on we saw the hearse coming.  It had come to fetch my husband.  I think by now it was at about 1 o'clock.  I stood up because I wanted to go and see my husband.  They said I mustn't get any nearer.  I was told by the police.  They said I mustn't get any nearer.  One person came to whisper in my ear and told me that my husband was killed by Nathi.  At that time I was very confused.  They ran into Jerome's place and they changed their gear, whatever they were wearing.  Jerome was also driving a car.  I don't remember whether it was a Toyota or what.  Then he collected these men who had killed my husband.  Then the police were alerted and told that the people who had just killed my husband were now running away.  The police never chased them, they just stood guard on the corpse.  They took my husband and put him into the hearse.  When I tried to come and have a look they chased me away.  They said I must go back.  If I want to see my husband I will go and see him at Modderbly(?).  I started crying, and I was worried and concerned as to what transport we were going to use to go and see my husband.  The police refused us permission to take the kombi.  They said the kombi was supposed to be taken to the police station.  I refused.  I wanted the kombi to be taken home.  We ultimately took the kombi home.  There was a support group at that time comprised of Monica, as well as other women.  We stayed there until it was late, until the following day.  There was no policeman who came to my house to ask me about my husband or to tell me anything about my husband.  I started talking to my daughter, who was at the university.  I said they must go and tell my daughter that her father had died.  I hired a car.  They had fetched the one who was at Ndumiso and they had fetched even the other ones who were married.  I stayed there.  Just as it was getting dark they had brought this one from the university.  When she got in she said, \"What has happened?  What did my father die?  What did he do to deserve such death?\"  We sat in there, as well as the support group.  Thereafter we prepared for the funeral.  I heard rumour that Inkatha said I mustn't bury my husband at Mountain Rise, I must go and bury my husband at Emnambithi, because that's where he was born.  I told them that my husband will not be buried in Emnambithi, he was going to be buried at Mountain Rise.  Everything else that will happen thereafter I am well prepared for it, because I don't care any more.  We continued to prepare for the funeral.  We went to bury him at Mountain Rise.  The people in Mountain Rise - Jerome died on the 16th.  That is the Inkatha member.  My husband died on the 17th.  They told me that we, the Ngcobo family, should go and bury in the morning at about 12.  We were not supposed to bury at the same time, because Inkatha and UDF were at loggerheads.  It happened like that.  We went to Methodist Church, because that is where we attend church at Imbali.  That's where the funeral procession was.  People were so many.  The inspectors led us to Mountain Rise.  I don't know what happened when we came back because we were driving in front.  After we had buried my husband there came policemen.  It was towards dawn.  After we had buried on Saturday it was on a Tuesday.  They knocked at round about 1 o'clock.  They knocked, kicked the doors, and I asked who it was.  They told me we should open, they were the police.  I asked them what they were looking for.  They said they were looking for guns.  I asked them whether somebody had told them whether there were guns.  They started getting very violent and kicking the doors.  I told them I won't open the door for them because it was at night.  If they wanted guns they must come in the morning or during the day when everybody else could see them.  They started kicking the door, hitting it.  It ultimately opened.  They got inside, they started searching.  They turned the house upside-down.  They were asking who the owner of the house was, and the children pointed at me.  They were asking where my husband was.  I knew they knew that my husband had died, because one of the policemen who was there when my husband was killed was also there on that particular day.  I asked him, \"How come you come and ask me where my husband is, because you were present on that particular day when he died?\"  They went out and came back the following day.   When they came in they said they wanted to see my sons.  I told them that my sons were asleep, and I pointed to where my sons were sleeping.  When they got to my sons they started assaulting them.  As they were hitting Mandla they took him and put him into a van.  They told him to go and point out some guns because we were harbouring criminals in the house.  I told them that nobody was staying in the house, I was staying with my sons.  They took Mandla along.  It was towards dawn.  I think it was about half past one.  They took Mandla with.  We stayed the whole day not knowing where Mandla was.  At night Mandla came.  I asked him where he was coming from.  He said the policemen took him to Sekland(?), and I asked him what had happened.  He was swollen all over the face, and he said he had been tortured with a tube and he had been told that he must point out certain guns.  Ultimately they took the tube out and they told him to go home.  The most painful experience that I had was that they take a child, but when he was supposed to come back they just threw him in the street.  He had to come back all by himself.  I don't remember whether it was on a Saturday or Sunday.  Thamsanqa, as well as his peers, were playing at the neighbour's place.  We heard a gunshot.  I asked as to which direction was this gunshot coming from.  Then there came a little boy who came to tell me that Thami had been shot.  Then they said Thami didn't die.  They had shot him in the stomach and the bullet came through the arm.  I just couldn't go out at that time, I felt very numb.  Thami was taken by a certain car.  The car couldn't start and people were trying to push it.  Just at that moment another gunshot went off.  Thami was taken to the hospital.  He was attended to.  He stayed four or five days.  I am not sure any more.  Thami came back.",

As he was just about to start searching and investigating the matter there came an Inkatha man or Inkatha member from Gaza.  This man said he had come to tell the police about how Ngcobo died.  When the police listened to him according to Nxumalo this man said Mr Ngcobo got to the hostel next to Mr Jerome's place.  He took the children.  I have grandchildren who are staying there, so my husband went to fetch these children.  That was on the 17th.  This boy said to us Nhlanhla, as well as other boys, they said they should take him and kill him at Umlahlankosi.  This is this Inkatha man now who was telling the police about the account.  When they got there they waited for my husband.  When my husband approached at Umlahlankosi they sent two girls.  They said to these girls they should stop the kombi as if they were hitching a hike.  They were also wearing school uniform.  These girls did exactly as they were told.  This was related by an Inkatha man.  At that time that's when they got a chance to kill my husband.  I asked them, now that they have got this information what was I supposed to do.  Then Nxumalo told me that they had already arrested Nhlanhla because he had told us where we would get Nhlanhla, and he also had the gun with which they killed my husband.  Nhlanhlazi was arrested.  Nxumalo went away.  A long time lapsed.  Nxumalo came back again.  He told me, \"Mrs Ngcobo, I have come to tell you that your husband's case has been finalised.\"  I think it was after about eight months.  As well as Nhlanhla had been acquitted because the Inkatha men had killed the witness.  They had already heard that he had made a statement to the police.  They killed the Gaza man or the Gaza boy, and that the matter had been dealt with because there were no witnesses.  That was the end.",

If I remember well it was Friday.  The warlords and the people sort of like gathered.  When you look at that sight it was like it was hiding like, because it was like a white cloud, and we can only hear some gunshots.  We get out and ran, and then they were coming down and there was the sounds of gun, and we went to the mountains and stand there.  We heard the sounds of guns and we ran to hide.  And we decided to run because it was dangerous at that time.  We ran to Sobantu on February.  We heard my mum, who was a grandmother to ... (inaudible) ... it was a big family so we have to separate.  Some ran to the farms.  Myself and my family we ran to Sobantu.  Nxobile, since he was working, he was working to some other place to his friend.  After some time like things passed we decided to come back.  When we arrived at home at about the end of March on the following week we have to bury him, and we decided to bury him as quick as possible because the warlords were about to meet again.  And we buried him - her during on Saturday.  On the burial day we were all there, but one of our family couldn't come because like there was a problem.  He couldn't come in, he was afraid of the people by his side.  Our children went to buy things to prepare for the funeral.  They saw some young people who were shot just in front of them.  That was the day of my mum's funeral.  Even at the burial service there were some people who were harassing us, because they were saying we are Comrades.  We slept at that day, and they told us that, \"We are just leaving you because you are burying.\"  They said, \"Your problem is that you are Comrades, you don't want to join the Inkatha.\"  Since I was the eldest it's the custom that I am the one who has to first wake up and go and wash.  I wake up and took a bath to wash, and outside there were some gunshots and they were saying like the Comrades should leave the place.  There were so many people coming.  And we all got out and started running to go and hide in the bushes.  And they were shooting.  While we were still hiding in the bushes we heard dogs.  The dogs were barking so they could find out where we were, but the young boys we didn't know where they were.  And Nxobile wasn't there at that time.  We thought he had gone to hide.  I thought then they better kill us because they could find out, the dogs were barking.  We get out of the bushes.  When we arrived at home there were a lot of bodies, dead bodies of Comrades.  We realised that we don't have a place to stay, we have to leave it like that and go away.  On Monday we tried to collect whatever was there.  On Tuesday we tried to organise for transport to run away.  My children went to another house and they were asked, \"Are you still here?  Haven't you run away?\"  They said they will stab your father and kill everybody.  \"All of you will be killed because you are Comrades.\"  From that date we didn't even sleep at home on that day.  We went to sleep somewhere called Amaromani(?).  We slept at there.  I think it's a Roman Catholic Church.  We couldn't collect all our belongings.  We just got whatever we were wearing because we were so very afraid at that time.  We travelled a long distance.  We went towards Cato Ridge, and then we took some transport and went to some relatives and we slept at our relatives.  The next morning we went to Sobantu.  We slept one day and we continued.  This was the place where they said all the people from Maqonqo must go there so that it can be said what we can do.  We sort of like missed our other relatives and the children because they took different paths when we were running, and they ended up in Gingingdlovu.",

We came back to this same forest where it had been pointed out by the witch doctor, together with the police.  As we were just there we talked to people who were working there, who had his workmen there.  We asked him to open the gate because the police wanted to get into the forest.  When the man tried to open the key got broken.  Then one of the workmen came.  He said, \"Don't force your way in because you can see that there is danger.\"  As we were still standing there we saw a green private car approaching.  There was one person inside.  This person came straight to us and he looked at us.  He even took out his glasses.  He had big eyes like saucers.  He looked at us and he started laughing, and he went back into the van.  As it was still like that we saw a boy.  This boy went past us.  He got in through a little hole there, because you could walk.  This boy kept on looking at us until he disappeared.  And this workman told us that we should no longer go into the forest because there might be danger.  Then the policemen took a turn.  We went to Duseni and we went towards SAB where they sell liquor.  When we got there we saw a head boy.  He was asked as to whether he never saw a corpse.  He said he never saw a corpse there.  From there we went away with the police and they took us back to the seminary, and they said they were going to ask Thoko.  Before that at the mortuary we went there about five times, and they were showing us decomposed bodies which were put in plastics, but we couldn't get Nxobile.  Each time we go they would tell us Nxobile is there, but when we get there he wasn't there.",

When I was rushing after them they started running away.  This Mncwabe man I wanted to cut his throat, but he was running so fast so that I couldn't catch him.  We came back and told my children, \"Oh, let's go back home.\"  And we just sat at home.  We thought this matter was over.   When I was running after him, and it looked as though one guy - one man was standing nearby who also wanted to stab me with a spear, and I just ducked and it happened that it had to sort of like went deep down into the ground.  And they come to ask me, \"How did you defeat them alone?  Where did you get the \"nthelezizi,\" the muthi that's used?\"  I said to them, \"Go and fetch all your arms and come back to me.  I am so tired of you I want to show you.  Don't you see where the thing started?  It started from where they said we must join Inkatha.\"  And all continued like that.  And my children, the other one have come back, and they said, \"We're coming to fetch you.\"  We went out, we were going to see the police, and then one man came.  There was this other one called Sikizo who used to shoot people around.  He was trying to shoot at us, but the bullets just go astray.  And they asked, \"How are these people just - I mean we can't hurt them.\"  I told my boys that, \"Okay, let's not go this way, let's walk on foot,\" and then we passed an Inkatha group.  They couldn't fight us because we were not armed, we were just walking.  We tried to report the case.  They were just laughing at us.",

They even tried to kill your son in hospital.  Tragically two of your sons died of being shot by these people, and another one of your sons was shot, but was lucky enough to survive.  The people who did these things were allowed to act with impunity in those days, and we hope that this sort of thing has now passed, although that can be of little comfort to you now.  You have also lost your house and your possessions.\nAs you have probably heard me and my fellow Commissioners and Committee Members say today, one of our jobs is to make recommendations to the Government as to how people like you should be assisted, and we will be making recommendations to the Government in due course.\nIn the meantime we thank you very much again for coming here and telling us your story, so that we have been able to get a far clearer picture of what it was like to live in Imbali in those day.

When they were shooting at us it sounded as if there were so many people shooting at us.  I raised up my head to see and I realised this time things were bad.  When I tried to wake up I realised they were shooting at me, and then I just ducked down, only to find that my wife has already realised that, and we all just lie down on the ground.  I tried to crawl on my stomach to the other room, and I tried to touch my children and call them.  I realised that they were also afraid.  I just pulled the sheet and all the clothes so that they can fall down without making any sound.  And I took them and put them under the bed.  And then they continued to fire.  They were firing at us.  At about - it was dawning in the morning and they stopped firing at our place.  In the morning I washed myself and I prepared myself to go to work.  While I was at my gate I saw Reverend Africaner.  He called me and said, \"Mr Zondi, please, your God is with you.  You did a good thing by not coming out while they were shooting, because if you did come out there was a red Husky outside there.  I think these people were waiting that if you get out of the house they can shoot you.\"  By luck I didn't get out of the house.  There was a way to get out, I could have got out, because I realised I cannot allow other men to kill me in my house.  I wanted to get out to make sure that - to fight before I die, so that if ever sometimes I could injure someone if ever it was possible for me to do that.  But because there was nothing in my house - although they used to come and say they were looking for arms in my house there was nothing, so I couldn't get out.   In all these instances have you ever reported any of them to the police?   ---   We didn't do anything, because I was now convinced that even if I go there they took sides.  I was just only going there if ever one of my child was arrested.  I was just waiting if ever it happens that they were arrested I will go to my lawyers.  One of them was Kajee.
