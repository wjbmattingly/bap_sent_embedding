I am going to start firstly on this - during 1990, March.  That specific time I was working at Security Branch.  On one day at one stage a certain man came, that's David Ntombela, and he came to speak to one of our superiors.  On that moment I couldn't specify who was that.  And he came to tell us that the ANC has blocked the road of the Edendale Road.  And our superior he told us we must out onto the area to patrol that area.  If I say our superior on that specific basis I refer to - he's a captain now at the moment, Captain Brookes.  We're doing the patrols during the time when he told us, and also the part of the people from the unit.  If I say the unit I specify the Riot Unit.  On that specific moment there was nothing happening there, and up to the stage on one day there was a bus coming from town going to Elandskop.  And there was a lady who was injured into that bus.  There was a youngster who was standing next to Mavulala bus stop, and he threw a stone into the bus.  And then on this stage we went to the scene and the specific man I was talking about, David Ntombela, told the bus must go into the N3 side.

Well, I followed them on the gravel road, the road leading into KwaShange.

By that time it was starting to be daylight.  You can see the people from far away this time.  And there's a gunshot was carrying on.  By the time the gunshot carried on then I saw a lot of houses was burnt down.  The house was burnt down by the special constables because they were running watch to these houses.
