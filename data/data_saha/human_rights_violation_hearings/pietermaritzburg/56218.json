I would just like to tell the Committee and the Chairperson that the murder case started in 1991 and did not arise from the Seven Day War.  The murder charge did not arise from the Seven Day War period.  I also request not to testify regarding the murder case since I have been told that my amnesty application will be heard early next year, and also because myself and my attorney still have to consult on this matter.  I also want to add that -before I start my evidence, that I gave my statement voluntarily to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's investigating officers without the benefit of any legal assistance.  I am therefore appearing before the Commission naked and humble today, and I am also appearing like that before the public.  My preparedness to testify must be seen as an indication of the willingness to be truthful, and also as a basis for my amnesty application.  I also want to apologise to the Commission because I would like to supplement the statement before you.  Perhaps I should explain what I mean.  After and during Mr Madlala's statement I realised that I should stop defending apartheid and the apartheid era.  During my interviews with Debbie Quinn and Fred Coppett I opened up to a certain extent, but I also still withheld certain names and incidents.  The one-for-all and all-for-one code reigning in the old police force, and that you don't reveal the inner secrets of the police force, was still in sway in my life, and now it might appear as if I am going to betray my people, the police.  Yesterday it felt as if I was betraying myself, but after I realised that I simply have to tell the truth I simply had to do it.  I have long since made my peace with God about all the atrocities which I committed in my position of power, and now it's time to make peace with the people of Natal, and it is now also time that I make peace with myself.  After my sentence I buried away the deeds of my past, buried it deep down, because I wanted to forget, but I can't.  Through the years in prison you, the audience, the people here, haunted me.  Maybe some of you here today are people assaulted by myself and my ex-colleagues.  Perhaps some of you here are people whom, after such an assault, I just dropped next to the side of the road without looking back to see whether you would rise up again.  I hope you are here today so that I can say to you I am sorry.  Now I would like to start by saying that when I started working in the Riot Unit at the age of 18 I started on the A shift.

            "  The section head of the shift was Deputy Warrant-Officer O'Connell, or Warrant-Officer O'Connell, and with me on the shift were, inter alia, Bruce Parow, Len Hawkin, Delport - his nickname was Dikdalies(?) - Ray Gosling, Andre Waring, and I can't remember the other names - except for one, Tobie Alberts.  He was a well known tracker.  I hadn't been in the unit for a week when I was sent out with these aforementioned members to Hammarsdale area.  I was with Richard O'Connell as part of the crew of the vehicle, as part of his crew.  If I remember correctly we arrived at the army base in Hammarsdale at about 10 o'clock that night.  There were Defence Force personnel present during Richard's situation analysis.  It was made clear what was expected of everybody.  If I recall correctly - I am sorry, it's eight and a half years ago - there were two Defence Force bakkies accompanying us to the homes.  After Richard's lecture I fell asleep.  We were meant to depart in the early hours of the morning, I think round about 3 o'clock.  When I was woken up for us to leave Richard told me that I should just stick close to him, that I should just stay behind him and walk behind him, and that I should not shoot before he starts shooting.  I was afraid.  I will not deny that.  I was fresh out of Police College and now I was confronted with the possibility of having to shoot somebody.  Richard told me that we were entering a big UDF/ANC area, and he pointed out the place where Dikdalies had been fired at by the ANC a week before, and had nearly sustained an injury from a shrapnel from a grenade.  We were in fact on our way to the attacker's home.  My first impressions of the unit and its members were that the ANC/UDF wanted us dead, they wanted to kill us.  I was now part of this unit and I would have shot if it was necessary.  If I didn't fire and we were killed what would have happened then?  We then stopped at some spot in the road.  Richard told some of the special constables that they were vehicle guards.  He told them this at the lecture at the defence base, and we therefore just got out and walked down into the valley.  I suspect that the people whom we were looking for also had guards placed in strategic positions, because I can recall that I heard whistling after a while.  The whistling started from about 200 metres away from us and then echoed up into the valley.  Richard O'Connell shouted that we knew they were there, and we then started running.  It was strange for  me to be running like that, because I had to clutch my 9mm by my side at the same time to prevent it from falling out.  I had to hold onto my rifle, my shotgun belt around my waist, as well as the shotgun in my left hand.  On top of all this I had to prevent my ... (Interpreter:  The interpreter could not hear that word)  I to some degree succeeded, but what was difficult was to follow in Richard's footsteps.  Suddenly we heard automatic gunfire coming from in front of us.  Richard shouted that we should open fire, and we did.  We then continued running and then shot again.  One of the members then shouted that he had caught somebody.  Our unit didn't carry cuffs, handcuffs.  It was not part of our equipment.  Richard had a shoelace which he used to handcuff the person.  He tied his hands behind his back, grabbed hold of his hands behind his back and tied his two thumbs together.  It was the first time that I had seen somebody being tubed with the inner tube of a car, the square piece of inner tube.  The late Tobie Alberts then tubed this man in order to extract information from him.  We wanted him to tell us where the others had run to and where they were obtaining their firearms from.  After about 20 minutes of tubing and an exchange of words in Zulu they told him to get up.  We then moved in a certain direction, and after about half an hour of walking we arrived at a rondavel.  After searching we found the rondavel empty.  Richard said that we should return to the vehicles.  We had arrived with about four vehicles and 15 men.  We then started walking back.  After a while we saw a group of about 20 people ahead of us, 20 heads in the darkness ahead of us.  It was starting to get light, but it was still quite dark.  The group of black men ahead of us were just a couple of metres away from us.  We saw that they were on their knees, they were in a kneeling position.  The late Tobie Alberts told us to also go down on our knees.  After we knelt down Tobie started making certain noises with his tongue.  If I may demonstrate it sounded like this.  (Interpreter:  The speaker is making a clicking sound with his tongue.)  And then he would keep quiet and then repeat those clicking noises or sounds.  The same kind of sound came from the group of people in front of us.  Tobie then got up and once again made these tongue-clicking sounds.  One man in this group got up, made tongue-clicking noises, and the rest of the group also got up.  Tobie motioned with his hand that we should also get up.  He once again made these clicking sounds and indicated that we should move forwards.  The other group also approached.  We were probably five metres away from then when somebody from their group shouted,\"Oh, amaphoyisa,\" and then they started running in all directions.  Richard shouted, \"Shoot them, shoot them.\"  Somebody fired a flare and shouted that I should also fire my two flares, which I did.  I then picked up my shotgun and, as the others were doing, fired at the people running away.  It was as if I was seeing a movie unfolding before my eyes.  A couple of light flares which were still hanging suspended in the air whilst we were shooting.  That is the scene imprinted in my memory.  I saw some of the people falling, and they were dragged along by their comrades, or picked up by the others.  We followed them, we ran after them, but Richard called us back and said that the flares were becoming extinguished and it would be dangerous to continue moving in all directions.  When somebody inquired about the one ANC man in detention it was noticed that he had just disappeared.  I think it was some or other special constable who had been guarding him.  I can't remember his name or his face.  I mentioned that there were about between 12 and 15 of us.  I can't remember exactly who were there except for myself, Tobie Alberts and Richard O'Connell.  There were special constables with us, as well as Dikdalies.  The two Defence Force bakkies had instructions to circle a certain area of Hammarsdale.  I don't know how many people there were in these bakkies or who they were.  In any event at some stage we met them and they helped us to search for this group who had shot at us.  We couldn't find anybody, and as soon as day broke we went back to the army base.  Richard departed to Pietermaritzburg before the rest of us.  He spoke to the Defence Force people to one side.  I don't know what they spoke about, and I didn't think anything of it.  I wasn't particularly interested or concerned.  I also didn't inquire what it was about.  The things which had happened in these approximately two hours were still in my mind, and that is perhaps why I can still remember these things, because this was my first operation with members of the unit.",

After a while he fortunately surfaced again and made haste to try and get away.  We left him there.  I took part in my first assaults in the unit.  After a couple of months I went to C shift under command of Warrant-Officer O'Connell.  Sergeant Potgieter, Gary Karbens, Gerhard Kotze, Dave Higgins, P W Smith, Stuart Jones, Sebron van Dyk and a group of special constables whose names I can't remember, they were all on this shift.  I can, however, remember Nxumalo's name, one of the special constables.  Jajozi and Nene I can remember as well.  Their initials are unknown to me.  I simply can't remember any more.  At this stage I was about 19-20 years of age.  Lieutentant Tokkie van der Heever was directly in command of the special constables, Major Deon Terblanche was head of the unit, and Lieutenant Danie Meyer was second in command.  On this shift I worked with Stuart Jones and Gerhard Kotze and their crew and took part in assaults.  Jones and my crew were together when we performed raids on ANC homes, looking for firearms ... (incomplete - end of Side A, Tape 1) ... not - I don't want to incriminate O'Connell or anybody else, or any other officer, but I was never reprimanded and told that what I was doing was wrong.  My officers had to know exactly what I was doing because on two occasions I was called in, firstly by Major Deon.  He told me that if I ever need him I should go directly to him first.  I not only got the impression that he would help me, but I knew that he would help me.  He was like a father to me, and always inquired about my wellbeing.  At a later stage I was called in by Lieutenant Meyer, and he made a statement to me that I thought I was a little god, and to be quite honest I did think that.  I did exactly as I pleased.  I then asked to work in the office for a while, and I then worked in the office with Constable Haywood for a while.  We performed duties relating to the duties of the special constables, as well as the payments made to them.  I noticed that their applications to work as special constables had been signed by an Inkatha chief and another Inkatha person.  Chief Ntombela's name or signature featured prominently.  At the beginning of 1991 I was transferred to B shift.  Lieutenant Meyer was overall in charge here.  Members of my shift were, inter alia, Franz Erasmus, Mark Barnard, Jimmy Smith, Viljoen, the two van Rooyen brothers and a Potgieter, whose nickname Dompotie.  There were about between 20 and 50 special constables, amongst others Madlala, the accomplice in the murder case, my murder case, Keshwa Mlambo, Dlamini, Bhengu and Zuma, and others whose names I can't recall now.  On this shift I took part in various assaults with Erasmus, Barnard and Smith on various occasions.  With Erasmus and Barnard we searched for arms, separately and together.  I would like to emphasise that Erasmus is serving imprisonment along with me, and he was a co-accused in my murder case.  He was also approached by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's investigating officers, but it was decided that he would not testify before the Commission since he was not on duty during the Seven Day War.  I would also like to place it on record that he took fundamental - played a fundamental role in draafting this statement.  At some stage I, along with Jimmy Smith and Vigilus Constantinopoulos, with the nickname of Billy, along with Lieutenant Enoch and warrant-officer - we worked in Mpophomeni in civilian clothes.  I can't remember exactly the reason why we were deployed there.  We slept in a tent in Midmar.  We were searching for some suspects.  I can't remember the case name or the case numbers.  What I can recall is that our group took part in a couple of assaults in the Mpophomeni area.  I also know that we tubed a couple of men there.  We also drank quite a lot.  That could also be the reason why I can't recall the events so clearly.  If Superintendent Meyer and O'Connell, if they cast their minds back they will confirm that I was drinking heavily.  Danie Meyer at one stage reprimanded me about my drinking habits, and Herman O'Connell will recall that I went to him regarding this problem, and that I was asking for a transfer away from the unit.  I realised that I had a drinking problem and I experienced the stress of the job very severely.   All the assaults and human rights violations were starting to catch up with me and having an effect on me.  The unit had to help me after I had been booked off by my doctor on the grounds of stress.  That could have prevented me committing murder, and that is the worst form of human rights violation.  Mark Barnard and myself were also involved with some special constables in assaults and searching for firearms.  Nhlanhla Madlala yesterday testified about his involvement as regards firearm sales.  I would like to add that Mark Barnard and myself were involved in nine assault cases on which we were found not guilty, and I also would not like to elaborate on this matter because it is contained in my submission to the Amnesty Committee.  This happened in February 1991 and does not relate to the Seven Day War.  Early on in my days in the unit I was told by senior members that I should at all times carry a home-made firearm in my vehicle to use if I accidentally shot somebody dead.  I would then have to plant this home-made firearm on this person so that it would look like it was a case of self-defence.  After the reports - after you've listened to the reports on the Seven Day War I now realise what part I played, and to all the people who lost family members, mothers, brothers, sisters, I can only say I am very, very sorry.  I missed my own mother's funeral because I was in prison.  That really hurt.  Just before the Seven Day War I was in Table Mountain, but we were only deployed there after the attack on Chief Maphumulo's house.  During such a patrol an Inkatha group of between 10 and 15 men stood chatting to us.  They asked whether we wanted to have a braai and have a couple of drinks.  We agreed and they brought meat and drinks.  My vehicle was parked against the hillside separating areas of the different chiefs, and at that stage houses had already been burnt down and there had been plundering by Chief Maphumulo's people.  Some of these people left the area to seek shelter in Chief Maphumulo's other house.  Some of them also went to other areas or to town.  We were there to prevent Chief Maphumulo's people launching an attack on the other area.  Whilst we were having our braai and drinking beer an Inkatha group came around the hillside unseen and launched a new attack on the ANC area.  We were assured by the group that were providing the meat and the beer that they were Inkatha people and we had nothing to fear regarding the attack.  According to them it also wouldn't last for very long.  After the valley had been burnt we then fired 1 000 feet flares for two reasons, namely, firstly, to see whether any groups were moving in the direction of the koppie to attack people in the Inkatha area, and, secondly, to prove to the ANC people that we were present in the area.  Constable Liebenberg and about six constables were in my vehicle.  Our radio couldn't contact our base, and the Inkatha group of between 10 and 15 people fell back across the koppie during the period that we shot up the light flares, and after a while, when we thought it was safe to do so, we changed our position to try and get a message through Zulu control that shots had been heard in the area, as well as the fact that there were houses and shops burning.  We also wanted to relay the message that we would remain in the area, and that the area was not quiet.  It was extremely dangerous to drive around in the ANC area because earlier shots had been fired at my vehicle, so to perform normal foot patrol, the normal patrols, was simply out of the question.  Neither myself nor my crew wanted to die during the early hours of the morning.  When day broke we returned to Pietermaritzburg.  We received a message that we had to accompany a female journalist to Chief Maphumulo's home, which we did.  There were about 400 refugees present.  Chief Maphumulo only arrived at the scene a short while afterwards, and I then withdrew my vehicle from the area.  After a while Chief Maphumulo left the area and his people and sought shelter somewhere.  This information I received from my specials.  The area was basically unhabited and there were many empty houses.  Many refugees had moved into the city.  I can't remember whether this was before or after the disappearance of Chief Maphumulo, but his vehicle had been fired at, but his guards were inside the car and he was unharmed.  But before this incident I knew that an attack would be launched on him.  This I also learnt through the specials and the Inkatha impis.  They believed that if Chief Maphumulo was killed they would then gain full control over the Table Mountain area.  Later all the areas around Pietermaritzburg erupted in violence.  The ANC's banning orders were lifted, Mr Mandela was freed.  The fighting between the ANC and the IFP became more severe.  I was sent from one area to the next to try and stop the fighting.  We worked 24-hour shifts.  That entailed 24 hours on duty, 24 hours off duty.  The worst hit areas were Imbali, Edendale, Thambuza, Table Mountain, Dinadi, KwaShange and Xaluza and Simero.  Later it spread to Dlamalala and Taylor's Halt.  At the age of 20 I had to make my own choices, and I was working with special constables who were just as young as I was, and they were policemen.  Their homes and families were attacked, and this was wrong in my view.  The specials were all Inkatha members and supporters, and the ANC and UDF were shooting at us.  They hated us and the specials hated them, and I hated them because I nearly died on several occasions as a result of their actions.  For that reason I saw myself as on the side of Inkatha.  I was taught by the National Party and the chiefs in the Riot Unit that the ANC/UDF alliance was our enemy, that they were terrorists, and as a policeman it was my duty to combat terrorism.  The war between us and the ANC was very severe, was intense.  To combat terrorism I allied myself with Inkatha.  When the ANC was unbanned I never went to a lecture or anything like that which would explain to me that they were no longer regarded as terrorists.  I continued my war, because the ANC war against myself and us showed no signes of abating.  For that reason I did not stop taking Inkatha members in small groups to areas at night, and for that reason I assured the safety of the Inkatha members and supporters by accompanying them to certain areas, and for that reason also I allowed the special constables to fire shots at ANC people from my vehicle whilst we were busy performing patrols, and for that reason I wanted to chase away the ANC when the ANC people and Inkatha wanted to attack each other.  We used stun grenades, tear gas, and even rifle fire.  An incident took place in the Henley Dam area.  Myself and about four vehicles were surrounded by a group of several thousand people.  They wanted to attack each other, the two groups, using pangas and even guns - and assegais.  The fighting then spread to the city itself.  Groups of people started gathering near the bus depots and started running through the streets.  We attended complaints where people had been assaulted and stabbed to death.  We saw Inkatha supporters walking around with pangas and kerries, knobkerries, and we were told traditional weapons were legal, it was legal for people to carry these, and that we were not allowed to confiscate these from Inkatha people.  Throughout there were groups in the Imbali/Edendale area, Dambuza, Ashdown and Simero.  These groups attacked people and vehicles, committed arson, and killed people.  We could only try and keep these groups apart.  At certain times we had to go through to Mpophomeni to bring the fighting there under control.  If there was no policeman well disposed towards the Inkatha they did it after Major Deon's death, 10 days before the start of the Seven Day War, because Roy Ngcobo was an acknowledged UDF supporter.  Major Deon was a good man.  He was a father figure to us at the unit.  Regarding the Seven Day War I can't recall very much, but I have certain flashes of memory.  Just before the commencement of the Seven Day War we buried Major Deon.  It was a very emotional period in my life.  I can remember that I cried a lot, and I also was drinking very heavily at that stage.  That was the only way which I knew to try and help me to forget.  What I do remember about the Seven Day War is that I started working on a certain day and 36 hours later I went off duty.  I remember that many houses and shops were burnt down.  There were many refugees.  Many of the special constables didn't even report for duty at the unit.  I noticed some of them in the areas in which I worked.  They would have gone to acknowledged Inkatha chiefs' homes, or larger Inkatha groups, and it was these groups of between 50 and 100, sometimes larger, who were responsible for burning down homes.  Who the actual role players were during this period is very hard to say, but the impression I got was that these were organised attacks from the side of the two Inkatha chiefs.  Lieutenant Meyer at the time, and Captain McEverly, were also present in these areas to gain first-hand impressions of what was going on.  I was busy with my own war against the ANC.  Apart from saying that these two officers were in the area it would be impossible for me to say exactly what they did.  At this stage my vehicle crew started firing at groups of ANC people without reason.  I authorised it because I was told or commanded that we should do that.  It was a radio message which I received.  Firing would of course not be permitted against the Inkatha groups because there were special constables in these groups.  I myself gave one or two belts to the special constables who were part of these groups running around.  I repeat, I gave one or two belts to the special constables who were in groups running around.  I can't remember what other shifts I worked, who worked with me, or who the special constables were that I could recognise amongst the Inkatha groups.  Everything was such a jumble.  It was chaotic.  We were told at some stage by the officers that we should not enter certain areas since certain the people in certain ANC areas didn't want us there.  32 Batallion of the Defence Force, who worked with us, they were the chosen force to be present in these areas.  Our officers told us that we could not comply with their demands and that we should simply adopt a lower profile in such areas.  That suited us because then we were guarding the Inkathas.  Later the same areas requested us to patrol their areas.  They then wanted the Defence Force people out of their areas.  That was after the 32 Batallion members apparently raped women and committed theft in the area.  The war which I was waging continued until my arrest.  In my view I can't see that the term Seven Day War could be connected with all the events in and around Pietermaritzburg at the time.  Between 1988 and 1991 I was working for this unit.  How many people died during this period alone, not to mention the period before 1988?  Even after 1991 until 1996 many more people died in these areas.  It was only when the Truth Commission started hearing evidence about the Seven Day War it could be seen that Natal has been embroiled in a situation of war for many, many years, and the boil will have to be lanced, and that will cleanse the wound.  Hopefully Natal will be healed by the evidence to be submitted.  I will never in my life forget what I experienced in my police career.  My part in the events and my war against the ANC, for this I apologise.  I apologise before all the people of South Africa.  I am sincerely sorry for what the National Party made me do.  On the other hand I forgive the ANC for their part in all the attempts on my life, as well as for murders and attacks on my colleagues and Inkatha people.  I greet the new, reformed South Africa with new hope for each and every South African.  My fear belongs to the past, but now, because I have made a confession today here, I leave today as a marked man.  For the rest of my life I'll be stigmatised, which will declare to the world that I am a traitor, but myself, Erasmus, Madlala, did we ever think that we would walk out of herescott-free?  We can't dispute it.  As from today we live in total fear, inside and outside of prison.  Many will say that I deserve all this, and that now I will really know how the people in the black areas must have felt, but there's a difference.  You can change to a different area and make a fresh start.  I have to go back to where I came from.  I have no choice.  I've been branded as a traitor, a traitor to my own people.  But there will be people who understand, they understand that the truth must triumph in the end, and hopefully the truth will set me free one day.  I would like to conclude by saying - the question which the Commission puts to people, what can the Commission do to help the suffering of the victims?  As far as that's concerned, firstly I think all the people who are still without homes and a livelihood after all these years, I think they must be taken care of ... (incomplete - end of Side B, Tape 1) ... in their housing programmes.  Although the former Government must take the blame for that the current Government must ensure that these things are addressed.  The former Government can make a better contribution, because it still exists as a political party in our country.  Not only must the National Party become more involved, the other parties, all the other political parties and organisations should also become more involved.  Everybody should make some gesture to prove that all parties and groupings are standing together as one to try and build up this country of ours.  The times when political parties and organisations were just seen as paying lip service to certain ideas amongst members of the public are past.  They must now make some effective contribution and co-operate.  Various denominations and church groups have led the way in this regard, and they've proved that these attempts can succeed.  Each party or political organisation is connected to some church or religious nomination, and that can serve as a base to bring together people from all walks of life and spheres of life to become actively involved.  Secondly, people who were damaged in some way, or who suffered damage in some way, this problem must be addressed as well.  People whose human rights were violated, they must be looked at.  They must be brought face to face with the people who actually violated their human rights, such as, for instance, myself.  I still have to be given the opportunity to appear before the Amnesty Committee to reveal my full participation in events, as well as to beg forgiveness from the people, the people whom I caused suffering to.  But for me that is not sufficient.  I would like to see that more is done to promote reconciliation.  For instance, a non-official gathering place could be created so that the perpetrator can meet the person whose human rights he violated, and to talk about the reasons for all the various attacks which led to human rights violations.  If after the amnesty hearing I am acquitted I would very much like to be part of such a movement, or even to start up such a clinic.  My final and third point is the following.  I suggest that more effort - more attempts are made to involve former policemen in hearings before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to make full disclosure about all their acts relating to the apartheid era, that which they did under the banner of the National Party.  Thank you.",

            "  Mr Chairman and all the Members of the Commission, and the audience at large, I do want to say this first of all, to highlight a few things that I may forget.  This word refugees we did try our best to remove it from people's mind, and instil displacees.  That we did because this word refugee could make people afraid and scared ever of going back to their places - original.  For the fact that they have been moved for a while we thought they will be always longing to go back to their places, original places, because it was clear to us that the way they've been removed from their original places was not an acceptable way in any way.  I do want to say this.  First of all I will begin here, that even you have asked me to say something about the people who fled from their places there are many things that make one feel that talking about them some things are implicated right there.  As I was a pastor at Georgetown, not too far away from the main road which runs from Pietermaritzburg to Vulindlela, there was no any other way that we could avoid - to avoid being spectators and folding our arms.  And also we thus believed that the church stands to help those who are going through atrocities, and it is also my belief as a person that my duty calls for me to enlist help to people that need help.  It has been evident the story about the children of Israel leaving Egypt to the Canaan land, I'll read about in the Bible and other books.  I've never seen it, or witnessed such thing.  But on the 28th of March in the morning of that day the picture that always read about from the books came back, and it was so clear and visible in my mind.  From around nine in the morning I saw people coming from the hill top with possessions and some boxes, and some with their babies in the back, women.  Some trying to help those who were not feeling well, sick, and others because they were old they could not walk properly and probably fast.  Some others trying to guide their children to make sure they are safe.  They were headed towards the valley.  After a while some of them arrived in Edendale, where I was stationed at the time.  I would like to say at this point in time, because of my duty I was not only working in Edendale, but I was -the circuit of pastors was all over in Vulindlela.  These people came, arrived, and after two hours they were already at Thuthuka Community Hall, had arrived there.  Right at that time the people who were there that day were approximately 5 000 or even more.  Most of those people were already accepted by the St Albert Mission of the Roman Catholics in the valley.  Some were taken into the school down the valley, higher primary school.  Those who had already arrived in Edendale it was imperative that within a twinkling of an eye we should provide them with accommodation.  We were not hesitant at all.  The community was actually conducive to contain about 1 000 people, but it was inevitable of us to even put more people to be accommodated in that place.  We asked YMCA of Edendale to accommodate others, and different churches in the area to accommodate those people.  I will also like at this point in time to make mention of this.  I do salute them, the pastors and the leaders of the churches who accommodated those people, except for the Seventh Day Adventist Church, because of the reason that their church was beautiful.  It also had a carpet, so those people could make it dirty.  During those days the youths of Edendale wanted to burn the church house.  I do thank God by giving us strength to prevent the youth from burning that church.  I don't want to dwell in that one.  Subsequently to that we tried to figure out as to who those people were, and also know how many they were.  The great need was that of food, water, blankets and clothes.  It was as clear to us that as pastors of the area - I had already touched other pastors from the valley - we had no way of meeting the great need.  I do want to thank the PACSA, Peter Kirchoff who was the leader, who came to us when we needed them most, so that there could also be communication not only of the people in the church, but also to start a committee which was subsequently named Pietermaritzburg Crisis Co-ordinating Committee, which was subdivided - people from the church, politicians and other community members, and ... (incomplete - end of Side A, Tape 2) ... we could not attend that meeting because there was still violence in the area.  But that meeting did help to meet the need of the things that I've already mentioned.  Some of the things that we needed were toilets, because people were many.  There was that fear that gathering of such a large number of people in such a small area could probably have caused diseases after that.  But one other thing was that the people who were coming it was not only the reason that they were - they were not only running away for their safety, but also they had left behind dead bodies.  Some were their mothers, some brothers, some sisters, and their children, that even when they were here their minds were still back crying and mourning that at least those of them that were already killed should be buried decently.  Their pain was so deep and excruciating, and it was not so easy that they should go back home because the way they had escaped, and the things they related to us that were happening there, and how those who were killed were killed, young and old, made them not to even wish to go back home any more.  It was such a difficulty, especially that at the time the police even - even when you report a matter to the police that could probably help them to go back home the police would not even take notice of that, or they will probably take their own time to attend to the matter reported.  I do also like to express that one great help emanated out of the organisation that we already formed, because this organisation monitored in the whole area as to what had happened, and did point out clear to the newspapers how great and how deep the damage was, so that those who had compassion could bring food and clothes.  Let me also state that when we had already received all those things the difficult part of it was to distribute these things to make sure that everyone is helped.  It is amazing that people in such conditions, those who were not affected at all, also wanted to come nearby so that they also could get some help.  Especially when you distributed food people who were not so much highly affected by this could come and even destruct the whole thing, so that at the end no one could get food or benefit from that, because they were not in need at all.  It is surprising that those who have things, possessions, is the one who is greedy more than the needy ones.  I do believe that the one who is in need knows for sure that - what it means, and the greedy ones always want to remain greedy ever.  This was one of the problems we encountered in trying that we meet the needs of the people.  We did not have such a problem in as far as blankets were concerned, but we did encounter a problem in as far as clothing was concerned.  Truly some of the people that we knew who were amongst those who were giving, distributing clothes to the people, had - we saw them now wearing new clothes suddenly.  It came out to us that as they were going to distribute these clothes to these people they did steal some clothes from the ones that we gave them.  Although I must say that I don't say this was such a disturbance to us.  I will also like to say that of the things I've already mentioned here one other challenge we had was in as far as preparing for the funerals.  We had to make arrangements that the corpses get to the mortuaries, or we had to take the people here that we were helping to the mortuaries so that they could identify their people from the mortuary.  One painful thing in that act I remember particularly.  I was with these particular people.  When we got there they discovered that the corpse was so brutally injured that they could not continue, they could not be at peace after seeing that.  One of those people, before we left back to the churches we had to take him to the doctor.  I must say that at this point in time the Edendale Hospital had no good reputation at all.  I think one of the reasons which led to that was that one day the ambulance of Edendale Hospital was discovered not undertaking its duties, instead colluding with the other organisation in destructing and destroying the UDF.  That led to the bad reputation of the Edendale Hospital.  The males who were injured even among the refugees would cry and say, \"Please, no,\" in case you want to take them to the Edendale Hospital.  I do want to thank the private practitioners who were prepared to enlist help to the people.  Some of those people we could not take them to the hospital or the surgeries in an ambulance, as I have already said, and our cars as pastors, and others who were working along with, became ambulances.  We rendered now ambulance services.  I don't want to dwell in that one, but I do want to say one other thing is that a woman before she could deliver it does not matter where she is.  Now, one day in my car, even before we got to the hospital, because those who were expectant agreed to be taken to the hospital.  Because I have a station wagon car I heard at the back the cry of a baby, of an infant, but I had to drive to the hospital.  I said to the parents of the baby I would like to give the baby a name, and I will say she is Nobubaleka, but they did not take that name, and I had never seen them after that.  I have since seen them that time.  Now, these are some of the things that we encountered.  One other thing that transpired, we know that to be afforded an opportunity and to be a family is that it is important to know that it's quite important to be a family.  Now, because they were in that condition in such a situation the family concept, the concept of being a family was completely lost.  The growing ups, especially the boys, did not accept to be accommodated in the churches and halls.  Instead of that they requested for a place at friends' places in the Edendale area.  We only had - we had males and females under one roof, not divided inside.  That created a situation of not having any privacy at all as families and so on.  This - as a result of this some encountered marital problems.  I think because of this reason, because of the way the situation was, no privacy at all, secondly they were intermingling with many other people under one roof, I am sad to say people - I won't mention people's names here, because they came to me as a pastor to confide in - it was called for that after that some should go through a divorce.  I know of two couples who encountered that problem.  I also know that there could be some others, but it was not so easy for them to approach me.  I think those two approached me because they respected the church.  That brought in my mind that it was so clear that being exposed in such a situation brought difficulties to families, and that led to the breaking of families.  I also want to highlight in as far as education is concerned.  Those refugees - I remember Mr Zondi was a teacher at Nzameni High School.  I believe he already came forward here to the Truth Commission.  I think even some others who were teachers as well were made not to carry on with the teaching profession, because in the schools in which they were teaching people of Vulisaka and Mnyandu had fled the area.  They still did continue and carry on, but the teachers could not go and teach though they wished they could because they had fled and escaped, and not wanting to go back to the area.  And also there was no one who was prepared to guarantee their safety.  And there are many other children who were forced to leave school.  Some were already in higher standards.  Their education was highly disturbed.  Even though what I am going to talk about now concerns me, but I would like to say that I had a boy who was doing matric at that time at a vocational school.  He was highly involved in the Seven Day War, that after the Seven Day War he decided to leave the country and escape.  Even after trying to encourage him, to tell him that all has passed now, let's look into the future, he refused completely.  He left, he went to Zimbabwe.  Even there he faced problems.  Right now he is trying to bring himself to a better standard of living.  I do want to highlight on something about the things that already have been mentioned before regarding the Seven Day War, that this gentleman here, Meyer, who was right here, I am surprised he repudiated everything about the fact that the police were also shooting, because in the Xaluza fight there's a person I know, by the name of Rudolf, who was shot at by the police in a helicopter.  He was shot and he was carried back home.  And one other thing that is puzzling me is that where he was shot the area was predominantly of the ones that were attacking, but he was shot in that very area.  Let me backtrack and go back tot he story of the refugees.  I say that Thuthuka Hall was used, and other  churches - especially the Thuthuka Hall.  After all this was over because it had accommodated refugees there were those who attacked it and burnt the hall.  Even today that hall is useless, cannot be used in any way.  The insurance of the hall had altercation and arguments to the effect of, \"You were in charge, not us,\" and so forth, because there are two insurances, there's state of emergency insurance and the usual normal insurance.  After leaving Edendale it was estimated that to refurbish the whole hall would cost R4 000,00.  I do want to request from the Commission that if there is any way - Mr Chairman and the Members of the Committee, is there anything that can be done regarding this hall, because it did not help one person but helped many people at the time of need?  As a result of this help that it rendered to the people it was destroyed completely.  Even if that was not the reason, but the way the arguments went on between the two different insurances led to us think that's the problem.  One other thing that was important was that our duties as pastors that we carried on on daily basis, we had to put them aside and have second-in-charge people, because we had telephones ringing continuously for 24 hours, people wanting to inquire about the state of the refugees.  One other thing was that we could not also conduct as daily duties as usual because the most important thing at the time was for us to help - enlist help to the refugees, especially attending meetings of the organisations that I've already explained about before, and going up and down about other things with regard to the situation.  Our level of performance and Christianity deteriorated, and we could not attend to some other things.  Also that created  some kind of enmity in the church between those who were",

            "suspecting that why did we accept and accommodate these people in the churches.  But by God's grace we don't know how it happened that the church was not divided into two, having one group saying, \"We will go to church, to our church, because we are Inkatha,\" and the other group saying, \"As UDF we will go to our own church.\"  I say this because in our church the church was predominantly Inkatha than UDF.  One other thing that people had in mind at the time was the Apostle Church was working hand in hand with UDF.  I don't even know what was wrong in that even if it was so.  Truly speaking I did encourage people to take one side instead of being neutral, because there are many people who died who did not even know what was happening, because those who died knowing what was happening at least they died satisfactory.  But it is pathetic to know that many people who died are people who died not knowing whether they were going or coming, no direction at all.  I do like in closing to highlight on this, that after the refugees in the attacks that took place on Tuesday there are people who were killed in KwaMnyandu on Thursday.  One was shot and died just towards our church building.  That boy did lie there since Thursday up to Sunday morning.  One of you Commissioners up front there went with him, were trying to locate the corpse, dead bodies of the people around the area.  We found out that Sunday morning there were bodies that were already beginning to spoil and getting rotten lying there.  We tried to ask the police to come fetch all the corpses and dead bodies lying around the neighbourhood.  I do believe that people who were resident in the places they had left now, and those who  witnessed how people were killed brutally, that I believe",

            "that even today they don't wish to go back to their places.  One other thing that adds to this.  One of the chiefs who's now late, who said he will plough in KwaMnyandu sugar cane.  Even today when you pass by that place you see trees more than houses, because people were so scared, they were traumatised about that, that they don't wish to go back to those places.  I do believe that even when this is all said and done now, and in the past, it will take a long time for sure that those people's minds and their souls get back to a normal state of a normal person.  There are people who will say - who were hiding in those churches, when you say to them, \"Hey, there is Ntombela,\" they will run and almost want to get out through windows.  When you say, \"There is Nsikiza,\" they will look for a door so they can run away as fast as their feet can carry them.  Some others I do believe that even at night they do have those dreams, scary dreams, nightmares that make them shout at night, and cry.  I think the healing of those people who were exposed to that will take time.  Now we are happy that you in front here are putting so much effort that all the things which took place should come out into open, that the healing should start and proceed.  I am one of those who will take time to be fine, and this is why I said, \"Please clean the chair before I sit,\" and do forgive me for that.  It is because of the things I had seen, and also my upbringing has a lot to do with this.  I think it will be my grandchildren who will see the Canaan land.

            "BACKGROUND",
            ".  Edendale township is bordered by rural areas occupied by several tribes, who resorted under traditional authority with chiefs and headmen.  These tribes are Mpumuza, Inadi, Mafunze and Nxamalala.  The bulk of these tribes are comprised of members of the IFP.  Edendale on the other hand did not resort under the tribal authorities, and the bulk of the township's inhabitants were UDF/ANC aligned.  Since 1987 unrest began to break out in several of the outlying areas such as Taylor's Halt, Gezabuso, KwaShange, Mpumuza, Xaluza, Sweetwaters, Nxamalala and Elandskop.   As UDF/ANC stepped up recruiting campaigns in these rural areas IFP members in Edendale were driven out of the area, and clashed between rival groups frequently took place.  Inhabitants of areas had to state their alliance either to the one or to the other of the opposing political parties, and large scale intimidation took place.  No go areas for members of opposing political parties became established, and incidents of violence only persisted in those areas where no clear domination by a particular grouping had been established.  Because the main route\n /\"to\n\"to Pietermaritzburg goes through Edendale rural IFP supporters who worked in town were compelled to make use of the routes, and frequent attacks began to take place on commuters in buses and taxis.  Between 1987 and 1990 the conflict escalated and the UDF/ANC gained support and control in certain of the rural areas.  During the period industrial labour actions and strikes were intensified.  These were mainly spearheaded by UDF/COSATU alliance.  IFP supporters who did not want to participate and wished to continue working were prevented from going to work as they would be attacked en route.  Bus drivers were also influenced to participate in the strike action and stay-aways were initiated, resulting in no transport being available.  This again resulted in counter actions or boycotts of the bus transport by IFP members.  It also resulted in heightening of the tensions.  Bus drivers who ignored the call and drove through Edendale were attacked, and several buses were damaged by stones and petrol bombs, and they were shot at.  Commuters were also injured and killed.  As a result of these attacks there were large scale mobilisations of IFP members bent on launching attacks on the inhabitants of Edendale.  It was only through the proactive intervention of members of Unit Eight that these large scale attacks were averted on three occasions, when\n/\"IFP\n\"IFP members who had mobilised were persuaded not to carry on.  During certain of the periods when attacks were intensified members of Unit Eight and the SADF patrolled and lined the route through Edendale to prevent attacks on buses and taxis.\n      \"The Seven Day War.  On Sunday the 25th of March 1990 there was a big IFP rally in Durban, where Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi was to address IFP supporters.  On the way to the rally the buses which travelled through Edendale were attacked.  The police had anticipated that there would be such an attack because these attacks on buses occurred regularly.  Director Meyer spoke to Mr David Ntombela and requested that the buses use another route.  Mr Ntombela, however, insisted that they would use the route through Edendale in the morning because it would be early in the morning and therefore there shouldn't be any trouble.  They would then use the Howick route when they come back in the afternoon.  This was a detour of about 20 kilometres.  According to Director Meyer Mr Ntombela was quite adamant about using Edendale road in the morning.  There were approximately 100 buses in the convoy.  The police did escort the buses, but because there were so many buses the policemen were widely dispersed among them.  SADF members were also deployed along the route together with SAP members.  Despite\n /\"these\n\"these measures numerous attacks took place along the route.  There were instances where buses stopped, passengers disembarked, and chased the attackers.  There were accusations by both sides, passengers and bystanders, that the opposite side had initiated the attacks.  The police did everything in their power to keep the buses moving, and were specifically instructed to do this.  During the course of the day several illegal blockades were erected on the roads in the Edendale area, consisting of burning tyres, old car wrecks, etcetera, which the police had to clear away.  Whilst trying to clear the debris and attend to an accident which had occurred as a result of the roadblocks they came under attack from Edendale township dwellers.  They had to use tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds that attacked them.  Contrary to Mr Ntombela's undertaking that the buses would not return via Edendale road Director Meyer observed a bus taking that route.  Members of his unit then reported that they had tried to direct buses, but several refused to stop and continued.  He then took members to Imbali robots to try and stop buses, and went into Edendale itself to assess the situation.  The members contacted him by radio and said that the buses didn't want to stop.  About 12 to 14 buses stopped opposite Edendale Hospital.  All the passengers disembarked and wanted to march\n /\"through\n\"through Edendale.  He and about six to seven members tried to stop them and turn them back.  While the SAP were trying to turn them back shots were being fired at them and the passengers from houses in the township.  At the same time people at a nearby shop were also firing shots.  Two members approached the shop to apprehend the shottists.  One was arrested with an unlicensed firearm.  The groups of passengers insisted that they wanted to walk through Edendale.  Presumably they wanted to demonstrate a show of strength.  The police refused to let them through.  Director Meyer was compelled to hold their firearms at the ready, and this persuaded the passengers to re-embark.  The police blockaded the road and told the bus drivers that they could not go through Edendale, they had to turn around.  None of the buses from the rally therefore went through Edendale.  However, other buses which came through Edendale not connected to the rally, especially empty buses with just the driver, were attacked.  These buses were badly damaged.  At this stage the police came under heavy attack.  Every vehicle through Edendale was a target.  Policemen were put at Imbali robots and at Gezabuso on the Edendale road to stop all vehicles from going into Edendale.  Police vehicles were continuously attacked.  Police worked until midnight and then withdrew so fresh people could be\n /\"deployed\n\"deployed the next day, because virtually all their resources had been utilised during the afternoon and evening.  During the planning it was planned that the SADF would be placed at various strategic points on the main road.  They generally performed patrol duties on the main road.  Their manpower was also somewhat limited as the assistance which they could offer was limited.  On this particular day Director Meyer cannot remember if the SADF were at their positions where it had been planned that they would be.  On the same day at Marawa House, the KwaZulu Government offices and IFP offices in Edendale, was attacked and building damaged.\n On Monday 26th of March no buses were running, so no IFP people could go to work.  Blockades were still erected on the roads.  A few taxis tried to go into town.  A petrol bomb was thrown at a taxi near Georgetown, forcing it into the gutter and resulting in one passenger being badly burnt.  On Monday morning Nsikayezwa Zondi's vehicle was attacked at Thulani's Garage in the Moscow area.  He was chief of the Inadi tribe.\"\nMr Chairman, correction.  It's not Inadi tribe, it's in fact Mpumuza tribe.\n\"The IFP supporters who were unable to go to work were already mobilising at Elandskop as news of the attack on the chief's vehicle was received, which incenses them even more.  At\n /\"this\n\"this stage Mr Ntombela was not in the area.  He went directly from the rally to Ulundi, since he was a member of KwaZulu Parliament.  He only returned on the Monday evening after he had heard about the trouble.\n On Tuesday 27th March IFP supporters from Sweetwaters mobilised and marched towards Edendale.  Police stopped them on the border of Xaluza and Mpumuza boundary.  Director Meyer spoke to Philip Zondi, IFP leader for Sweetwaters, and the brother of Chief Zondi.  He undertook to take his people back.  The IFP supporters had traditional weapons with them.  No firearms were observed.  Whilst these discussions were taking place a group broke away from the main group and went into Xaluza, where Detective Sergeant Nene's house was attacked, and he was injured and later died of his injuries.  Stun grenades were used by the police to prevent the break-away group from going further into Xaluza.  Another group also broke away and went into Xaluza over the hill.  They were cut off my police and SADF and forced to retreat to Mpumuza area.  On the other side of the hill, on the Mpumuza side, an attack was also launched on Ashdown residents.  During the attack several houses were burnt down.  During the day the police had their hands full trying to prevent IFP groups from several areas forming and marching to Edendale.  On Tuesday night an IFP leader,\n /\"Poswa,\n\"Poswa, was shot dead and burnt in his car at KwaShange turn-off.  The hostility from the people in the area as UDF supporters was such that the police could not go in and remove the body immediately.  The following day the Riot Investigation Unit, under Senior Superintendent Upton, went and retrieved the body.\n On Wednesday 28 March attacks started early in the morning while it was still dark.  News was received of several attacks at:  Botswana, IFP area, houses burnt;  Ashdown, UDF area, houses burnt;  Mpumuza, IFP area;  Xaluza, UDF area;  Sweetwaters, IFP area;  Simero, UDF area.  All available manpower was mobilised in these areas.  Elandskop people mobilised because of information received concerning Poswa's death.  They then launched the attack on KwaShange, Gezabuso, and the bottom section of Vulisaka.  Police had to try and deal with all these attacks.  There was simply not enough manpower to cope with the magnitude, and consequently reinforcements were requested from Durban Riot Unit.  The attacks on the two prominent IFP leaders was an aggravating factor that exacerbated an already tense situation, and which appeared to have sparked off the intensity of the confrontation.  Attacks on KwaMnyandu, a UDF stronghold, also took place on Wednesday and several people were killed.  The terrain in several of these areas was such\n /\"that no\n\"that no vehicles could traverse, and it could only be reached on foot or by helicopter.  The helicopter was deployed on more than one occasion to disperse groups of attackers, and also to assist members under siege under the command of Superintendent O'Connell.  In the Ziboveni/KwaShange area a group of looters were cornered with the help of the helicopter and Riot Investigation Unit members.  They were caught into a tent.  Several people were arrested and charged for possession of suspected stolen property because complainants could not be identified.  IFP groups also mobilised at Sweetwaters, Ezimbomvini and Umvundleweni.  On nightfall attacks had subsided and reinforcements had arrived.\n On Thursday 29 March and Friday 30 March sporadic incidents still occurred in several areas, resulting in some deaths and damage to property, but the intensity of the attacks had subsided.  The violence also spilled over to the Imbali and Mpophomeni areas on these days.  In one incident in Simero area Superintendent van den Heever and three other members responded to a request for assistance from a member of the Riot Investigation Unit who was trapped in the area.  They were ambushed and involved in a shoot-out with heavily armed men before they could extricate themselves.  A foreign reporter and Natal Witness reporter also got caught in the same situation and also\n /\"managed\n\"managed to escape unharmed.\n On Saturday 31st March the violence had abated substantially.",

You heard Constable Harrington say that it was commonplace before, during and after the Seven Day War, for Riot Unit vehicles to be used to transport Inkatha people into UDF areas to launch attacks; it was common for the Riot unit and the special constables to confiscate weapons from UDF areas and to give them or to sell them to IFP people;  that it was common for shots to be fired at passers-by in UDF areas by the special constables, not knowing whether those people were left alive or dead, and so on.

If I tell you that the first 300 special constables which we got, their conditions of service stated that they were entitled to take their firearms home.  On the first day we discharged 16 when they returned, and we then drove around trying to collect their firearms as a result of problems which they caused.  So we threw out - tried to use other methods to control these people.  The main reason why they came to us was to take over guard duties, to guard IFP leaders' homes, and also to man strongpoints.  When they started working with members on shifts, and forming part of the vehicle crew, I can see how Harrington perhaps went astray.  You see, we placed young policemen in positions of power, and in which they exercised control over about, say, 10 special constables.

In your presentation you are almost discordant or inconsistent with the presentations that have been made by many other people yesterday, on Monday and Tuesday.  You are almost at odds with them.  I am beginning to wonder what is your conception of truth.  We are a Truth Commission here.  So the big question in your conception of truth.  Number two, with regard to the specials, you clearly and loudly say most of them were on their own missions.  I completely disagree with you.  The specials were recruited, were brainwashed, were trained to kill, by somebody.  Probably you know who that person was.  Who was behind that?  They were not trained to be guards, they were trained to kill.  Can we hear from you who was responsible for that training?  ",

I think that in any democratic system, where certain allegations are made against a person, a person must surely be in possession of the allegations to be able to prepare a defence or a submission.  So to say to me - comment on answers given by previous witnesses, it's not very easy at all.  As far as training and indoctrination is concerned, and everything surrounding the special constables, these issues were not my decisions, and I don't think that those decisions and training - those decisions weren't made on our level, and I think that those answers must be sought with the government of the day.

It's just a note, you may not respond to it, but I just want to say that I would argue against your claim that ... (incomplete - end of Side B, Tape 1) ... your submission makes it clear that the attackers were only local people.  People in the bus only disembarked to chase away the attackers.  At no stage are they referred to as aggressors, they were always defending themselves, and I am finding it difficult to believe that, because some witnesses have referred to instances where the buses would stop, and the passengers will do some unpleasant things like urinating at other people's fences, which to me is provocative.  That's observation number one in relation to impartiality.  And also you have admitted meetings between yourself and Mr Ntombela, which was good, but what I am trying to say here is that I am not hearing you telling us of similar meetings between yourself and with leaders of UDF or ANC to demonstrate impartiality.  And also the manner in which Mr Ntombela seems to have been handled by yourselves.  I am not going to go into details because Mr Lax has thrashed this point thoroughly with yourself, but the fact that he ignored your advice about the road, and he was not confronted, he was not reprimanded.  That reminds me of what some witnesses said about how Inkatha leadership was treated softly by police force.  And the question now.  Those were just notes.

As far as I'm concerned, and my own impartiality is concerned, as far as the peace at Nxamalala is concerned, I played a big role in that.  I don't want to go into detail, but there are people who will be able to vouch for me on that.  I'd like to go further and mention Imbali before the Seven Day War.  I had talks with UDF leaders.  I had the UDF leaders in the Unit Eight hall and we had talks with them.  We were trying to make peace, to stop the factions from fighting.  At that stage the specific leaders would have reported back to their communities on the Sunday.  On that Sunday our State President, Mr Mandela, was released and the meeting never took place.

If we, for instance, look at one particular witness, he said how the police had attacked the house with R4 guns.  Once again R4 guns were never used by the police.  R5s, the first instruction which started taking place in R5s only took place in 1991, and I have here a certificate which proves when the first instructor in R5s was trained.

Anyway, finally, yesterday I got an impression, wrongly perhaps, that in your presentation you were a bit defensive, and I was worried because part of the objective of the Truth Commission is to bring about reconciliation.  And one challenge that we have in South Africa is reconciliation between the police service as well as the community at large, especially the black sector of the community.

There could have been flaws, but I definitely sensed some sincerity, and I had hoped that with that kind of sincerity the gap between the police service and the community will be closed.

As far as arrests are concerned, I don't know anything about this specific arrest or arrests, but I think what must be mentioned is something which perhaps contributed to the community's opposition to us, and that is the emergency regulations in force at the time.  You know, the emergency regulations were there to suppress the communities, for the same reason as these arrests were performed.  If we got back to the records, if they are available, it was mostly UDF people detained under the emergency regulations.  I agree wholeheartedly.

And if UDF people were seen to be negotiating peacefully to bring about the end of political violence in an area it seemed that it was State policy to arrest them and place them in detention, because the Government could not be seen to allow UDF people to be involved in peace negotiations.

            "\"(Inaudible) ... Seven Day War has been given to the events that took place in Pietermaritzburg and surrounding areas from 25th of March to 31st of March 1990.  The events took the form of attacks on communities on a scale not previously experienced in this area, if not the province as a whole.  Whilst the Seven Day War was to some extent a repeat of previous attacks on communities, but on a larger scale this time, it is our submission here that it was to a greater extent a turning point in the conflict in the Pietermaritzburg area.  Why do we say this?  It seems to us that the strategy of detention of UDF and COSATU leaders, and small scale attacks on communities in Pietermaritzburg, had failed to stem the rising tide of the people's legitimate struggle against apartheid in Pietermaritzburg townships.\"",

            "  A large part of it is in English, but - I mean is in Zulu, except certain smaller sections.  Maybe then I'll try to interpret as I go along.  It might not be easy.  Let me just continue then in Zulu.  Why do we say the things we are saying now?  It looks to us as if the detention of the UDF and the leaders of the COSATU, and the way the attacks took place in the community, all this could not prevent the people of Pietermaritzburg to continue with the violence.  This Seven Day War to us started a new way of attacking the community in the manner in which they were attacking the community, and soon after that the tendency of killing of the leaders of ANC started in this area.  So the nature of Seven Day War, the way one will look at it, and the manner in which the attack was undertaken, it does show that those were ideas coming from the apartheid government.  At ANC we did believe that - we were made to believe that this Seven Day War has to do a lot with politics, but one could tell and it was clear and obvious that that was perpetrated by the government of apartheid, and it was intended to destroy ANC and UDF.  It had no part at all in getting this country independent.  ANC believe that we should look deep into the following things.  We believe that we don't understand the Seven Day War if we don't give the picture of the role that the people of Pietermaritzburg played, especially after 1976.  For us to understand even the way the violence outbroke in 1975 we will say that since the banning of ANC in 1960 towards 1980 there was no a political organisation that could not say it represents all the people of Pietermaritzburg.  And we believe that Inkatha wanted to destroy ANC completely in this area.  We do believe that this area, this war was deliberately making the Inkatha stronger and a strong hold than other organisations.  Places like Sobantu and Imbali were not so much affected in this.  Even the forming of UDF in 1983, many people were not affected at the time when the UDF was being formed, but afterwards that started.  We will first talk about the pensioning in Huletts Aluminium(?).  This boycott brought some light and shed light to the community of Pietermaritzburg regarding this company, which is one of the biggest in Pietermaritzburg, and had so many employees, and employees had nothing called specials then.  We will say that the boycott, the importance of that boycott was described as though the leaders, and those who were behind it, were ANC members and UDF, and were fired from the company as a result of this boycott and the belief.  That brought so much influence in the community, and this stay-away took place in 1985, which was called to sympathise with those who were expelled and fired from work.  This stay-away followed shortly after boycotting the stores and buying and shopping from the shops.  And what is important to us, and which led to the Seven Day War, is that even so the people in Pietermaritzburg were very supportive, and that showed that they wanted to be with the UDF, as well as COSATU.  But what I will stay started the whole fracas in 'Maritzburg, and it even led to an outbreak of violence were the deeds of the Inkatha to force people to join Inkatha.  These plans of Inkatha to force people in order to join Inkatha were people like Sikiza Zuma from Harewood, Joseph Mabaso, KwaPatha, Makaliza and Dambuza, as well as Jerome Mncwabe in Imbali, David Ntombela at Vulindlela, as well as another Mr Mncwabe from Sinathi, just to make a few examples.  This led to the violation of the black people.  What was more apparent was that the police were not taking any action against the Inkatha in trying to force people to join them.  This made it so clear to us as the community that this was all a ploy, and it was a well-orchestrated plan.  Thus it did not come as a surprise that many of the places that were attacked during the Seven Days War were part of Vulindlela, which had many members who were aligned to the UDF and the ANC.  To count just a few, Taylor's Halt, Gezabuso, KwaShange, KwaMnyandu, as well as Inadi.  All these places made connections to be formed between Eden as well as Imbali, as well as the upper part.  That's why we believe that the attack that was orchestrated in these places was to prevent the UDF and the ANC so that they could not spread up to Vulindlela.  During that time of the intensification of violence is that the police were taking sides, because they were arresting UDF as well COSATU members, and they were not arresting Inkatha members.  One of the most important things that you must take note of in order to get a picture of the Seven Days War was that there were certain talks in 1987 between UDF as well as COSATU.  They were speaking with Inkatha, but the police came there during the negotiations and they arrested members of the UDF as well as COSATU and they left Inkatha members.  Now, this is what should be said and be put on record, that these talks of peace were initiated by UDF as well as COSATU.  Furthermore we should ask ourselves as to why these arrests were made and why did the police come to arrest UDF as well as COSATU members so that these talks may be derailed.  We believe that this was part of a plan that was well orchestrated that there should be no negotiations between Inkatha as well as the UDF, so that the apartheid government could use Inkatha as a tool, a tool to try and prevent the struggle of the people.  This is what made a background so that there could be Seven Days War later on.  We also believe that the Seven Day War was not an action initiated by the community, that they were throwing stones at the buses as it has been alleged, as we are saying we believe that it was part of a State security strategy at that time.   What makes us say that, here are things that we wish to point out to this honourable Commission in order to clarify these issues.  We can just say the police were part at all times of the problems that we were facing in 'Maritzburg.  The National Party, it was important for it that at all times it should make sure that there continue - the killings amongst blacks was a continuing thing, so that people would think that this was a black on black violence.  The second thing that you must take into consideration, each time that the police - as it gives us hope that some of them have already made statements with this regard and some were saying that their aim was to kill UDF as well as ANC members.  That is why even the police were the ones who were giving Inkatha money, or sponsoring the rallies, especially the rally which was on the 25th of March 1990.  It was paid for by the police as it has already been said.  What is more important that we see as the members of the ANC and that we wish to put forward to this honourable Commission is that the apartheid government as well as Inkatha, they had the same aim that UDF and ANC should not go forth.  The thing that is most important is that on the side of the apartheid government the apartheid government was helping and it was being helped by Inkatha, because it used to make Inkatha to be on the forefront of the violence.  This is what we believe that was the job of the then government, and the white people would say it's a black on black violence, which was actually orchestrated by them.  And, as I've already counted, it is very apparent that people in 'Maritzburg had decided now that they should join UDF/COSATU as well as the ANC, and Inkatha found this as a loophole to align themselves with the police so that their people would not be attacked and would not be few in 'Maritzburg.  One other thing that we wish to put forward to this Commission is to give a reason as to why we say that the Seven Days War was a war of apartheid.  We think that at the time of unbanning of the ANC caused some tension amongst other groups, because they did not know what would be the consequences of unbanning of the ANC.  Some feared that if the ANC was unbanned maybe it was going to align itself with Inkatha, so they wanted to make sure that at all times all these other organisations are in conflict with each other so that there might be no unity.  One other thing that makes us say this is that the Seven Day War, we have never seen a fight that broke out during the day but nobody would be arrested and nobody would pay any attention to this.  What the leaders of Inkatha as well as the police were doing, it showed that there was a culture of impunity and they could do anything without being arrested.  What was the cause of the Seven Days War?  As I have already pointed out, now I want to say - or point out the core or the reason of the whole war.  The Inkatha says the reason - as well as other people and top police officials were saying that it was because the buses were being stoned.  That is the buses which were carrying the Inkatha members, that is on the 25th of March 1990, whilst they were heading to a rally in Durban.  They said the buses towards Vulindlela were being stoned by the residents.  We do not believe as the ANC that such action took place.  We never got any evidence as to how far true these allegations were, and we do not believe that it was only the stoning of these buses that caused such havoc.  But some of the residents of Eden came to report to us that they were actually attacked by members of Inkatha who were travelling in that bus.  We do agree that at times there would be stoning of the buses.  We will not deny that, but according to our knowledge this usually was done by the youths who had run away from the upper part of the valley because they had been chased away by Inkatha because they were followers of the UDF as well as the ANC, and at times because they did not want to align themselves with the Inkatha. There are certain people who had been chased away because they were not members of Inkatha and they did not want anything to do with Inkatha, which means they were enemies of the Inkatha.  Some of our people had been tortured, had been traumatised, and the police did not help them in any way, and they were not even arresting the perpetrators.  One other thing that I wish to put before this Commission that had not yet surfaced was the stoning of the buses.  The history of the Inkatha, as well as the stoning of the buses, is a matter that should be viewed in a different light because in 1992, when the Inkatha was coming back from Durban, they went past KwaShange and they started shooting the residents.  And they went to report to the newspapers and the media that the bus was being attacked, but a later inquest revealed that in actual fact it was the direct opposite.  Now, when we look at this we must look at it critically from both points of view.  We should know that this is a blatant lie, and they are shielding themselves, they do not want to speak the truth.  They just wanted a reason as to why there was the start of the Seven Day War.  Let's agree that the buses were attacked on that particular day, but now the question that arises is now could there be such an attack simply because the buses were stoned?  So many people were killed later on. Could the stoning of the buses be that reason?  And thereafter we should ask ourselves as to why the places that were attacked were not the places where the stoning of the buses took place.  One other thing that we should take into consideration is that many people who got injured and who were killed were the women as well as the children and elderly people.  We do not want to believe that this category of people could have thrown stones at the buses.  Why was it necessary that people should be killed because of the throwing of stones?  These are just reasons that they used to kill people.  The question is, if the people who were attacking were saying they did this in retaliation because they were also attacked, then they are saying that they did attack, whether it was in retaliation or not.  And they are agreeing that they were planning, and it was a well orchestrated plan which was launched later on.  We want to put it before this Commission that the Seven Day War was a means to try and foment the violence that we have already talked about.  We want this Commission to look critically at this matter and ask itself as to why this fight or this war took place on the 25th March of 1990.  We, as the ANC members, believe that this was a well orchestrated plan, and it was planned by certain members of the apartheid system so that they could prevent the ANC from mobilising the people and making people to align themselves to it, because this happened hardly two months after the ANC had been unbanned.  This was quite an attack that we saw taking place throughout the world immediately after the ANC had been unbanned.  Because of that we see it's wise that this Commission should look at this matter critically, because the reason why the Seven Day War took place could have been linked to the unbanning of the ANC.  What did the other people or members of the Inkatha do?  Many of the people who were directly involved and directly affected, as well as eye witnesses, they have mentioned names of certain members or leaders of Inkatha who were prominent.  They mentioned the names of David Ntombela, Shayabantu Zondi, Gavaza Khanyile, Lololombo, as well as Philip Zondi.  We believe that these people who took part in these should be investigated by this Commission.  They should come forward to come and give an explanation as to what happened during the Seven Days War.  We are mainly expecting that the leaders should come and answer these questions.  The first question that we would like them to answer was that they knew or didn't they know about the attack before it took place?  All these people who had been mentioned were leaders in certain areas.  We find it very difficult that there could be such an attack when the members or leaders of Inkatha didn't know.  With regard to David Ntombela there is testimony that there was a meeting that was held at his place on a Monday, that's the 26th of March 1990, and that was a day before the attack.  The second question that I would like to ask this Commission that they should come forward answer to this Commission, what steps did they take in order to try and prevent the attack?  Are there any attempts that were made to prevent certain people from attacking?  Why didn't they take steps to get in touch with ANC/UDF as well as COSATU members in order to try and prevent the attacks, or why didn't they get connected with other members of the ANC besides the ones in 'Maritzburg?  Let me just remind you that there were certain talks between the UDF and Inkatha members.  This means that there were some connections through which there could be negotiations between these two particular groups in order to prevent the Seven Day War.  The other question that should be answered by these leaders is that did they ever report to the police of the imminent attack?  Did they ever tell the police that they should come and quell the situation, especially in preventing their followers from being attacked?  The other question that we want them to come and answer is that did they ever condemn the attack after it took place?  Did these leaders help the attackers to get arrested?  Now we are going back to the security forces, in particular the SAP, which was operating during that time.  For the ANC the fundamental questions revolve around the role played by the security forces in the conflict - the police conduct.  Firstly, were the security police aware of the planned attacks prior to them commencing?  We wish to say that we do not accept the fact that the police say they did not know that there was going to be an imminent attack.  The first point that we should bring forth is that the police were very quick to arrest ANC as well as UDF members.  The Flying Squad would arrest you at that very moment.  Now, they cannot come forward and tell us that they did not know that there was an imminent attack when there were so many people milling around, going around being armed and conducting meetings.  We also do not believe that the police did not know about the meeting that was held at Mr David Ntombela's house on the Monday, 26 March 1990.  The other question that we ask ourselves that the police should come and answer, why did not they know that there was a conflict in 'Maritzburg, and why didn't implement some plans to stop these attacks from taking place?  Why were the police or security forces unable to contain the attacks?  We do not believe that it could happen for seven days without the police not being able to contain the attacks.  The attack was KwaShange, KwaGezabuso, KwaMnyandu, Xalusa, Ashdown involved a large group of armed men, and they used to travel long distances during broad daylight.  The police had vehicles, as well as the soldiers.  Why didn't they prevent this march from taking place?  After the massive attacks on Tuesday the 27th March 1990 the police should have been able to foresee, even if we do agree or we don't agree, maybe they were taken by surprise, but during the attacks on the 27th they should have foreseen the consequences of the attack.  Why weren't they able to contain it?  What we find very difficult as the ANC is that there is not even a single person who was arrested.  As we have already said these attacks took place during broad daylight.  There was not even a single person who appeared in court and was acquitted.  The police had a culture of telling us the reason, but we do not accept the reason as the members of the ANC and as people who have got hindsight.  The police said they could not arrest the people because there were very few people who went to report to them with regard to  these attacks.  We think that this is an unacceptable reason.  When there's an attack during broad daylight for seven consecutive days why do - why should the police wait for the people to come and report to them?  Why can't they go out and investigate the matters?  General Buchner also went to a meeting of the Inkatha and he was listening to certain speakers who were addressing the meeting.  But there is a matter that is of fundamental importance that the Commission should look at, as to whether the police were able or not to quell that situation, because it is a known secret that the police had alliances with Inkatha.  Director Meyer, who had just given his testimony, it is very important for us to say that he was condemned by the Supreme Court Judge because of the relationship that existed between and Abdul Ahwed.  Superintendent J P van den Heever ... (incomplete - end of Side A, Tape 3) ... positions in the police force.  The question that we ask ourselves is if they had this relationship is it not what culminated to the Seven Day War?  In this new South Africa if these attacks were directed at Scottville, or Wembu or Priestbury I am not doubtful at all that it was not going to take more than an hour.  This shows us quite clearly, as members of the ANC, that the lives of black people were taken very cheaply during the apartheid era, and the Seven Day War is evidence to that.  To conclude we shall request this honourable Commission to investigate deeply about the role that was played by the police, as well as the soldiers, with regard to the seven day attack, especially the Flying Squad and the SBs.  In other places it has been shown that the SBs were directly involved in these attacks, and what troubles us most is that this branch of  the police force has never ever been investigated with regard to the attacks.  We do not believe that they conducted themselves in an orderly manner.  We wish that the Riot Unit should be further investigated, which was later on called the Stability Unit, and it was led by Major Terblanche, as well as the KwaZulu Police and the special constables.  What we want to say about these groups, as members of the ANC, is that even if they can give lengthy explanations and say that some of the police were acting on their own accord, we wish this Commission to investigate as to whether these groups which were existent under P W Botha, and they were called security management structures, and what was done by these groups was done in Pretoria, and it was known in Pretoria and well orchestrated.  We also wish this Commission to investigate as to what Jack Buchner's part was in all this, because he was also a high-ranking official in Pietermaritzburg.  We wish that he could also be investigated.  Before he came to 'Maritzburg there are some rumours that he was very connected with the Vlak Plaas.  During the Seven Day War Buchner was in charge of the ZP Police, and we know that the KwaZulu Police have got a very bad reputation, especially with regard to their conduct.  Some of the police, like Captain Brooks, Warrant-Officer Verber, as well as all the other high-ranking officials should be investigated, especially with regard to the part that they took during the Seven Day War, if they did.  We will not be free if these investigations do not take place as to what part did they play.  Honourable Chairman, as members of the ANC we believe that the names of the people who were directly  involved shall come forward on their own accord to come",

I am prepared to say this with no fear at all, and also prepared to say this over and over again.  It has never happened before seeing ANC gathering together, going to attack the Inkatha areas.  I will stand for that.  We've never done it before.  All the time it has been Inkatha gathering and coming to attack the ANC areas.  If the community was being attacked what happened also still even during this Seven Day War, the community itself, because of the attacks, especially the youth, would gather and create committees to prevent this.  We also agreed when we were making an agreement of peace accord in the Parliament that those committees are allowed, and should take place all the time people were being attacked.  Besides this there is nothing that ANC has done, because there's no one who will just fold his arms when he is being attacked.  Those committees were trying to prevent this, and also trying to defend themselves when the Inkatha and the police were coming to attack.  One other thing I would like to make mention of is that if there are ANC members who would gather together and plan to launch an attack at Inkatha areas, that definitely is not according to the constitution of ANC.  That will obviously mean they were up to killing, and we've never had people in the past who would have those intentions.

Secondly, fighting with the apartheid government UDF used weapons like boycotts, or means like boycotts, stay-aways.

When he said the UDF was formed in 1983, and it took police and some other government servants as enemies, I think he made a mistake there.  I think the police made UDF an enemy instead.  That was clear, and it is clear even now.  There is no point of me dwelling in that one.  If they took us for an enemy, doing those things that Mr Harrington has already explained, that they were telling the special constables to shoot randomly in ANC places, then it was called for for UDF to do something.  Were they supposed to fold their arms when the special constables were shooting their areas and their mothers?  Mr Keys should have said police said UDF are its enemies, not vice versa.  I would not say the police and the government servants were enemies, because we do have a majority of people who were serving the government in different areas, and were UDF members, and they were always part of the community where UDF held a strong position.  It was - our enemy was not people as individuals, but an enemy of UDF was a group and the organisation of apartheid.  That I will not deny and repudiate.  But some police were in the community, belonged to the community, but who had done nothing  because they did carry their duties right, so ...

If it's true the followers of UDF and ANC were forced to be their members today they should have opened up and disclosed that information that they were made and forced to be members of these organisations.  As I am speaking today we have won two-thirds here in Pietermaritzburg.  At the same time I do not want to refute the fact that at times there will be people, some belonging to UDF and ANC, who will want to force things to be done, but I will say those things were happening there and there, and even in our statements that we used to give out we made it clear, explicitly clear, that we were not forcing people, and we don't at the same time repudiate the fact that there were instances like that, and we would condemn such actions and such things.

If I go back to the discussions of 1987, the businessmen did take part in those discussions.  I will say without doubt or hesitance that some of them did try to prevent these attacks, because they were the ones who suffered the most because people could not go to work.  In other words I would wish - I don't know whether that I have missed some other thing since I did not attend before.  We know about Pietermaritzburg Chamber of Commerce then, and Chamber of Industries, that should come.  We know about those, and should come forward and present, and especially that they were there when the police came to arrest the members of COSATU and UDF.  They have witnessed everything and have seen everything. Especially COSATU was the one which helped at all times to push and put pressure to the companies to play some role in light of solving the problem.

And that is a pity, because it would be very important to have had the IFP account of those days.  And the IFP must then live with the consequences of refusing to come to this Commission.  I am glad that the ANC has admitted that, for example, there was stoning of buses in Edendale by young refugees from Vulindlela, and this certainly does explain the anger of those IFP people from Elandskop and Vulindlela.  What we have to ask ourselves is whether it was appropriate then to launch what amounted to an invasion on the surrounding areas, along with the mass destruction of life and property that went along with it.

During the period of violence in the Edendale area, which was then commonly known as Death Valley, I served as a lieutenant in the South African Police, and second in charge to the commander of the Riot Investigation Unit at that time.  During that period 87-91 I regard as the worst outbreaks of violence in the Pietermaritzburg/Midlands area.  The incident referred to as the Seven Day War during March/April 1990 was in fact in my experience the most serious series of violence during that period.  Prior to the Seven Day War I was on investigation in the Natal Midlands.  I looked at my diary, and the date was the 23rd of March 1990.  Whilst in the New Hanover area I saw approximately six bus loads of people coming from the direction of Greytown.  The buses were fully laden with people, and they were armed with weapons.  At that stage I used to conduct inspections and investigations throughout the Natal Midlands as far afield as Greytown and Wartburg.  Being curious I stopped the lead bus and inquired as to what was going on.  I learned that they were IFP supporters that were en route to a meeting in Edendale.  I then contacted the Riot Unit and informed them of the situation.  I was asked at that stage to allow them through.",

You see, at that stage whenever the police had seen anything with regard to crowds or people in groups or large gatherings we reported it to the Riot Unit.  And because of this peculiar incident of six buses coming towards 'Maritzburg it had raised my suspicion and therefore I had contacted them.  During the investigation at the Riot Investigation Unit we experienced a number of problems with regard to investigation.  There was no co-operation from people, from both the UDF and the IFP sides.  During the Seven Day War I myself attended a number of scenes of murders.  The areas in which the murders had occurred were deserted at that stage, and we had received no information from the people when called upon to do so.  During that period, 1990, shortly after the Seven Day War, I investigated a number of killings, numbering about between 20 and 24 murders and attempted murders, where a serial killer was convicted and sentenced to seven life terms of imprisonment.  During the same period, the same year in October, I also investigated the killing of Ololo Lombo, who I knew at that stage was seen in the vicinity of the Seven Day War killings, and arrested the - the suspects or the killers of Mr Lombo were arrested on the same day and appeared in court.  They subsequently escaped and went abroad.  Mr Chairman, ironically I have re-arrested them two weeks ago and they are now awaiting trial.  Soon after these incidents of investigation I was called up to at that stage regional headquarters in Durban, and paraded before the then General Steyn, who was the head of the Security Branch in KwaZulu Natal.  When I introduced myself to him he called me a communist dog, and he informed me that I was being followed, and that the Security Branch had been keeping surveillance on me for about a year.

It indicates that a single policeman driving a motor vehicle could, by the authority that he represented, could have stopped a large convoy of armed men.  Because the story that we have heard from the other policemen here is that they were completely unable to do anything to halt the movement of armed people during that period, and other people have said that there was a great unwillingness on the part of the police to stop those armed groups.  And you have indicated that it could be done.

Due to atrocities done by white policemen in Imbali at night we were asked to come and monitor the situation.  A group was formed, who stayed overnight in threatened houses, made reports, and tried to prevent further incidents.  On the evening of Thursday, the 29th March ... (Inaudible - end of Side B, Tape 4) ... days earlier when Graham had stayed in the house of police torture victim, Larry Silwane.  Incidentally, may I include that that policeman confessed, that is Mr Harrington.  He confessed, and he is forgiven.  When we reached the area of Imbali Breweries Graham watched a black car, allegedly belonging to Councillor Awetha, to do a sudden U-turn and then following us closely.  Graham accelerated, and suddenly it turned up a street, when a shot hit the rear end of the car.  We drove fast to the house of our destination.  The black car roared up the next street.  Everybody ran into the house.  I had left my handbag and camera in the car, and swiftly went to retrieve it.  There was no time now for me to run into the house.  I quickly had to duck behind the thigh-high garden wall.  I thank God for that garden wall.  Mr Mlotshwa was standing behind a pillar.  Through the ornamental holes in the wall I could see everything clearly.  Three rather handsome young men came up through the bushes on the empty plot opposite the house carrying an R1 rifle.  The older of the youth handled this gun skilfully.  He struck me as being well trained.  He went around the car and shot and shot and shot, first into the tyres, then into the front and rear windows.  He repeatedly shot into the petrol tank, but it did not explode.  The cheek with which they moved about showed me clearly that they were certain that nobody in the surrounding houses had guns.  They could have shot them 10 times over.  I was so mad at them, and sitting so close that the thought came up that I could easily photograph them.  I grasped my camera, a flash went off, leaving me terrified and them running off.  Meanwhile the occupants of the house had huddled together on mattresses in the pitch dark passages.  Many people had been shot through the windows.  As soon as the first shot ran out they phoned the police, the families, and the newspaper.  The police arrived three hours later with four squad cars.  They wanted us to enter the completely gutted car immediately and leave Imbali with their escort.  When they realised this was impossible they wanted to take us in the police vans.  The hosts were very afraid of a petrol bomb attack in case we left, so we had to sign a statement that we had refused to be rescued from this dangerous township.  About half an hour later we saw huge flames.  Graham's car was burning fiercely.  This time the police did not take so long.  They were four young men from Transkei, who hardly could speak English and were pleased to be able to talk Afrikaans to me.  After a while, having asked many questions, one of them said an amazing thing to me.  \"What I see here and what I am told on TV does not click.  Why does the Government lie so much to the people on TV?\"  Again I realised that one policeman is very different from the next.  ",

            "We, as a Commission, have not had time to analyse the evidence and to draw conclusions or to make findings, and all I will do here is to briefly summarise the evidence and to look at some of the trends and the patterns that the evidence points to.\n We've been looking at the week from 26th March to 4th April 1990, and I think that it can safely be said that this week was not a good week for the people of the Edendale valley.  We have heard evidence in vivid detail from both victims and perpetrators that the people of this valley were subjected to an armed invasion by thousands of heavily armed men, resulting in 200 residents of that valley being murdered, hundreds of houses being looted and destroyed, stock driven off, and 30 000 refugees being created, many of whom are still homeless today.\n For the people of places like Ashdown, Xaluza, Mpumuza, Gezabuso, KwaShange, KwaMnyandu, it was undoubtedly the most terrifying experience that they had ever and will ever undergo.  Several witnesses said that this was not a war, because a war implies a battle of equals.  One witness said it was a political cleansing, while another said it was an armed invasion.\n Just as that week was a bad week for the people of the Edendale valley, so also was this week a bad week for three organisations, the Defence Force, the SAP, South African Police, and the Inkatha Freedom Party.  Many witnesses who have testified over the past four days, people who were both victims and perpetrators, pointed fingers at these three organisations, and I will look briefly at each one of them.\n With regard to the Defence Force, Brigadier Swanepoel said that the role that he was given by the police to play in the Seven Day War was to ensure that the Edendale Road was kept open, so that Edendale or Vulindlela residents could get to work without being stoned.  He confirmed that at no stage were his troops deployed in the upper valley, where the destruction was taking place.  He confirmed that if his troops had been stationed there they could have prevented loss of life and destruction of property.  Residents of these areas, journalists and violence monitors pleaded with the Defence Force to deploy what forces they had in the areas where the attacks were taking place, but the SADF did not respond. The reason that Brigadier Swanepoel gave was that the plan that had been worked out by the Joint Management Centre did not provide for the deployment of troops in the unrest area.  This may appear to many of us to be unbelievable, but I believe that that is what in fact happened.  The Joint Operations Centre decided that the army should only be deployed to keep open the Edendale road.  There is no doubt that vehicles were being stoned on that road before the Seven Day War, but there has been no evidence that any political party was responsible for the stoning, and it seems that it was probably young people who had been driven away from their homes at Elandskop and Vulindlela.  \n Brigadier Swanepoel and Director Meyer of the police contradicted themselves as to whether the Defence Force was sufficiently resourced to enable it to enter the upper reaches of the valley where the real trouble was taking place.  Brigadier Swanepoel said that the Defence Force was hopelessly understaffed, whereas Director Meyer said the SADF resources were quite adequate.  One thing is certain, is that if the six armoured vehicles and the 100 soldiers which the army did have had been deployed in the valley there seems to be no doubt that a substantial proportion of the death and destruction could have been averted, and Brigadier Swanepoel agreed to this.  Another thing is certain, if army reinforcements had been called in immediately the Seven Day War could have been averted altogether.\n This brings us to the role of the police.  Director Meyer presented the official version of the South African Police, and he portrayed the police as being completely impartial and unbiased, and as having done everything possible to prevent loss of life and damage to property.  On the other hand the version from Special Constables Shabangu and Madlala, and a Riot Unit Constable Harrington, was one of open complicity on the part of the police with the IFP forces.  \n Shabangu said that he drove a Riot Unit vehicle to pick up special constables;  that he met up with a large Inkatha crowd, including Mr David Ntombela;  that he went with this group to the outskirts of KwaShange, and there he watched with other members of his Riot Unit as the special constables attacked, burned and looted houses at KwaShange, and returned with stolen property, which they loaded onto a police vehicle, which was then driven to Mr Ntombela's home, along with cattle which had been stolen from the residents of KwaShange.  \n Mr Radley Keys and Mr Pierre Cronje, then of the Democratic Party, testified that they had watched a 3 000 strong IFP group prepare for an attack on Xalusa.  They said that the police, under Brigadier Viljoen, sat in their armoured vehicles and silently watched while that saga unfolded before their eyes.  They said that only after very strenuous argument on their part did the police very reluctantly begin to intervene to ward off that impi.   Other witnesses testified to watching in disbelief as police provided buckets of ammunition to Inkatha combatants.\n During the course of his evidence Director Meyer did make some significant concessions.  He said that it was probable that some special constables had participated in the violence, but that if they did so it was contrary to the instructions of senior officers.  He said that it was possible that arms and ammunition had been given by the police to IFP combatants, but that if they did so it was contrary to the instructions of senior officers.  He said that he could not account for the participation of the KwaZulu Police in the Seven Day War on the side of the IFP, and said that the KwaZulu Police were part of a different command structure.  \n When he was asked why no legal action had been taken against IFP leaders like Mr Ntombela, and many others who were alleged to have been involved in violence, he said that prosecutions may well have been instituted against them had there not been intimidation of witnesses.  He said that he could not deny the evidence of Constable Harrington, who said that as a member of the Riot Unit he had participated in many serious crimes, including murder, the sale of weapons to the IFP, torture, assaults, and the use of police vehicles to transport IFP members to attack UDF areas.  He also conceded that the creation and the deployment of the special constables was one of the most fundamental mistakes which the South African Police had made.\n With regard to the role of the special constables generally, I do not believe that Director Meyer was frank with the Commission.  Evidence has been given before this Commission by several other people, not only witnesses at this hearing, but other witnesses, that the special constables were specifically recruited, trained and deployed to act against the UDF/ANC and to support Inkatha.  I have no reason to disbelieve Constable Madlala, Shabangu and Harrington when they say this, and I also have no reason to disbelieve ex-police Captain Brian Mitchell, who has given evidence under oath to this Commission, when he says that special constables were in fact the so-called third force during that time in the entire Midlands area, and that the sole purpose of the special constables was for them to be deployed offensively against members of the UDF, and to support and assist the IFP.  \n Constable Harrington told the Commission that while he and some special constables were braai-ing meat and drinking beer in the Table Mountain area with an IFP group another IFP group launched an attack on a nearby ANC settlement.  Instead of intervening and stopping the attack, or investigating the attack, or even observing the attack, Harrington and the Riot Unit and the special constables continued to eat and drink, after having been assured by their IFP hosts that it was merely an attack by IFP on UDF people.  He said that that attitude and that behaviour was typical of the work of the Riot Unit and the special constables during that time.  He said that he routinely assaulted and tortured people, threw people from the back of police vehicles, used his police vehicle to transport IFP people to UDF areas to carry out attacks, confiscated weapons from UDF areas, and gave them or sold them to IFP members.  He said that this was commonplace behaviour in the Riot Unit, and that it was done by many of the Riot Unit members.\n I accept that after the death of Major Terblanche the official attitude towards the ... (inaudible - end of Side A, Tape 5) ... Erasmus and Madlala to have taken place.  However, I cannot believe that the police hierarchy in the Midlands did not have a full appreciation of what the special constables actually were, and what they were to be used for.\n With regard to the investigations into the deaths caused by the Seven Day War, we have heard the evidence of Inspector Bongani Nxumalo this afternoon, and it is clear that those investigations were completely inadequate.  \n Finally we look at the role of the IFP.  Almost\nevery witness who has appeared before this Commission,  other than the SAP and the SADF, laid the blame for this terrible event at the feet of IFP members.  The IFP have not given us an official account of its involvement in the Seven Day War.  As I said earlier on a letter was sent to the Premier, Mr Mdlalose - sorry, Dr Mdlalose, and to Mr Jiyani - Dr Jiyani, sorry, inviting them to send someone to give an official account of the IFP to this Commission, and a reply was received from Mr van der Merwe saying that the IFP had made its submission in Cape Town some months ago to the Commission, and that it did not intend making any further submission.  Now, I was present in Cape Town when the IFP made its submission, and in the several hundred pages of submissions that it made to the Truth Commission it did not make mention of the Seven Day War, or of any incident or event which took place during that period, and that is the route that the IFP has chosen.\n Mr Ntombela was invited to give evidence before this Commission.  The Commission had originally agreed to subpoena Mr Ntombela to come to this Commission in the same way that it subpoenaed many other witnesses, but we decided that we should rather first invite Mr Ntombela out of respect for his public office.  He initially accepted the invitation, but on the day that he was due to appear he refused to give evidence, and instead he called for the dismissal of the entire panel as it was constituted for this hearing.\n I should also place on record that a couple of weeks before the hearing a senior IFP member went onto the Zulu language radio and said that if Mr Ntombela was subpoenaed\nto appear at this hearing that the city of  Pietermaritzburg would be plunged into darkness.  Mr Ntombela has requested that we make available to him copies of the witnesses' statements in order to allow him to formulate his response to the allegations made against him, and he is entitled to those documents.  And he has told us that he will be responding to those documents, and until such time as he has done so I will not make further comment on his role, except to say that he has been implicated by many witnesses in this terrible tragedy.\n In conclusion I want to look at a hypothetical scenario.  Let us imagine for some bizarre reason that the black residents of Imbali swept out in a huge group of 3 000 people and attacked the white suburban residents of Pietermaritzburg, killing them, burning their houses, stealing their property.   We would not have seen a few police Casspirs driving around negotiating with the Imbali residents, escorting them back to Imbali.  We would not have seen the South African Defence Force confined to its base, or deployed to keep a road open, and we would not have seen members of the Riot Unit sunning themselves in the gardens of Imbali leaders.  What we would have seen if this had happened was the mass deployment of thousands and thousands of policemen and soldiers.  We would have seen hundred of armoured vehicles in the streets and helicopters in the sky.  We would have seen a mobilisation of resources as never before seen in this country, and we would have seen hundreds of people arrested and tried and convicted for murder, theft, armed robbery, arson, and other serious crimes.  \n And this is what should have happened in the\nEdendale valley.  This is what the residents of the  Edendale valley were entitled to expect from the police, but because they were poor, and because they were black, and because they represented what Director Meyer called the UDF/COSATU alliance, they did not get that help.  And we hope that those days have passed.\n Finally I just want to thank all the various people who have worked hard during this past week to make this hearing proceed as it did.  I want to thank the witnesses, because without them we would not have had a hearing.  We want to thank them for their courage and bravery in coming forward.  We want to thank the special Truth Commission task team which worked so hard to pull all these witnesses together, and the other TRC staff members who also worked very hard.  We want to thank the police for protecting this building, the interpreters who interpreted for us, the press, and the many other voluntary people who worked so hard to make this hearing a success.  Also thanks to the media in general for their coverage and their hard work.\n Please, as you leave the hall please do so with respect and dignity that this occasion demands.  We thank you very much for your attendance.\n Before we part please let's not forget that each time we gather we don't part before singing a cultural song or traditional song.  We came together in this fashion, talking about those who've left us, who died, and simply depart easily like that.  Let's stand up so we can sing a traditional song or some kind of a song.\n/TRANSCRIBER'S",
