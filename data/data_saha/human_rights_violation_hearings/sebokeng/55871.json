            "In 1992 at 4000 Sharpeville we were asleep at 2 o'clock in the morning and the windows were shattered and the doors were breaking. Then we decided to wake up.  When I was in the passage I saw these four young men.  It was myself, Tabo Mosebe and Kenneth Nto.  I wanted to open the door. The windows were continually being shattered.  When I tried to open the door the door just opened itself.  A White man came in and he picked me by my shoulder.  Tabiso went behind him and he went outside.  I released myself from him and then he got straight into the bedroom.  I followed him and a large number of boers also came into the house.  When he came from the bedroom he had Rangwane and Tabo in his\nHRV/1051 hands/...\n2\nhands.  I passed them.  I got into the bedroom.  Before I could enter the bedroom I heard a loud bang behind me.  I didn't know what sound it was and I got into the bedroom.  My child was putting the blankets on himself.  Kenneth wanted to hide himself in the wardrobe.  I said Kenneth please get out.  He said mum I am scared.  I left them in the bedroom with my daughter and I went out through the kitchen door and I stood at the stoep.  They asked me are the boys all out of the house?  I said no there is only one left.  They said tell him to get out.  I told him that he is scared that you are going to shoot him and they said no.  I said to Kenny, Kenny please get out of the house I will accompany you.  The two of us got out of the house and we stood at the stoep and they said to him he should go to the street.  I went back to the house to check as to the whereabouts of my daughter.  She was still roaming in the house not knowing what to do.  We were puzzled.  We didn't know what was happening.\n Before they could get into the house I must say that they kicked the door, but the door couldn't open and then they kicked it in the middle and then there was a big hole.  Then when we got into the dining room this door was having a big hole and this boer was having a teargas canister in his hand, releasing it into the house.  We went into the kitchen to get the water.  You know my daughter was wearing a very short nightdress and she didn't have shoes.  They said we don't have to get into the house we must go outside into the street very close to the Combi where Kenny was standing, and they said we shouldn't say anything.  The boers were full in my yard, surrounding my house.\n After quite a few minutes they said we should get into \nHRV/1051 the/...\n3\nthe Combi.  They will bring us back together with my daughter, we must go to the police station to tell them exactly what happened.  I said to them can you please get into the house so that we get dressed.  They said don't mind we are bringing you back.  We got into the Combi, they drove with us to a police station in Vereeniging, they interrogated us.  They were throwing harsh words to us.  They took us back into the Combi, they drove us to Houtkop police station. We spent some time there, and after a few minutes they said you are now going.  When we got outside three cars were parking.  They put me into the other car, Kenny into another one and my daughter into the last one.  And we were so surprised as to what was happening because they separated us.  They took me to the police station at Vanderbijl Park, it was on a Friday, I didn't know where my child was, I didn't know where Kenny was.  It was weekend.  You know the family searched all over for us.  They couldn't find us. \n On Monday we went to court.  The case was postponed.  We were told that it would sit on the 3rd of February.  We were taken to Vereeniging Police station.  We were kept there.  On Tuesday we got visitors and that was the first time we heard that Tabo and Ndlangwane had been shot dead and Tabiso was in the hospital deadly injured.  On the 3rd we went back to court.  When we arrived at the court the case was just destroyed.  When - myself and my daughter we were now the witnesses on behalf of the dead ones.  Tabiso was still in the hospital.  It was myself and Kenny going up and down to the court of law, but Kenny was given a R1 000 bail.  We attended the court continually until Tabiso was discharged from hospital.  The three of us then went to the \nHRV/1051 case/...\n4\ncase and then I heard that Kenny was killed in Gauteng.  \nTabiso was now sentenced to four years because he was guilty.  He is still inside serving his sentence.",

I think I would just also like to add that what happened that night also had repercussions of course, that on that night Rangwane Lefedi and Tabo Mosebe were killed in Sharpeville.  Three months later eight\nHRV/1051 members/...\n9\nmembers of the same Lefedi family were shot dead by unknown people in Sharpeville.  It is alleged that the women were raped before being shot.  The Lefedi family had complained on a number of occasions about the police intimidation and harassment following the death of their eldest son Rangwane Lefedi in January '92 during a shoot-out with the South African Police.  Rumours of Ketisi/Kwamadala Resident involvement the sole survivor of the attack claimed that killers had said they were from Kwamadala.  Do your remember any of this?",
