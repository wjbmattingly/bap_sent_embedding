            "I will start by saying in July up to the 30th of August I was not present.  I had gone to Copenhagen.  I only came here on the 30th of August.  I stayed, that is Saturday and Sunday the 1st and the 2nd, on the 3rd when I was at home in Zone 3 and I was in the house when I heard some noise outside.  And the distance was about 500 metres.  I went outside to investigate as to what was happening.  I saw a group of people coming towards my direction and they were shouting.  I listened to them and they were saying they wanted Sonny Mofekeng and I tried to get a look at those people.  They were armed with pangas as well as knopkieries heading towards my direction.\n And I went into the house.  I told my wife what was \nHRV/1048 happening/...\n2\nhappening outside.  I also told my three children that I had seen people armed and coming towards my direction singing that they wanted Sonny Mofekeng and I warned them that we should escape for our lives.  I opened the car, I put my children as well as my wife in the car because at that time my wife was expectant.  I opened the car for her and we drove out and we took the direction towards Everton.  And at approximately 500 metres I stopped because I wanted to see the people who said they wanted Sonny Mofekeng.  When they got to my house it was quite a distance from where I was and they were pelting my house with stones.  I realised at that moment that it was not safe for me and my family to be in that place.  We had better escape.  And I drove off in my car heading towards Houtkop.  \n When I got to Houtkop I reported the matter to the police.  I told the police that my house was being stoned and I was requiring safety.  And I was lucky enough because they accepted me at Houtkop, and as I was still at Houtkop I heard over the radio, they were announcing that Siza Mucheane and Chakane had been killed.  At that moment I started panicking because I realised at that point that my life was also in danger so it was worth my while to escape at that moment.  I stayed at Houtkop up till the evening.   At about 9 o'clock in the evening I heard another announcement over the radio they were telling the public that my house was on fire and I asked the police at Houtkop to accompany me to my house because I wanted to really verify that it was burning.  They told me that it was not safe for me to go to my house.  But in any case they took me along.  We went to Etan side so that they could take me to Zone 3.  And when we got to Residentia, that is the bridge\nHRV/1048 that/...\n3\nthat leads to Residentia, we stopped there and I had a good look.  It was during the night.  I saw the flames, very big flames emanating from my house, and I saw another fire, a big fire just next to my house and that was my father's house.  That's where he stayed next to me.  As we were still watching about 500 metres from my house, that's where my garage was, that is the filling station, I also saw it being set alight and I saw big flames looming at my garage.  And I told the police that they should take me back to Houtkop.",

I have never used my revolver, not at all, I have never, that is why I decided to take my children, to take them to a safe place.

Your testimony also is very valuable to us to help piece together the whole picture of what happened in Vaal Triangle in those difficult years.  I am under the impression of the suffering not only from the community but the suffering from the councillors' side, the pain and the anguish the families must have gone through, when you talked about your father's house that was also burnt, about your children, we have very much sympathy with you, not only the loss of property but the danger that you lived in.  And I do hope, I really hope that the time will come soon that you will be able to go back to your place to\nHRV/1048 rebuild/...\n11\nrebuild it and to find your place again in your community.  Thanks for coming again and I wish you well.  You may leave the podium, thank you.",
