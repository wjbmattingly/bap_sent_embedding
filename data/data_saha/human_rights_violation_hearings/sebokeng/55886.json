This happened at the Erica Tavern in Zone 7 on July the 7th and there were five people killed and 14 injured.  We in fact have the names, unlike other situations we have mentioned we have the names of the people who also died there.  There was Tebogo, there was Kwinamabe Zinka, Charles Ngalo, Shadreck and one other person.  From the information we have Mrs Khosi, and I don't know whether this will help you, and I hope we will be able to share that information with you as well, that a certain Mr Thabo Mofokeng from the Kwamadala Hostel was arrested and charged.  Also charged was a Mr Darky Chonko.  So these two people were charged. I don't know what the outcome was.  We will let you know and I hope that will give you some peace.  You came today to come and talk to us about the loss of one son.  But you have also told us that another very important person in your family died in a car accident on Tuesday.
