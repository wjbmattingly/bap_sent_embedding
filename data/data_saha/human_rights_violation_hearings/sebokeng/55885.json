            "It was in September in the morning on a Monday, but he was shot in the evening at the hostel. Or there was a shooting on a Sunday evening, it was an Inkatha shooting.  Then on Monday in the morning my husband heard rumours that there was a shooting at the hostel.  We had relatives at the hostel because we are Xhosa and we come from the rural areas.  Then he came to tell me that he was going to the hostel to go and investigate, see if the relatives were not injured.  He went out, it was at about eight in the morning, then he went heading to the hostel.  As soon as he had gone out I felt that I should also follow\nHRV/810 but/...\n2\nbut I had my doubts.  Then he got to the hostel and there Inkatha had been inside the hostel.  There were clothes inside the hostel but I don't know what hostel it was that the Inkatha was there and they were watching the Inkatha so that they could not escape and at that time soldiers came to the vicinity.  They told them to come to a particular spot and they must sit down.  They said they must sit down and be calm.  Then they sat down.  They knelt on their knees at that moment, as they were still on their knees after a few moments they were sprayed with teargas, they sprayed teargas on them as they were still kneeling.  According to my child who was there she told me that she saw her father who was at a distance and the teargas affected their eyes and they were trying to run away from the teargas.  That is when my husband got shot.  It was on a Monday.  There was no transport because there was some sort of a boycott on that particular Monday.  There was absolutely no transport at that time.  My elder child asked me where the father was and I explained that the father had gone to the hostel and I knew nothing.  He also went out to go and see his friends  then he came back and asked whether the father had not come back.  I said the father had not come back.  Then he started shaking.  Then he started telling me that it meant that whatever he saw was the truth but I didn't know what he was referring to.  He went out the door.  I took a R2,00 coin and my intention was to head for the hostel because I also wanted to investigate as to what had actually happened.",

            "I took a R2,00 coin and I went outside of the\nHRV/810 house/...\n3\nhouse and I went towards the tarred road, that is the main road because I thought there was transport and my intention was to go to the hostel.  I stood for quite a long time there waiting for the taxi and I saw there was some violence.  There was absolutely no calm.  At that time a youth appeared and asked me what I was doing there.  I went on my feet to the hostel because there was absolutely no transport.  When I got to the hostel I could not see anything amiss, I could not see any people.  I went back into the house, it was on a Monday and on Tuesday we went to search for him at the hospital.  We could not get him.  Then on a Wednesday we went back to the hospital and we tried to search for him, but we just could not get him anywhere.  Then we heard a rumour that if I couldn't get him at the hospital I might as well try to look at the mortuary.  Then I went to the mortuary to search for my husband and I got him.  He was dead.  As a person who disappeared on a Monday what was happening through all these other days because I only got him on a Thursday, what was happening to him all these other days?  Because I got him on a Thursday and he was dead already.\n We went to Transkei to bury my husband.  We stayed in Transkei and my eldest son who had seen the whole incident taking place came back to Johannesburg.  After quite some time we received a call that we were wanted in Johannesburg because the culprit who had shot my husband had been arrested, and we were wanted.  We had to appear in court.  My eldest son went to court.  The case was remanded and we were told that we would be notified.  We waited and waited to be called to go to court but up till today we haven't been called. But we got a Vaal Vision newspaper, we read it, HRV/810 that/...\n4\nthat my husband had been killed by John Booysen who was a soldier.\n Now my question is as he had been instructed to sit down and be calm why was he shot because he was not fighting?  \n The second question is at the time that he was shot he was kneeling down, he was on his knees, what had he done?  And after he had shot him, knowing fully well that he had shot him, why didn't he come to us to notify us that my husband had been shot and killed, because I had to go up and down trying to look for my husband.  My children had to go out of the school because I had problems financially.  Even today I still encounter problems.  Now I have told myself that I am a widow because of Booysen.  What was all the reason behind this?  \n Now I will request this Commission, I just want to tell this Commission that I do not have much to say but I want my eldest son who was there to elaborate because he saw this incident taking place.",

            "On that day I woke up early in the morning.  I left my mother in the house and I went outside.  I came across people who were telling me that the Zulus had been arrested at the hostel.  I was very interested to see what was actually happening because it was going to be my first day.  I went to the hostel.  I don't know what the name of the hostel is but that block was the Railway Block.  And we got there we saw them wearing overalls.  They were inside and they were surrounded by police.  As we were still standing there I saw my father, but I really doubted to go to him.  Then I went to the other side of the road and I peeped through the hole to see the whole incident.  And the Zulus were right inside the hostel.  As we were still watching all that was happening just behind us there came a soldiers Caspir and we turned around to face them to see what they had come to do.  They got out of their Caspirs, nobody threw any stones at them, nobody was aggressive, we were just peeing through the hole to see what was happening at the hostel.  All of them got out of the Caspirs and they formed sort-of a guard of honour and they were facing us.  Just at that moment there was a group, we were a group, there were many of us, and we were facing them.  We restrained ourselves, we told ourselves that we should just sit down.  My father at that moment was at a distance which\nHRV/810 I/...\n6\nI could equate to the door that I am looking at.  As we were sitting down, because there were many of us, we were all sitting down from the front up to the back, just before the last row at the back sat down we just heard a loud explosion and we realised that we were being thrown with a teargas canister.  And out of the corner of my eye I could see my father because he was at a distance.  And I didn't want to really face him because somehow I was scared.  I saw him, it was as if he was trying to stand up and at that particular moment I ran away.  \n Just when I was on the other side of the street I had this doubt, I suspected that my father was trying to stand up but now I can't see him anywhere.  And now he was right at the front.  Now he could not have been able to walk quite quickly.  At that moment I was very confused.  I didn't know what to think.  I asked myself whether he was able to stand and run away, but I told myself at the same moment that he was an elderly man and he could not run as fast as we could.   I went back to look for my father, and when I went there I looked but I could not see any trace that he was there.  I ran around trying to look for him but I could not find him anywhere.  I kept on looking and I had this doubt in my mind that my father couldn't have run away.  Probably something happened to him because he's an elderly man and he looked like he had a problem standing up and he had a very big build.  And I felt in my heart of hearts that something had happened.  \n I went straight home and I asked my mother whether my father had come back.  My mother said no he hadn't yet come back.  I didn't tell my mother.",
