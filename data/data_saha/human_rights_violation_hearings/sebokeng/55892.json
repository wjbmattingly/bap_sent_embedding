            "It was on a Sunday the 8th September 1984.  It was about six o'clock in the evening.  I was at my friend's place, we were talking to each other.  As we were just talking a group came from the other direction running and he asked me do you have an idea why are they running.  I said to him no and as they were running he said I want to go inside the house and then he went to the front side of the house.  When I approached the corner I only heard a blow on the head and it was from a gun.  I was shot.  I fell and I was asking myself what is happening.  And the whites were around me trampling on me, kicking me\nHRV/824 and/...\n2\nand they even sprayed their tear-gas on my face.  They were trampling on me, they were kicking me.  I don't have some of the teeth in my mouth.  As I was lying on the ground they were continually tear-gassing me.  I cannot see as I am talking to you now.  I am blind.  I have been to many doctors and they said to me you will never see until you die.  After shooting me my mother came, Sidiso actually ran to my place to inform my parents that I had been shot and he explained that we were together with him talking and then he doesn't know why the police shot at us.  When my mother arrived the police shot the tear-gas again.  And every time - I wanted to ask what was happening because I was unconscious.  Instead of taking me to the hospital they took me to Houtkop police station and they threw me on the floor and my mother arrived because she drove in a hippo.  And she said to them I thought you were taking my son to the hospital.  I don't know what happened but when I regained conscious I was at the hospital.  And you know I was guarded by police just like a bandit.  I couldn't speak anything, I couldn't say a word.  Now the Sebokeng Hospital actually held me.  They operated me on the head because a bullet, these big bullets you know one of them got into my head.  In winter I battle a lot.  I have a terrible headache in winter.  And I cannot see.  You know even if you want to visit friends you cannot walk on your own.  I am doing nothing, I am just at home.  I am not working. You know I try to get employment and every time I would be told how will I work.  I am now dependent on the government fund and I go to doctors.  Every time I don't feel well I go to the doctor and I have to pay.  I have given up home.  The person who did this to me I have forgiven him, I have really\nHRV/824 forgiven/...\n3\nforgiven him.  This is the kind of life that I am now leading.  My mom is here with me and she is also sick.  She witnessed the whole thing as I was in the hospital.  That is at Sebokeng Hospital.  And she was running up and down.  We have been to doctors and she said with the grace of God you will be okay.  And I said to her Mom I have accepted this, what will I do.  I am like this and I will stay like this.  You know at times if there is nobody to accompany me to whatever place I would like to go to I have to stay at home.  That is the life that I am now used to.  Now the day, the 8th September every year when it is about that time I feel very disturbed.  I cannot work, I cannot do anything.  I am used to this kind of life here in the Vaal Triangle because at the hospital they know me.  Every time I go in they would say how do you do and I would say I am just fine.  I am used to this kind of life.  They shot me and I am used to this kind of life.  But these people who did this to me I say to the Lord, Lord forgive them, they didn't know what they were doing.  I am thankful that I am still alive like any other human being.  You know when the weather is cloudy, as it is now, I get pains because the operation is not that well.  I would take pain tablets but they wouldn't help and I would feel this head of mine carrying a lot of weight.  You know I would spend the whole day sleeping and the people would say please wake up, you know take some few walks so that you can stretch your body.  There are blind schools available but I couldn't go because of finance.  Because they want their money cash.  They don't think of bursaries, they don't think of any kind of assistance.  I have tried many bursaries but to no avail.  When I heard that the Commission was coming to our area, you know I have been\nHRV/824 asking/...\n4\nasking myself when will the Commission come to the Vaal Triangle so that we can come and tell the truth.  All that happened in the past has passed.  I am thankful to the Lord that I am still alive.  I am used to this kind of life.  There was a course that I had to attend in Pretoria and they demanded R4 000, because of lack of finance I couldn't - I want to work, I want to live a normal life like any other human being.  I don't want to sit at home doing nothing.",
