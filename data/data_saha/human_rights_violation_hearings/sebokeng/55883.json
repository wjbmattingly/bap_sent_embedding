I summoned my daughter and I asked as to how he could sleep beside the street and I sent them to go and look.  I followed them thereafter.  When we went there to look he was already removed and taken to the hospital and a police van came and they said to us we must go and fight for ourselves.  But I did not understand what they meant because I did not know what they were referring to.  Then from there we went to the hospital and when we got to the hospital we found that he had been dead on arrival and he was taken to the\nHRV/800 mortuary/...\n2\nmortuary.  On the following day we went to the mortuary at the hospital.  When we got there we found the place full and they said we must go to the court.  We got him at the police station mortuary.  And we took him to Kambula's Mortuary and I had decided that I was going to bury my son all by myself.  We received a report that we could not bury my son alone. They had to be buried as a group, as they had died together. The Kambula family was very sympathetic because I never paid for the mortuary expenses.  They were buried together.",
