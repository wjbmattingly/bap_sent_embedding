I was together with my three other friends as well as my two children, my two sons.  As we were watching TV they told me that they wanted to go and sleep because they were tired.  I took them into the bedroom to sleep.  As we were still watching TV I decided to go into the main bedroom and my friend had gone to the toilet.  After about a while we heard somebody forcing the door open and the door got open.  Some of them had actually closed their faces, they were also wearing handgloves.  They said they wanted money.

I had been shot also.  And I woke up from the ground and I tried to listen as to whether they were still in the house.

            "Anna thank you for sharing that with us.  Anna we have listened to your pain, to your anger, and to your suffering still.  To have lost two children within one night, and when we look back on that part of our history we can all say why. It seems so senseless.  And I am going to ask our people from the Reparation Committee because your pain is still so obvious and we need to be able to give you some help now.  So hopefully our briefers today will speak to you after this as well and something can be done to start that healing process.\n You so rightly said that 19 people died on that night, on the eve of Chris Hani's funeral when the nation was mourning already.  And many people have said that if there was a moment in our history where our country was going to burn that was the moment that it was going to happen.  And yet the discipline of our people came through.  The resilience of our people came through.  But again we ask ourselves what manner of people are these that when we were \nHRV/818 mourning/...\n9\nmourning already that they go and compound our pain and suffering by making many other people mourn too.  And I think we need to reflect and ask ourselves that question and certainly those people who were responsible for that need to clearly ask themselves that question.  I thank you for coming.",
