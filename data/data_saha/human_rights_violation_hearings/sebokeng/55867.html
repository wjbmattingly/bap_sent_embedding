<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>DR BORAINE:   Good morning Mr Ntsoereng and also to your </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>daughter we are very glad that you have somebody from your </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>own family who is with you and I hope that you are going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>feel relaxed.  It's not easy to sit where you are.  You are </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>the first today and that's even more difficult because the </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>day is still young and it hasn't really started, but you </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>will start by telling your own story.  I want you to know </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>that this is not a court of law.  We are not here to </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>interrogate you.  We want to help you to tell your story.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>Now I'd like you to start with the 3rd of September 1984 </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>where there was a meeting at the administration offices to </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>talk about electricity and then to take us through your </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>story and I will try not to interrupt unless there is some </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>question that I might want to ask.  Will you start now </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   There was a meeting, the meeting was with </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>regard to electricity.  It was three weeks before the 3rd of </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>September.  The meeting was held at Zone 13.  As the </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>residents of Zone 13 we were actually their representatives </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>and Zone 13 was behind with their payments and it was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>first one to pay R8,50 when other locations were still </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>paying a relatively low fee.  When we got to the Council </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>they explained to us that it was difficult for Zone 13 to </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>obtain electricity if they did not increase the money that </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>we had to pay and we were behind in arrears.  The residents </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>accepted this explanation.  At this meeting it was myself, </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>HRV/1046 Mrs Musala/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>2</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>Mrs Musala as well as Mrs Dhlamini when we explained to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>residents and the residents accepted the explanation.  Can I </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>go on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>DR BORAINE:   Yes please do go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   When the residents accepted this that was on </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>the first day, it was on a Saturday, people from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>administration offices in Sebokeng came with a fire </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>extinguisher.  When they brought this fire extinguisher it </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>was a very surprising story, though I had already heard that </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>there was going to be a rent boycott, now I wondered as to </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>what was the fire extinguisher going to do.  It so happened </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>that on that day, from that day up to Monday it was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>third day, but it was on a Monday at about 9 o'clock there </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>was some violence within the community.  After that violence </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>had started I realised that there could be some problems </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>arising because the shops were burnt.  That is when I </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>decided to move away from my place and I went to my </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>brother's place.  This went on and on up till the afternoon. </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a> At that point when I was listening to the radio I realised </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>that some of my members had already died on that very same </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>day, and we realised that the situation was quite volatile </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>and I could not go out of the residence.  Up till sunset </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>even the following day then on a Wednesday it was between 5 </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>o'clock and 7 o'clock my house was burnt down.  As my house </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>was burning I really discovered that it was now quite bad </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>but I slept there and friends who were with me at that day </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>tried to help me get out of that place and they tried to </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>help me as I am a widower.  They took me from there and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>took me to the Administration Board at Houtkop. I related </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>this matter to the police and asked them to go and fetch my </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>sons who were left there as well as their sister.  When I </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>HRV/1046 got/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>3</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>got there the policeman went to fetch my sons and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>brought them to Houtkop.  I will try to explain this a </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>little bit further.  As I'd already explained that we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>sent a certain matter and there was a fire extinguisher my </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>co-members they were not only fire extinguishers but they </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>also got guns.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a> I'll just explain it a little bit further so that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>may be clear that we were a different organisation.  There </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>was a Mathlasedi organisation.  There was also an LPP as </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>well as Bafutsane.  I was a member of Bafutsane </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>organisation.  This really surprised me to get that some </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>others were armed and we were not armed.  Probably they knew </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>what was going to happen thereafter.  We remained there.  As </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>we were still there we had to hold certain meetings to try </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>and get some solutions and resolutions to the situation.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a> As we were still furthering this matter there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>another aspect that was troubling us within the community.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>That was the issue of the liquor outlets.  We, as the people </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>that we could be able to go on as a community and develop </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>ourselves.  I hope it is clear that at that time the liquor </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>licences cost a lot of money to obtain because the bottle </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>stores outside were not allowed to bring liquor into our </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>location, and we realised that that was the only thing that </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>could help us out of this predicament.  As we were taking </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>this matter further we realised that we could not see eye-</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>to-eye with the administration board because the </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>administration board and the council was already there at </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>that time.  They told us that it was a matter for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>administration board and they wanted to privatise the liquor </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>boards.  It is true that was the end of the matter, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>these were separated in a surprising matter because most of </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>HRV/1046 them/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>4</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>them, that is the greater part went to the other people.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>That is another matter that troubled the community.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>stayed as the situation went on.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a> Now as we went to the meetings we kept on having those </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>meetings and we started having altercations and we were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>seeing eye-to-eye with the other organisations that I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>already explained, and they started moving out of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>organisations and crossing floors to other organisations.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>Some of them were being helped by the administration board. </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a> And it so happened that as time went on we discovered that </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>as we were staying at DC Group we had to move away because </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>we did not have houses anymore.  And at the time when we </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>decided to move we had to get another place to stay where we </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>were going to build and we got the space at Zone 10.  I can </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>still point it now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a> We discovered that we did not have anything, any </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>possessions, because all our possessions had been burnt when </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>our houses were burned, and it so happened that at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>juncture I can say that most of the people who were there </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>got money which could be to the amount of R5 000 in order to </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>start our living.  I, and Mr Musala was one of the people </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>who did not get any money.  It happened that at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>particular time I saw another fire extinguisher and it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>still there at my place.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a> It happened that those houses were rebuilt and when </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>these houses were built there had to be a division and I got </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>a unit next to the hostel.  All the other ones from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>other opposing group had to go to other houses at Zone 10.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>They went to stay there and this place was surrounded by a </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>fence.  There were certain policemen who were guarding that </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>place 24 hours of the day.  I was given the third fire </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>HRV/1046 extinguisher/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>5</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>extinguisher.  When I got out the fire extinguisher was </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>there, there was no fence, nothing.  And when I enquired </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>about this issue I was told that the person who was issuing </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>the R5 000 rent money was the Commissioner.  When I went to </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>see him at his offices he said I should wait for the State </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>President's Fund, there is no money that I will ever get.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>It so happened that the next year if I am not mistaken, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>was in June, the State President's Fund arrived.  I wasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>living peacefully and I decided to go and rebuild my house </p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>in the township.  It happened that thereafter the houses </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>that belonged to the councillors, the houses that were in </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>the townships were now fenced.  Now at the hostel unit where </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>I was staying there was nothing.  I nearly forgot that my </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>friend Mr Musala who was with me in this trouble decided to </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>leave Vaal Triangle to go to Pretoria.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a> It happened then that when they were busy fencing the </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>houses the then town secretary Mr Scholtz he was involved in </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>this scandal, he was taking money for himself and there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>a court case and he was sentenced.  If I remember well he </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>also made an appeal, I don't know whether he succeeded with </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>the appeal or not.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a> This is the trouble that I have been through.  All this </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>started in 1984 until in 1987 because you will understand </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>that I was between two trouble areas.  In the township I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>being chased by the people and on this other side I was also </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>being chased away.  There were bursaries afforded children, </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>but my children couldn't get even a cent from those </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>bursaries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a> I want to say to you today my community harassed me </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>because we negotiated with them at first before I could get </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>into the council and the administration and the council </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>HRV/1046 itself/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>6</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>itself was harassing me.  Now you have to understand, a </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>father who has got children, what kind of life was a man </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>supposed to live in those years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>DR BORAINE:   Thank you Mr Ntsoereng.  You have described </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>very clearly what it was like in that period 1984 and </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>onwards.  Now you mention that you were a councillor but </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>your weren't a member of the LPP, you weren't a member of </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>the ruling party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   I wasn't in the ruling party Sir, I was in </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>the Bafutsane Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>DR BORAINE:   And that was an opposition party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   Yes it was the opposition party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>DR BORAINE:   But the community were opposed to councillors </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>whether they were in the ruling party or in the opposition </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>party, is that right? Shall I repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   Yes you can repeat that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>DR BORAINE:   I was saying the community were they opposed </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>to the ruling party and to the opposition party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   I didn't know of any opposition from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>community because I've already explained that we had </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>regions.  Now in the region where I was the same region paid </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>my fees to register because we were paying R250,00 as </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>registration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>DR BORAINE:   Could I ask you then why do you think your </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>house was burnt down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   I think I have explained that on the 3rd </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>people were killed and on the 4th, on the 5th my house was </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>then burned, and I realised that the community was now angry </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>and they decided to do the same thing even if they chose me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>DR BORAINE:   So there was a very big argument about who </p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>should represent the community and who shouldn't.  Now you </p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>HRV/1046 mentioned/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>7</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>mentioned that some of the councillors, probably only from </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>the ruling party were given R5 000.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   Yes I have already explained that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>DR BORAINE:   But you weren't given that because you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>not the ruling party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   The people who did not receive the money was </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>myself and Mr Musala, we were the leaders of the other two </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>organisations.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>DR BORAINE:   Now you mentioned that the State President </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>Fund in 1985 paid out some of the councillors for the loss </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>of their houses, were you paid as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   The State President's Fund paid everybody </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>because a cheque was directed to a specific person.  That is </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>the money that I have already explained that I used it to </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>rebuild my house, that was then destroyed again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>DR BORAINE:   How much was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   It was R16 000.  That is why I managed to </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>rebuild my house.  Sir I will explain that it was my house </p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>that I built myself, it wasn't the Municipal house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>DR BORAINE:   But then you mentioned very briefly that your </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>house was destroyed again in about 1989 or 1990, now why was </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   Sir, I won't tell you, I don't know the </p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>reasons because I was not a councillor anymore, but as I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>not feeling well I was not here in the Vaal Triangle.  There </p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>were people staying in my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>DR BORAINE:   Now the house that you are staying in now, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>that another house that you had to build or rent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   I had to go to the Unit, I went back to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>Unit that I was given before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>DR BORAINE:   And are you employed or unemployed at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>HRV/1046 moment?/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>8</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   I am unemployed Sir.  I am not working at </p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>this present moment.  I am just selling oranges and fruits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>DR BORAINE:   Do any of your family live with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   Yes Sir, this is my daughter, one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>DR BORAINE:   You live together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>DR BORAINE:   Do you receive any kind of pension at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   I am not yet at the right age to get a </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>pension.  I have a request Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>DR BORAINE:   Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   My request is that the files of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>administration board have to be taken out and our council </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>files have to be taken out as well so as to get the clear </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>message that we are in this situation because of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>administration board.  You will realise that the money that </p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>the people were paying were only helping the south part of </p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>the Free State, with the money from the Vaal area.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>Wittsieshoek area was built through the monies paid by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>people of this community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>DR BORAINE:   We have noted your request.  Is there anything </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>else that you want to say to the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   I don't have so many things to say Sir.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>That was the request.  Now my other request is I am in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>kind of situation what can the Commission offer me so that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>can be accepted by the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>DR BORAINE:   I think that one of the good and the positive </p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>things about these hearings is that it gives people an </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>opportunity to tell their story and explain why they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>doing one thing and not another, and hopefully that as one </p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>tells one's story so the community will begin to forgive and </p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>HRV/1046 to/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>9</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>to forget and to allow people to come back and to live </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>normal lives.  But that of course is up to you and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>community, and certainly it would be a real request from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>Commission that people start healing one another and </p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>receiving one another because those times in the eighties </p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>were times of war and we must now make peace.  Thank you </p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>very much for coming.  I am going to hand back to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>Chairperson in case anyone else wants to ask you questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Dr Boraine.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>MRS SEROKE:   Mr Ntsoereng I just want to ask you to briefly </p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>explain to us why were the people boycotting rents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   As I have already explained people boycotted </p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>the rent because of many reasons.  You will understand that </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>in the year that we were placed in power it was the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>year of the Tricameral Parliament and the Black community </p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>was not happy at all about that Tricameral Parliament, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>was the first reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a> The second reason I can say the privatisation of liquor </p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>outlets was another issue that dissatisfied the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a> The third thing we have to remember that when Sebokeng </p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>was formed Sebokeng was really expensive.  I still remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>people were paying R8,50 rents and Sharpeville was only </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>paying R3,50 a month, and Sharpeville was using the bucket </p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>system at that time.  They didn't have a sewerage system.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>Now it so happened that when the townships were put together </p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>people in Sebokeng they discovered that Sharpeville was </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>actually developed through their expense and they were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>satisfied.  And I have to say, we have to remember that even </p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>before our council came to power there was a community </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>council and this council increased the rents two or three </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>times a year, and they said after a few months we will add </p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>HRV/1046 a/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>10</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>a certain amount and after so many months we will add </p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>another amount and people were not satisfied at all.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>think those are the reasons why the people were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>satisfied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>MS SEROKE:   Now as a member of Bafutsane were you fighting </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>for such things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   Remember I was from Zone 13 which was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>first zone with no electricity.  It suffered a lot.  We must </p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>remember the administration board also started in Zone 13, </p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>they were staying in those houses.  Now the development of </p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>Sebokeng comes from the area called Zone 13. That was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>area paying the highest rents.  All the zones are coming </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>from this other zone.  That is why I emphasise that </p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>investigations should be made as to what happened to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>monies, as to what happened to the money because we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>made to understand that Sharpeville was helped actually by </p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>the monies from Sebokeng.  We have to understand how the </p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>(...indistinct) developed through our monies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>MS SEROKE:  I thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Dr Randera has a few questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>DR RANDERA:   Mr Ntsoereng I just want to understand that </p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>period a little better, what were you doing before you </p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>became a councillor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   I was a salesman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>DR RANDERA:  And you said earlier on when you were speaking </p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>to Dr Boraine you said "my community harassed me but we </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>asked for their permission before we became councillors", </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>can you just tell us a little more what you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   When I say the community harassed me, my </p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>house was burnt and I had to leave the township, and that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>the same community that trusted me at that time. </p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>HRV/1046 DR RANDERA/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>11</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>DR RANDERA:   I know it's a long time ago, can you please </p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>just tell us there were, I understand there were some </p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>elections for these local councils how many people actually </p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>voted for those councils, what percentage of the population </p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>in your opinion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   I can't remember the percentages but what I </p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>can remember is the fact that in our region we had a LPP </p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>member and I had 1,400 votes and he only had 600 votes.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>am talking about the region here, not about the Vaal </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>Triangle in general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>DR RANDERA:  I just want to come back to where you started </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>your statement, I mean maybe the dates are right, maybe the </p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>dates are wrong, you say on the 3rd of September you had a </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>meeting in Zone 13 with, or three weeks, sorry my apologies, </p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>three weeks prior to the 3rd of September you had a meeting </p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>with the people of Zone 13 ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>DR RANDERA:   It sounded like it was quite a reasonable </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>meeting and then three weeks later you say on the 3rd of </p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>September I heard over the radio that some of our </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>councillors have been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>DR RANDERA:   What happened in this period?  On the one side </p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>you seem to have had quite a reasonable discussion with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>people of Zone 13 and three weeks later it seemed like the </p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>township was burning, what happened inbetween?  Who was </p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>responsible?  Who were the other organisations that were </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>working in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   Which area are you referring to Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>DR RANDERA:   I am talking about your area, Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   I want to point out that there were many </p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>HRV/1046 organisations/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>12</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>organisations.  UDF was present and they also held their </p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>meetings and we used to hold our meetings as well.  Now the </p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>meeting we held three weeks before we were about to report </p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>to the community that we will not meet their demands if they </p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>don't agree to the fact that the rent has to be increased by </p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>R5,00.  In that same meeting, it was a great meeting, a big </p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>meeting because we had the drum majorette, there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>beautiful day, we were explaining to the community this </p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>issue of increment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>DR RANDERA:   Mr Ntsoereng I just want to come back to this </p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>issuing of guns to the councillors, who gave out the guns?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>Was it the administration or the police who gave out the </p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>guns and were people trained to use those guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   I want to talk about the training, I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>know whether they were trained to use the guns, but what I </p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>can explain is that those guns were the adminstration bought </p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>guns.  That is the fact I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>DR RANDERA:   My last question Mr Ntsoereng.  You say in </p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>your statement,</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a> "These people who destroyed my house they also </p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>destroyed me morally.  I put the blame to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>regime, that is apartheid".</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>Now I want you please to just tell us what you mean by that, </p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>but also in doing so can you please tell us in your memory </p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>how many councillors actually lost their lives during this </p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   Nobody in those years wanted oppression.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>Myself as a councillor I didn't like oppression but the </p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>regime put us in trouble.  I have already explained that </p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>investigations should be conducted because the Black people </p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>were used by the Government.  The community of the Vaal </p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>HRV/1046 Triangle/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>13</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>Triangle was living on conditions of bridging finance.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>used to meet their target and they could also meet their </p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>target at Wittsieshoek.  I have already indicated that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>irrigation system in that area was supported through the </p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>funds of our region.  And the community lost temper and </p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>patience. That is why I say the regime is responsible.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>know the deceased Mr Kuzwayo Dhlamini who was killed.  Mr </p>

<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>Dhlamini was killed in Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>DR RANDERA:   So that is four people that you know who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>killed during that time who were councillors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>MR NTSOERENG:   But the people who died in that violent era </p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>were many, not only the councillors, but many people died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>DR RANDERA:   Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Ntsoereng on behalf of the TRC I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>like to thank you so much that you came.  Thank you that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>brought your daughter with you today and introduced her to </p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>us.  We really want to say to you that the Truth Commission </p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>has many tasks.  One of the tasks is to try and find out the </p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>truth of what's happened in South Africa and the information </p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>you gave us will help us piece together the true story of </p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>everything that happened in the Vaal Triangle in those </p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>difficult years.  Thank you for helping us with that.  And </p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>we also want to say to you that we do have sympathy with </p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>you, with the dilemma you were in.  You told us about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>difficulty of being a councillor in those years, as you said </p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>you were chased by your own people, on the other hand you </p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>were harassed by the regime, by the administration and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>know that the councillors also suffered and that their </p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>families suffered with them.  Thank you that you told us </p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>that and we do hope that partly because of your story today </p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>HRV/1046 that/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>14</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>that you and your family and many other councillors and </p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>their families will be well accepted back into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>community.  And as for your request that there's </p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>investigation needed about the monies, the way the monies </p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>were used we will take that along and we'll present your </p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>request to the TRC.  But thank you for coming, and thank you </p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>for bringing your daughter.  You may leave and you may take </p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>your place again in the audience.</p>
