            "Chairlady, on the 11th January 1991 my son by the name of Michael Ndlebe and my daughter-in-law, they asked to go to attend the night vigil at Zone 7.  It was\nHRV/875 their/...\n2\ntheir friend who died.  I said yes they could go.  They did leave the whole night.   The following day in the morning on Saturday my daughter-in-law was supposed to go to work and we were surprised they were not coming back.  We were sort of surprised what was happening but no one could relieve us.  As the day went on, I think it was around eight, one man came who was a neighbour to us in Zone 12, by the name of Zwandile.  When this man came he told us that things are bad in Zone 7, people have died.  Blood had been shed.  I got worried because I knew very well that my children were there as well.  My eldest son by the name of Naido and his uncle said to me just sit down and relax, we will leave and find out what is happening.  Indeed they left.  The whole day they never came back.  We were surprised as to what was happening.  When they got back they told us that they were already coming from the hospital.  When they followed they said they arrived there at Zone 7, everyone had already been taken to the hospital.  When they got to the hospital they searched in every ward and they could not find Michael.  The only person they found was the wife.  Michael's wife.  When they asked Michael's wife she was also asking about her husband, Michael.  They went in search of Michael, they went to the mortuary but still they could not find Michael, and they came back.  On the second day, it was on Sunday, they went back again.  They could not find him.  On Monday they went back again, they could not find him.  On Tuesday they did find him in the mortuary.  Here at home the comrades kept coming asking how things were going.  When we tried to explain to them they were of assistance to us.  They helped us about things that we did not have, they supplied us with some things.  They indeed performed a good job bringing food\nHRV/875 and/...\n3\nand all the preparation of the funeral.  We spent the whole week.  On the second week, that is when all those who died were going to be buried and they were asked to go and gather in the stadium of Zone 7, truly we did go there.  After that we went to No. 1 for the funeral, to the cemetery, to the graveyard.  We got back fine.  We arrived at home just fine.  On that very day, at the night of that day, on Sunday evening, police came.  We just heard by the knock at the door.  We found out that they had surrounded the whole house.  We were already sleeping, the lights were off.  We all went to the one bedroom.  The whole family, we were packed in the one bedroom.  They kicked the door.  The door burst open.  We didn't know how they opened the door.  They came in and when they were inside they came direct to the bedroom in which we were.  They said to us we are the police.  First of all it was dark in the house, we didn't have any lights on but they had their torches on.  I asked them who do you want, they said we are looking for Michael Ndlebe.   I told them that we had already buried Michael, I don't know the Michael you are talking about.  And I don't know why you are looking for him and how you are looking for him because the police were present at the stadium.  They said you are lying, Michael is still alive and we are looking for him, we are going to put Michael right here now.  They searched under the bed, they could not find Michael.  They could not find him.  They asked for Michael's death certificate.  I told them we didn't have it.  They said tomorrow you should go get it from the mortuary.  We will be here to fetch it.  Truly we did that, we went to the mortuary to get it but they never came for it, up to this day they haven't come for it. \nHRV/875 PROFESSOR MEIRING/...\n4",

One wonders what manner of people these were, that on the night of a funeral where people are still mourning their dead that they come and harass people even further and it is so important for the work of the Commission that the police must come forward and speak about this themselves.

Now the whole of Sebokeng experienced this, especially the Zone 7 people.  Up to the time where you lost your son.  As Dr Randera has already mentioned, we do feel bad about the fact that when you were still mourning the police came, rude, to harass you, kicking the doors, not feeling sorry for you about what you were going through at the time.  It is really painful that Michael left his wife, young as she is, and their son also died.  You don't even have any grandchild.  We do feel bad for you.  We do trust and hope that, as Dr Randera has already made mention, we do hope that the police also will come forward to explain all these things.  We thank you very much.",
