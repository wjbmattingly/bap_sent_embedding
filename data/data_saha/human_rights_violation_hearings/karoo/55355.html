<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a> Good afternoon Mr Simakadane, can you hear me well?  Will you switch on your microphone please - you press the red button, thank you - please will you stand to take the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>KOOS SIMAKADANE Duly sworn states</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>Thank you very much, advocate Denzil Potgieter will facilitate your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>Thank you Chairperson.  Good afternoon again Mr Simakadane, I hope you are relaxed and well - very good.  Now you will tell us about an experience that you had at the hands of the comrades in Phillipstown and also concerning your niece who was also attacked by the same group of people in about the middle of October of 1985, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>Good - would you like to tell us what happened.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>I was sitting in front of the door  at about seven o'clock I saw a group of people passing through my house, going down and they came back again passing through my house, others they were in the next street.  I saw others coming from the corner they were chasing a child.  This child came - child came running but I could just hear her crying and I ran there to that house, I asked this people what was happening.  They didn't answer me, they just - they came to me and they beat me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> I tried to defend myself, I found an iron lying down and I defended myself with it and they ran away.  I followed them an my niece followed me, I went back to my house.   My brother-in-law was sleeping and I woke him up, I told my niece to sit down, but she didn't want to sit down, she went to her sister's house crying and my brother-in-law followed her.  I also followed them to that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a> When I arrived there, I saw her that she was bleeding in the head, my brother - my brother-in-law was bleeding in the head and I told him to go back home.  And I tried -I tried to talk to him and this group of people came to me and they beat me, I lost my [indistinct].  They said that we were informers and they told us to come out because comrades were passing by and there was a confusion at that time, there was a mix-up between the Council and the people in the township.  The Council was helping these people to kill other people and I lost my teeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a> I opened a case against these people but it didn't continue, I just heard that the case disappeared and I didn't under understand </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>that because we injured, we came from the hospital and I had three wounds in the head, but I didn't understand why this case can  be just - can just be disappeared.  I just want to know what am I suppose to do with this thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a> I will answer this question by myself, but I would like an advise what am I suppose to do, because my case was - had just disappeared without my concern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>

<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>

<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>They were chasing a child - it was about seven at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>And do you know the child who was being chased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>No I didn't see this child, I just saw them breaking my nieces windows and furniture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>So then next thing happened, that happened was that they - this group went into the house where your niece was.</p>

<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>Yes a big comrade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>So if I understand your evidence correctly you then went to the assistance you went to help your niece who was being attacked by this group of De Klerk people?</p>

<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>And you were also attacked in that process when you were trying to stop the attack on your niece, they turned on you and they  attacked you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>Yes they attacked me and I tried to defend myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>Were you injured in that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>Yes I was injured.   I have three holes in the head and the - my teeth.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>[Question inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>They attack me with sticks</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>And your niece was she injured in that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>No she was not injured but her father was injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>So was the father also in the house when these people came in there and broke the house up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>Yes he was sleeping at my house and I left him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>[indistinct] at what stage did this group attack your niece's father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>He woke up and he followed us and he got injured at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>Did you received medical treatment for your end of Tape 3, Side A ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>why do you think this  group attacked you?   Was it simply because you tried to intervene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>I think the reason was because this - one of this children they were destroying the shop of one of the Councillors, that's why they were chased by these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>So the - this boy that they were chasing was responsible for doing damage to the shop of one of the Councillors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>I am not sure, because I was not there, but I just heard that these children were destroyed, they destroyed the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>But these - these people the two that you've named, did you have any argument with them or was there any bad feelings between you and them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>No I just went there to stop them because they were beating my niece and I just asked them what was happening and they beat me, we didn't have any quarrel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>So the - the only reason why they attacked you, was because you were trying to stop them from attacking your niece.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>Yes that's the only reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>You say that you laid a charge against them - with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>Yes I laid a charge and we went to the Magistrate but the case just disappeared. </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>And nothing happened to them at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>To - no nothing happened to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>Do you know why that, why that is so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>This is the reason I am here - I want to know what happened - many of the Councillors we have and many of them are members of the ANC now - and I want the Commission to find out from the Magistrate what happened on that case - how can he just leave the case and not consult me, that is very difficult for me to understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>We have noted that, I can perhaps mention to you at this stage that our own investigators looked into the case to try and find out what was going on and they have been to the police station in Phillipstown, but they could not find any record of the case that you have laid with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a> So unfortunately up to this stage we haven't yet been able to locate the records about - in connection with the case that you have laid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>I think you can find this person he is in Bloemfontein - his name is Bothma - he is not overseas -he is in Bloemfontein.  He can tell you about this dockets, I think he is the one who destroyed the dockets, his name is Bothma.  He is a Magistrate, he was here before.  He must come here and tell where the dockets are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>He was a Magistrate where in which place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>Here in Phillipstown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>Mr Simakadane is there anything else that you would like to bring to our attention, anything else that you want to add to what you have already said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>MR SIMAKADANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>No there is nothing, I am full.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>I am glad to hear that you have cleared your heart,  you have spoken your heart, that's what we are here for, thank you very much.</p>
