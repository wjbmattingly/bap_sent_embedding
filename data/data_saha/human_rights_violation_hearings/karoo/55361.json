The police said - asked them if they are telling the truth.  My mother is very cheeky - she insisted that she works in Victoria West.  From time and time again, they would come.  \nShe then phone the house where my father was staying.  She told my father that there are police kept on coming.  My father is originally from Lesotho.  When my mother phoned, somebody said he was jailed.  She asked the boers - the boers were cheeky - my mother is also cheeky.  The boers said my father had left because he is too political.\nMy mother never was clear whether my father had gone home to Lesotho, did they take him to the border gates, what exactly happened.",
