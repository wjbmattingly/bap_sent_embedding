Happened also roughly at about the same time and that is why we've got you both together, but we will start with you Mr Maseti.  \n Thank you very much.  I am going to move to Mr Mfazwe and we listen to his testimony before I hand back to the Chairperson.

I used to answer and tell them that they mustn't ask me that because they've got the constitution.  They would show me document with the executive members of NOYCO.  They asked me if I was an executive member.  I said yes.  They said that there are two constitutions of NOYCO.  They do not have the correct one.  I asked them whether this - which on was the correct one as they thought.  They would not reply.  They would take me to the police station and torture me.  Take me home and take me back again.\n  Sometimes they would detain me for two weeks.  I would go through the same process.  If  I would not know what they requested, they would torture me.",

You have given us a very strong picture of the way in which in those years the authority figures of the time felt that they could do anything.  That the state of emergency gave them powers to detain people without trials, hold them in solitary confinement, to subject them to physical torture.  \nAnd one of the things that we hope to do towards creating the kind of society in which that can never happen again.  Community organisation like NOYCO was seen as centres of resistance that must be stamped out at any cost and I think that it's important for us to remember that in every little town, those struggles of the people in organisations like NOYCO and others that were affiliated to the UDF and to other political organisation - other view points even - were all part of the contribution that brought about eventually in this decade the first democratic elections and the new government that we have.  \nSo what you suffered was not for nothing.  It was part of the struggle to build the new society.  But we also now that you paid a heavy price - that although you say that you are reasonably well now, that experience does create an emotional impact on you and you have to rebuild your lives.  \nWe wish you well in doing that  and we hope that Mr Maseti you will be able to find employment because it's all very well to talk about the new democracy, but until that translates into development for the small country areas as well as for the cities and jobs and better futures for the people, we won't really be very far along the road to transformation.\nBut we thank you for the things that you did to help towards that process and for coming today to talk to us and to tell us what it was like to be young in Noupoort in 1985 and 1986.
