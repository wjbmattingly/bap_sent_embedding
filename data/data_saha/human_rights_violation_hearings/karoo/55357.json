The second house from my home, that  is where I was going.  When I was coming back I got shot by the police,  I then fell,   I got unconscious.   \nWhen I regained consciousness,  I was in Bloemfontein.  I stayed in the hospital for four months.  The fifth month I had to be taken back to Kimberley.  From Kimberley to De Aar.   When they shot me they thought they were shooting my cousin's brother,  because they were looking for him.  His name is Monde Makhadula.  \nWhen I got home, he fetched me -  I did not know why the police fetched me.  They took me to a Court of Law.  They said they found me guilty of having burnt down a clinic.  I told them I do not know anything about this.  The court case lasted a few days.  I did not have an attorney. \nThe witness I had was not called to the stage.  That witness was my mother.  She was mentally disturbed.  When I asked them  - when I asked them if my witness could talk, they just gave me a five year suspended sentence.  I wanted to know why I was found guilty, but I was not told.  I still do not know who has shot me.  I want to know who shot me.\nI was just a laughing matter.  People were just laughing at me.  At school I cannot participate as much as I would like to.  I fail all the time.  I repeat every standard five times.\nCould the Truth Commission please find those people, because they have destroyed me.  That is all I have to say.",
