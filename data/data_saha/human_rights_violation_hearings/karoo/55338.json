            "In September 1985 my wife bought meat from Try Meat.  After she bought that meat, Thabo Gusha grabbed the meat from her.  After that there was never happiness at my home.  \nAlways the community was toi-toiing against us, saying that we are informers.  They would throw stones at our house, saying that we are going to be burnt down.  Circumstances continued in that light until one Saturday, my elder brother Joseph Dilato, came to me at home.  My wife was sweeping outside.  Sipetho Asiya, Joseph came inside.  He asked for beer.  I said there's no beer.  He then left.  \nThen I heard my wife crying.  I ran outside to check why my wife was crying.  When I looked Sipetho was running after her, chasing her.  He had a six litre petrol gallon.  Nobody said anything to anyone.  They just threw stones at my house.  My windows were broken down.  We retaliated, but no-one was injured that day, because the police quickly came.  The perpetrators then ran away and there was quite.  \nAfter about three or four days, I do not remember clearly, my wife was going to work.  She usually would leave earlier than me.  She  used a taxi.  My wife left me at home, going to work.  Unfortunately that day, that taxi would not let her get in.  She was left behind.  She then walked.  People accosted her.  They burnt her.  \nNow as I was going to work, a few children accosted me, saying that my wife is being burnt.  I also was going to be burnt.  I then ran.  I tried to get a car to take me to the police station, so that my wife could be protected and saved.  When I got to the tar road, I got a car driven by a white man from Escom.  This car drove me to the police station.  When I got there I was told that a police van had fetched my wife and took her to the hospital.  \nWhen I got to the hospital, I was told that my wife was going to be transferred to Bloemfontein.  They asked if I would go with, I said yes and then we went.  On the way my wife said to me, these children have injured my badly.  It is Tifo Setlaba who has burnt me,  Pingjan Kelem, Tabho Gusha.  She did not say more.  I stayed with her in hospital until I had to come back to Colesberg.  \nI got on a van to go home to find out what has happened to my children.  When I got home, there was no house.  It was burned down.  I went back the police station.  I stayed there.  I had no place to sleep.  Because when they toi-toied, they said that the informers must move to other informers.  \nAs a result of that I went to stay in a house in town.  No-one would speak to me, because if anybody had spoken to me, they would also be in trouble.  I had no friend, I had no sister, I was on my own.  No-one came to see me.  I stayed there terrible life.  If I went to talk to anyone, I had to go to the police station and chat to people there and then I would go back and sleep.  After a while on the third, I phone Pilenomie hospital where my wife was.  I wanted to find out what state she was in.  The nurse that I spoke to said that my wife's condition is improving.  I must not worry. \n When I was preparing to go visit my wife in Bloemfontein, I got a phone call.  Actually a telegram, telling me that my wife has passed away.  I went to Bloemfontein.  \nWhat was difficult for me is that before I went to Bloemfontein, I would get reports that I cannot bury my wife in Colesberg.  If I do so, the would take the corpse and burn it.  I went to my wife's employer.  I told him that I want to bury my wife.  Won't you please give me permission to bury her in your farm.  He refused, because he said his farm would be burned, his tractors would be burned.  \nMy wife then had to be buried in Bloemfontein.  I had to stay under the terrible conditions of being a father of three children who have no mother.  My wife used to help me, but she cannot.  That is all I have to say.",
