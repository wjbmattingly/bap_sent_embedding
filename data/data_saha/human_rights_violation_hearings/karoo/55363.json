            "I was arrested in the morning - his name was Snyman, Thomas and Smith.  These were the policemen that arrested me - China as well.  China is the one who pointed me out and  identified me as Madoda.  They took me in the morning.  They put me in a police van.  They drove me to the police station.  \nWhen I got to the police station, they had taken other people with as well.  When we got to the police station, it was still  in the morning, we sat there.  Our parents came the same day to this police station to ascertain what happened.  They were told that they could not see us.  At about seven -  eight the same day,  Snyman and Thomas came and opened my cell.  \nThey took me into a van yet again.  I was asking myself where am I going in the evening.  I thought they were taking me to a place where they were going to take a statement.  The place was familiar, the building had two floors.  We went to the upper floor.  Thomas then said to me today I am going to tell the truth.  They said I must tell the truth, I had burned down those buildings.  You know exactly what's going on.  I said I do not know.  I was not there.  They said you are going to tell the truth today.\nI don't know where Snyman emanated from, he had a sack he put it over my head.  I could not even move, because there were quite a few policemen there.  He put it on me, after he put it on  he took my hands behind my back, tied them.  After he tied my hands, he threw me on the floor.  I was told to lie on my back and look upwards, my legs were pushed up.\nThere is a cane that was put under me.  This cane, they put some stuff in my body as well.  My body  was just going funny in a very painful way, with sounds, I was crying and  crying.  Then they switched off whatever it is they were using.  They said I must tell the truth.  I burnt down the structures,  I said it was not me.  \nThey started again, they switched on whatever it is that they were using.   It was very painful, my strength evaded me.  They stopped again - they asked yet again.  I denied, again they started.  And eventually I just admitted.  They then said that they would stopped and they stopped.  \nThey put me in another office from that office.  Every man that came there into that office,  right through the night, just came to give me a beating.  It was all  boers.  I wanted to fight back, but I could not, because there was quite a few of them.  I don't know where they were coming from but everyone who came into that office, boxed me around, beating me up.  I really wanted to fight back, but when I looked, there were too many of them.  I don't know whether they got tired of beating me up.\nEventually they said I must go make a statement.  They took me into a cell,  I slept.  I told the other comrades, the accused, exactly what happened to me.  \nMy friend was taken and the same was done to him the following day.  I was sleeping during the day.  Our parents came, but they were - were not allowed to see us.  At about eight - nine in the evening, this policeman came again to fetch me from the cell.  They put me in a van.  There was no ventilation. I asked myself what type of a van is this.  I had never seen one before.  We drove away from De Aar, we stopped somewhere.  I don't know exactly where we were.\nI heard a sound - they took a huge box out of the car.  It was just me and the van.  Somehow my head was being slapped back and fro.  I was dizzy.  There was tear gas everything -  I was falling all over.  There was no ventilation.  There is nothing I could break - it was just iron everywhere.  I was going up and down at the back of the van.  I was bereft of strength.  \nThey opened the van eventually and I just fell on the road.  Snyman kicked me.  He said I am going to tell the truth.  I was dizzy.  I was just crying, asking what have I done, they would not tell me.  They carried on until they were tired and they put me back into the van. They drove back - back to my cell.  \nOn the Saturday, we were sitting, all the comrades - we were singing.  A  policeman, Ngonmo Nbeni, walked past us.  He went into a van, he took something that's about  1/2  meter long.  He took it into the cell, it was tear gas.  There was confusion and chaos in the cell.  We did not know what to do.\nOur parents were told not to come that day.  They were told that they could not see us.  We took our heads and put them in the toilet, because all we wanted was air, we wanted to breath.  We were fighting over the toilet.\nAt night they took us and threw us outside - that is the only time we got some air.  After we breathed sufficiently, they took us back into the cell.  \nMy life has never been the same.  I was sentenced twelve years in prison.  After I was sentenced I was mentally disturbed.  Now and again I get disturbed.  Even now -  I served my term and I was released when the other political prisoner were released.  This was after six months in jail.",

It's clear that they still have - that experience still has an effect on you.  And we really hope that something can be done to help you not to feel so troubled in your heart and mind.  You are very fortunate to have work, and work that you like.  We hear so many people who are not able to find work and who are therefore extra suffering, so you are - you are really blessed in having an employer who understands some of your difficulties.  \nYou mentioned also that there was a friend with you who had the same treatment.  Do you know whether he has come to make a statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission?",

He'll come to the Truth Commission -  give evidence -  give his report -  meanwhile in the audience -  one of his employers is there.  And that would put him in danger - he might lose his job.\nSo he does not want to give evidence.  He does not want come here.  He says that the guilty people, the perpetrators of  violence were left behind in the location, but it is innocent ones that went into prison, that were tortured - he refused to come.",

            "Thank you for telling us that.  We are aware that people are sometimes afraid or reluctant for other reasons to come and testify.  So that's another reason that we are grateful to have heard from you.  \nWe hope that during this process that this Commission is doing it's work, we can begin to establish the kind of relationships, where people will not be afraid to come and speak the truth.  Because we can't carry forward the same kind of problems that we had in the past.  We have to build a society where people can be honest and can speak without fear  and that is one of the things that this Commission will be working towards, but we need the co-operation of many people to achieve that.  \nMs Dwyali, thank you too for coming today.  These experiences have an effect on families and everybody suffers when a son or a husband or a brother or a wife experiences this.  So we hope that things will be better for you in the future and we thank you very much for coming today.",
