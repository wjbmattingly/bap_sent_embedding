<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>SOLANI GCANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>It was on the 3 July.  It was in the morning.  We were toi-toiing.  We were toi-toiing from the Apostolic church.  While we were still toi-toiing, there is another church, the Methodist church.  We left we were a group of people and we left the toi-toi at that time. </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>I was on my way home at that time and I met my friends on my way home.  We stayed on the way with my friends, but not in the main road where people were toi-toiing in the other street.  While we were still in that street, police came with a Casspir  and they came to watch us.  They had binoculars with them.  They came to the place where we were staying.  As we see the Casspir was approaching us, we decided to go to one of the nearest houses, Ms Lutolo's house.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>The police stopped the Casspir near this house.  The other police went in the back door and the others came through the front door.  They found me inside the house.  They didn't say anything.  They didn't ask anything from us.  The first policeman names Jansen touched my shoulder and he dragged out of the house in the front door and he kicked me and there was  a policeman waiting for me outside the house.  They beat me with their guns, their rifles, they kicked me and they took me to Casspir.  They put me inside the Casspir.  The Casspir has got two seats inside and their is a passage in the middle.  I was told to lie down flat on that passage between the seats.  They kicked me severally at that time.  They stamped me, they  stamped on me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>And all this time they were kicking me, they placed me on top of the Casspir with a sjambok around my neck and around my waist.  They were beating me all this time.  They told me to toi-toi, because I was toi-toiing.  They told me to say Viva and I did all that.  They were assaulting me all this time with their sjamboks.  All this time this police were beating me and they moved they drove the Casspir to town and I saw two police vans, a brown and a yellow one.  They transferred me from the Casspir to the van.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>While I was in the van I think they arrested me at about eleven to twelve p.m.  Before one o'clock the police came back and Chris was one of the police who was there.  He was a detective here in Colesberg, initially he is from Aliwal North.  He accused me of burning his car.  He came to me with one litre Coca Cola.  He opened and entered inside the van.  That litre of Coca Cola was empty.  He knocked me with that empty bottle on my left eye severely. The one white policeman came and he dragged him out of the van trying to stop him from beating me.  The Hippo was following the van and they took me to the police station with the van.  [Indistinct]    </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>I was taken out of the van and they were beating me and assaulting me all the time.  I was taken to the charge office.  Chris came from the Casspir and he took me to the back. Through the back door of the police station.  He took me to shower in the police station.  What they did to me in the charge office, Chris opened the shower, the tap of the shower, together with Jansen.  Chris had a cane and Jansen had a sjambok in their hands.  Chris put me under the shower and accused me of burning his car.  He was asking me why I burned down his car.  I couldn't answer him at that time.  I was crying all the time.  They didn't stop.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>When they finished with beating me, the took me to another room.  In that room there many policemen waiting for me there.  The first policeman showed me tied my hands and there was one policeman with an axe handle.  All of those policemen who were in that room, they assaulted me several times with this axe handle.  They gave each other a chance to beat me.  They didn't stop.  They put a sack in my face. And they twisted my private parts.  I couldn't see at that time because the sack was in my face.  They at this time my face was still covered with the sack.  They didn't stop there.  There is a drawer in that room and they took my private parts and put them inside the shelves and close it hard.  And they then took me outside and then they took me inside again to do the same thing to me again.  That was not all they did to me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>They took me to another room, the third room.  When I got in that third room, they were boers in that room, the white men.  They assaulted me. They were beating me up.  They were doing all this dirty work to me.  I was taken out of that room, it was late.  At about midnight they took me to the garage.  When I got in the garage there was a van in that police garage.  They took me to the van.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>In all this time, I was naked all this time.  They took off my clothes.  They took me to van and they told me to lie there.  When I look inside this van, there was blood all over the van.  I couldn't sleep in that van, because I was so scared.  I saw blood all over the van.  I stayed there for ten minutes and they took me out of the van.  I think it was about six to eight boers who came to take me out.  There were also black policemen who were there.  They had R1 rifles with them.  They took me out of the van to the gate.  They told me to run.  I refused to run away.  I refused to run away.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>They took me inside again.  They were beating me and assaulting me all this time and I was naked.  They took me to the front door of the police station.  It was during the time at that time at about two.  My attorney phoned them and told them they must release me and that was when I was released and I went back home.  Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>Firstly we there were some issued we demanded from the police and we told them that if they didn't answer us on the second, we will protest.  So that's why we were toi-toiing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>You say they took you to the Casspir.  They hung you from the top.  What do you think the reason was for them to do this.  What did they want to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>SOLANI GCANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>When they did this to me they wanted to kill, because they knew that what they did to me was a bad thing.  Everybody who saw this didn't like it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>MS SEROKE</p>

<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>You say Chris when he was assaulting you, he accused you of burning his car.  Did you do that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>When they were assaulting me, I was alone in the van, but when I got to the charge office, there was another guy who was there and I think people of Colesberg did not know that there was another man who was arrested.</p>

<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>When you got better did you lay any charges against Chris and Jansen, the policemen who were assaulting you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>SOLANI GCANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>When we came from the doctor, my family decided to make a claim.  The police heard that we were laying a charge against them.  And what they did, they charged me with public violence.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>Were you arrested because they laid a charge against you for public violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>SOLANI GCANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>I couldn't continue with my claim, because when my parents were laying this charge, I was the one who was charged and it was the policeman's charge which continued.</p>

<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>SOLANI GCANGA</p>

<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>What is wrong with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>Patrick was ill from  very early age, but now he is mentally disturbed.  He is mentally disturbed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>We understand ma'am.  Could you tell us according to your perspective Patrick's condition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>In July 1985 at two o'clock I was knocking off from work.  I was told that Patrick was taken by Casspir.  The following morning I went to the police station to ask the police not to beat Patrick, because Patrick is not well.  It was locked at the police station.   No-one opened the door for me.  I was asked to knock at the back door.  I knocked until the opened.  There was a white policeman there.  I asked where Patrick was.  They said they have never heard  of him.  I said you took Patrick in a Casspir.  I banged on the counter.  I said my child is here with the police.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>Patrick then leapt from amongst the police.  They had hidden him in the most atrocious way.  Patrick then fell. I asked why are you hiding Patrick.  What has he done.  Why are you treating him like this.  Why would he leap only when I banged the counter.  This man then said he does not know what Patrick has done.  I should go and ask the police in the Casspir.  I went back to the township.  I accosted the Casspir.  I asked the police in the Casspir what police has done.  What Patrick had done.  I said Patrick is not well, he is not healthy.  Please give him back to me.  They refused.  They said is they would find Patrick in the streets, they would shoot him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>Please just tell us clearly.  Had they put Patrick in a locker or what.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>No, Patrick was between the wall and the locker.  There was a small space between the wall and the locker.  He was all curled up.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>Do you think they were trying to hide Patrick from you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>Yes, they were.  They did not want me to know that Patrick is present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>Please go on ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>I then accosted these police in the Casspir.  They refused.  I told them Patrick is not very healthy, therefore they should not beat him.  They said they would look well after Patrick.  But when they went to drink their tea, the would assault him, asking him questions that he does not know anything about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>Throughout the night they assaulted Patrick.  By the time Patrick got to me, at about twelve, Patrick had marks on his body, a blue eye.  I asked Patrick what happened.  Patrick said he was going to his friends and when he was close to the Roman Catholic church, a Casspir accosted him.  They shot him with a rubber bullet.  They then assaulted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>They threw him into a Casspir, driving him to the police station, assaulting him the whole time.  They were asking him everything, things that he did not know anything about.  They threw him in a van full of blood, splashing him with water.  They assaulted even him groin area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>There was Chris Lebane next to the van.  They assaulted Patrick saying that Patrick is their enemy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>Was Patrick at school at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>Yes, Patrick was at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>Was he a member of the youth congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>I don't think so, because Patrick was quite young.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>How old was he then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>He was fifteen.  He was in standard two.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>He was in standard two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>Yes, he was.  After they assaulted Patrick, they took him out of the van that was full of blood.  They detained him.  The next day they told him could go home.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>Did you try to take Patrick to the doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>When he got home, I was too scared to take him to the doctor, because I thought if he is out in the streets, then they would re-arrest him.  I thought a van would be waiting for him somewhere to re-arrest him</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>Thank you ma'am.  I want to question Solani.  This van that was full of blood.  Where was this blood from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>SOLANI GCANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>This was people's blood.  People that was shot in the township.  Because as they had put us in the van, they had told me that I was going to sleep in the van, because this blood belongs to dogs, your dogs, we have shot them in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>Were they trying to scare you, saying that this blood belongs to people, people that had been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>SOLANI GCANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>They were not scaring us, they were giving us facts, because this had happened.  I was not there when this happened, but they were telling me facts that they had shot people in the township.</p>

<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>[Indistinct] had said that when you were at the police station, you saw Patrick sitting next to you at the police station.  Is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>I met Patrick at the police station. That is so.</p>

<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>Yes, I would meet with Patrick now and again.  What they did to Patrick, they had done to me too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>ADV POTGIETERNow you say you met him now and then.  Did you see any assaults being perpetrated on him or did you see injuries on his body or did he tell you about assaults.  What happened?</p>

<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>We were beaten together,  assaulted together.</p>

<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>Can I just ask you to move the mike to Ms Gcanga.  Just one issue ma'am.  You said that you were afraid to take Patrick for medical treatment, because if you do that the next thing that happens is that the police come and pick up or pick the person up again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>Yes, it is so.  I was very scared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>That was what was going on at that stage.  If you go to a doctor for treatment, you come outside, there is a police van waiting for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>That was the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>As if there was some co-operation between the doctors and the police, because it appears as if the doctor or the doctor's staff would notify the police if somebody comes for treatment who was injured in a political situation.  Would that be a fair summary of the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>Well, it might have been so, because that's what would happen.</p>

<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>Martha, you said Patrick was not healthy, even from an early age.  What then happened after all this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>His health deteriorated.  He is mentally disturbed to this day.  He does not work.  He does not do anything.  He's just in the township.  Sometimes he does not even know who he is.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>Have you tried to get him a disability grant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>I thought of that and I tried to get it. </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>Is he on this disability grant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>Yes, he is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>MS SEROKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>In your statement what you not said now, you have not mentioned, you said that you accosted the Casspir and made them stop.  I appreciate that, because it is only a mother's love that could bring about, evoke such determination.  Thank you for that ma'am.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>I just want to ask one question of Mr Gcanga please if you could pass the microphone again.  Mr Gcanga I just want to make quite sure that our papers are all correct here.  In the written statement that was typed after you made it, it says that you are currently staying at number 12 Phatsha street and then it said Knysna. Is it Knysna or is it Kuyasa or Kayasa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>SOLANI GCANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>No, I stay in Colesberg, not in Knysna.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>[Indistinct] of Colesberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>SOLANI GCANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>In Knysna.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>No, no is there a township in Colesberg, what is the township where you stay, was the are where you stay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>SOLANI GCANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>Kuyasa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>[Indistinct] was reading Kuyasa.  They read Knysna and typed Knysna by mistake in the statement.  So I am just going to correct it.  So it will say number 12 Phatsha street, Kuyasa.  O.K., thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>SOLANI GCANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>Yes ma'am it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>Yes, I did correct that.  Thank you very much.  I would just like to say to all of you thank you very much for coming today.  Two young men who had a really terrible experience which has affected your lives right through until now and we hope that from now on things will be better for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>That it will have helped you a little bit to talk about your experiences, but we also realise that you need help, that you need to be able to find work or in the case of Patrick to be able to obtain a disability grant and we will see what can be done to help to point you in the right direction.  We really are grateful for you for coming today and we just want to ask if there is anything that you want to say finally before you leave.  Mr Gcanga you want to add anything.  Ms Mlawuli you want to say anything else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>MARTHA MLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>I have nothing else to say.  Thank you very much indeed then.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>Mr Gcanga you want to say something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>SOLANI GCANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>Yes, I have something to say.  Can I talk now?  I request of the Truth Commission please investigate.  I want to know the perpetrators.  Again I will request the Truth Commission.  My parents have spent a lot of money on me.  I go to the doctor.  Nobody gives back that money.  Could you help me with my treatment with the doctors?  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>Mr Gcanga, let me explain that what the Commission is able to do is not in fact give out funds to for instance as you say reimburse your parents for their medical expenses with you.  At the end of the procedures, we will write a report which will recommend to the President and the Government steps that should be taken and it would be that some compensation the medical treatment might be one of those steps.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>We don't know at this stage what that will be.  At the same time we also have our reparations and rehabilitation committee which can in some cases intervene to give urgent interim assistance and it is possible to make application for such assistance.  So in the meetings that you will have after this hearing, we will explore opportunities of what can be done. Thank you very much.</p>
