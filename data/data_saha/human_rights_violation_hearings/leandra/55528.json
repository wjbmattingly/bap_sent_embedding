            "In 1985 I was at the store, Inkatha Trading Store.  That was my own store.  As I was there the kids came looking for my sister Ndlong.  I told them that she had just left.  They left, went to my home and that is where they found there.  They brought her with back to the store.  Suddenly I saw people coming to my, to the store and saying I should erase that Inkatha name and I explained to them and said I cannot erase that name, because the owner of the store is actually not around.  They were armed with weapons.  People I saw there was Sipho Bob and Msweni's son by the name of Victor.  He was the one in the forefront leading the group of youth.\n They went away.  At about eight pm they came back and now they were looking for Dan who has since disappeared.  I told them that Dan is not around and they started looted.  They were taking things my store, from the store and I left immediately and went up the roof of the store and that is where I hid.  They did whatever they wanted to in the store and finally I went back home.  When I got there I found out that they were attacking my home and opening the doors looking for Dan.  We ran away to an outskirt place where we were going to seek refuge.  We were seeking refuge in every home nearby.  I took, we left with my husband to Mr Mayisa's place and found that Mr Mayisa was not around and went on  to look for Kabinda and also we found out that Mr Kabinda left as well, ran away at night.  He was sailing in the same boat as we were.  \n On Monday we tried to drive to Delmas and the police stopped us and told my husband to get out the car and the other man as well and they were assaulted.  I do not think they were aware that at the time I was expectant, because they also assaulted me.  After that the other man said how could you possibly do that to this highly expectant lady and they were taken to the police station.  We were all taken to the police station.  When we got there they refused me to have a look and talk to my husband and I went to Mr Mayisa's place and Mr Mayisa promised to call an attorney by the name of Priscilla Jana.  He did his best to get hold of the attorney and we went to the police station.  When we got there I found that he was brutally assaulted in an inexplicable way and myself I was feeling so much pains and so much in pain.  \n I went back home and went to see the doctor as well.  At home whilst I was there these very people came armed.  They demanded that we open every door of the house and there was my mother-in-law and they pointed an assegai at her and she fainted right away, she collapsed.  Till to date she has a speech defect and Dan disappeared since the incident.  We do not know his whereabouts and each time we try to enquire from the police they do not come out to the surface with the truth.  I am so sad about Dan's story, because only if we knew where Dan was perhaps we will be at peace.",

            "Thank you Joyce Seroke.  Ma Masilitso Ndlovu, I would like to thank you very much for coming.  I think that you have told us a terrible story, terrible for what it shows.  You were and it is a story that we hear again and again, but every time we hear it it still has the same impact, because it is the story of ordinary people being thrown into dangerous situations for reasons completely beyond themselves and without reason.  Secondly, you are now still missing and have been for more than ten years missing a family member.  This too is not helped by the rumours and it is very difficult to stop those sort of rumours.  I think that you have shown great courage in coming and in bringing your story to the Commission.  As the panel has said we will try and see what we can do to follow that up, but in the meantime we would like to thank you very much for coming, for showing that courage and showing us your strength in telling that story.  Thank you very much.",
