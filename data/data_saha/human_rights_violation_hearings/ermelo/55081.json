The conflict between, on the one side the Black Cats and then the other side, the Comrades and you were caught up in that conflict yourself.  I'd like you to just tell us your experience and what happened to you.",

            "It was on the 28th of July, on Sunday at Umzulu Street.  There was a conflict.  One of the leaders of the Black Cats was shot.  In that confusion one of my brothers who wasn't there went to the scene where there was shooting and one of the leaders of Black Cats was shot.  He tried to help Zwee by taking the watch from his wrist and he was going to report to the Black Cats that he has been shot.  One person by the name of Boblina came to our house to tell us that Zwee has been shot and he's dead.  Thereafter they went to tell the Black Cats and the Black Cats came to our house to investigate the matter to find out what happened to Zwee.  The Black Cat thought Zwee had been betrayed by Bob.  They tried to ask us a lot of questions but we didn't know anything.  The following Monday they came to tell us that it's possible they might come back to attack us.  On that Monday they never came back to attack us.\n On the 30th of July, it was on Tuesday, we were sitting at home with the family and we were discussing family matters.  It was in the evening.  While sitting there the deceased, Bob's mother heard a knock at the door, the front door.  When she went to investigate she could see that this might be the people.  She tried to ask them as to who they were.  One of them answered saying he's Themba.  It was so confusing and we just kept quiet.  They started kicking the door.  I wasn't sure whether they shot at the door or whether they hacked with a panga.  As we used to call the deceased Kohli and we asked, why do you have to close the door.  While we were still there two people entered the house.  One of them was wearing  a balaclava and he shot, he pointed at the deceased with a firearm and they asked where Bob was and we told them Bob was not at home.  They took us and put us into the deceased room.  They were taking the mother throughout all the rooms trying to search for Bob and we really told them that we didn't know where Bob was.  Therefore they continued their rounds, searching the house with Bob's mother.  She tried to lead them or bribe them and she called someone by the name of Kanage.  As she was a Shabeen Queen she tried to persuade them not to do what they wanted to do.  She tried to give them some money.  They took the money and everything and  (indistinct)  it together.  They switched off the lights in the room where we were.  They took Bob's mother to the kitchen and when they arrived at the kitchen they shot her.  It was so late and dark.  \n They ran away and they were shooting as they were running away.  We didn't see when the grenade was thrown at us because it was dark.  As I was running away from that incident, as I was trying to run I happened to step on top of the grenade.  It exploded.  I discovered waking up lying on the bed and I was oozing blood.  I couldn't walk and I was confused.  The people were also confused.  They even offered to go and see what happened to Bob's mother.  I asked them to go and find out how she was.  They also tried to attack the front room but they failed.  Most of the people ran away and I was left alone because I couldn't walk.  \n Later when I talked to my Mom, I called her and told her, it looks like I'm going to die.  I asked her to take me to my place.  Just to take me to my home and I crawled.  When I arrived at my grandma's place, I felt that I was going to die on the road.  Therefore I crawled next to one neighbour.  The neighbour took me into the house and I asked the neighbour to try the next neighbour, to ask the neighbour next door to take me to hospital.  She said she's afraid because there was fighting outside.  She couldn't.  They tried to go and make  a call.  They called for an ambulance.  After that I couldn't remember what happened because I've got some problem in remembering things.  I've have some pains on my feet and all my trousers were torn and I thought I'm going to be cripple at that time.  They took me on an ambulance to hospital.  I stayed in hospital for about two months.  I would say that the Black Cats working in collaboration with the police, searched for Bob and they found him together with my brother.  They were suspecting there were people who knew exactly what happened on Zwee.  I don't know as to how the trial lasted but they went to court and they ended up winning the case and that's where it ends.",

That is something that is both very terrifying and at the same time must somehow give you strength because you survived an attack which could have killed you.  You were in a situation, in this conflict between, for instance between The Cats and The Comrades.  You were in a position where you could have died.  Is that not so ?  Others died around you and you have survived that which must be a great source of relief on the one hand but also of strength.  So I think what we would, in thanking you for coming and in thanking you also as you say, you've come  forward to make sure the people know what happened and to see whether we can help.  We can help but perhaps I think  the more important thing is that you can help yourself and what we would urge you to do is to start doing that because people will look up to you.  You're still a very young person.  You have talents you need to develop those talents.  You need also to seek help from the community, to ask how you can develop it.  Certainly we will investigate the possibility that there might be for you but we'd like, in thanking you I'd like to say, you know, use the strength that you have, that you have shown  in coming forward and having survived that attack.  Thank you very much for coming.",
