When he came back he spent one year and eight months and then he left for a funeral at Mdeni, a funeral of a friend. Now on his way to the funeral he took Dr Asfat's car, but when he came back from the funeral, Dr Asfat's car was full of other people and he wanted to run with other comrades. But two men called him, they said come and ride with us.  Then they\nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 M MAFA\ndrove together. Now at the bridge, the King Molatsane and the Cladi location, comrades were staying in there.  They started pulling him out of the car.  Now that man said he is a spy and he said take him, he thinks he is clever because he comes from Robben Island.  They started throwing my son with stones and they stabbed him. \n This car proceeded to the funeral.  They washed their hands and they ate, they enjoyed themselves, forgetting about this other person.  As they were eating, his friends asked where is Martin, and they said no, he is around the people here, he is eating.  Martin on the other side was being assaulted by people, they were stabbing him, until in Cladi where he fell next to a church.  They finished him off there.  They took big stones, they crushed his head and they necklaced him.\n Now this boy, the thing that puzzles me, this boy has never had any clash with Martin and he had never been involved in a fight with Martin. In other words they are just, he was fighting for the words Robben Island, Martin has been to Robben Island, he left him here. I don't understand why would he kill a person just for the fact that he had been to Robben Island.  That will be the end of my story.",

I think one of the hard lessons we are going to have to learn in South Africa, is that if we don't share the same poitical views, it does not mean that we have to be enemies.  So many people's lives have been lost in this country, because even amongst ourselves we have fought with each other. We grieve for you in your loss and we hope that we will be able to assist you, with understanding why all of this happened.  Thank you very much for coming to tell us this story.  Thank you, Mamma.\nAPPLAUSE\nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG",
