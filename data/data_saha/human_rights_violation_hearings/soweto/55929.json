We therefore left the school premises.  We got home. There was some noise in Potchefstroom Road. We therefore left with my friends to go and look around at what was happening, but we never got to arrive exactly where there was confusion.  As we were still standing a hippo police car came by.  When it came people were already running around, running away and they sprayed teargas.  Just when I thought of taking another step, running away I was shot and I fell down.  As I was lying down there there were no people around me.  People had already run away.  I could not even stand up.  When I got to SOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 A MOLAPO\nthe hospital I could not walk and the soldiers were not allowing us to go through the hospital gates.  There were some soldiers accompanying me.  When I got to the hospital they told me that my mum had passed away. The people who saw me getting shot they left away to tell my mum that I was shot and my mum died immediately.  As I was at the hospital I had difficulty with my spinal cord and they operated on me at my spine.  They inserted iron.\n As I was still at the hospital there was a soldier right next to my bed.  I was under his mercy by so speaking.  There were on shifts.  I was discharged and I was taken to Nelspruit at the school of the disabled.",
