<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a> .... which is one use on my left-hand side. I was swollen here on my right-hand side. I was dragged on the ground, hit against the concrete wall.  That's all I could remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Was it for the first time that you personally came into conflict with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKHEMISA:</span> No, it was not the first time.  The other time it was during the march and the march was illegal and the police stormed in and I managed to escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Can you remember any of the names of the police that you know who directly assaulted yuo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKHEMISA:</span> Unfortunately not, because there were White policemen, but what I could say is that the person who was in charge of the whole situation was Sgt Nkosi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Do you know where is he based now, that Sgt Nkosi, in which police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKHEMISA:</span> Yes, ma'am, it is in Carletonville police station.</p>

<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKHEMISA:</span> Yes.  Ma'am, I tried hard to go to school and I managed to finish my matric.  So presently I am unemployed and every time I go looking for a job - I have been turned down because of my first impression.  So I can't make a living, it really hurts.  And I did perform well at school always.  My mental position is no longer stable.  So if I could at least establish how weak is my mind, I can be very grateful. Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> If yuo say you are often turned down because of your first impression, can you just explain briefly to us what is it that make people turn down immediately when they see you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKHEMISA:</span> I think maybe that is the scar I am carrying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> You also referred to a mental position, mental state which you suppose is no longer stable.  What do you do which makes you doubt your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Sorry.  Could we ask that people remain quiet, these hearings are for the purpose of victims and to allow them to tell their stories.  So could we please have respect for the witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKHEMISA:</span> Thank you. I am having a problem with my recall system and my recording capacity in my mind. I can't recall properly.  When I concentrate I can't concentrate properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Tell me, how do you link that up with what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKHEMISA:</span> Ma'am, when I was beaten I lose my consciousness and especially this injury I obtained on my right-hand side, it appeared to be an internal injury and I can still some pain right now.</p>

The request that you have made are in fact very simple ones.  You have asked that you want to know what your state of mind actually is.  The Commission has taken note of that.  We are sad that you are not able to find employment because of the scar on your face. We also take note of the fact that you are still undergoing a considerable amount of trauma, and we hope that we will be able to assist you in that regard.  Thank you very much for coming to share your story with us.</p>
