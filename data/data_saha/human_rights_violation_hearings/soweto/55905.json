There were not many people who were involved in the African National Congress at the time, and your name was quite a legend for me when I was growing up.

            "Thank you very much.  First of all I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my deep appreciation for affording me the opportunity to testify before this Commission.  Thank you very much.\n I really don't know where to start and I have only got half-an-hour.  So I suppose the amount of time that is allocated to me will only be about 15 minutes, 20 minutes or so.  But I will try to recap as much as possible.\n First of all I would like to say that I became politically involved after the arrest of Comrade Kathradu and 155 leaders of the Congress alliance.  That was in 1956.  As a result of their arrest I became increasingly involved with the work of the Transvaal Indian Congress and all the Congress alliance.  In 1959 I joined the South African Communist Party and up to today I still remain a member of that organisation. \n Now in March 1960 - I am just going to go through a little bit of background so we put the whole thing in the proper context.  In March 1960 I think it was, after the Sharpeville massacres, the African National Congress and the PAC were actually banned.  \n As a result of the banning the African National Congress was confronted with very critical decisions.  Those decisions were the most important decisions.  All the African National Congress, in its entire history, the \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 L CHIBA\nbanning meant that the African National Congress had to submit or to fight.    The African National Congress took the historical decision to continue fighting for the liberation of our people.\n The second decision it had to take flowed from the message of struggle.  Ever since its formation in 1912, the African National Congress have conducted a peaceful and non-violent struggle.  Now that it had been banned it was confronted with what to do.  Do they extend the non-violent struggle to the armed struggle.  After the intense debate within the ranks of the African National Congress, and of the Congress Alliance, the decision was taken to launch the armed struggle.\n I wish to stress that these two historic decisions on the part of the African National Congress were decisions that have led our country to where it is today. \n After its banning the military wing of the African National Congress, Umkhonto weSizwe was launched on the 16th of April 1961.

            "December. Oh, I said April by mistake. My apologies. It was on the 16th of December 1961 that Umkhonto weSizwe was launched and Comrade Nelson Mandela was our commander-in-chief.  I was amongst the initial group of cadres, MK cadres, who was of course involved in the subsequent campaign of sabotage.\n Now I think it is important to say something about our units.  Each sabotage unit consisted of four members, with a unit leader, and four such units constituted a platoon.\nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 L CHIBA\n I think it was by mid-1960 that I was made a platoon commander, heading for such sabotage units. We were actually based in Johannesburg, and our area of operations were Vrededorp, Newtown, Fordsburg, Newclaire, Firetown.  Those were the areas of our operations.\n I also want to state that in carrying out our activities we were under very, very strict instructions.  The first instruction was that during the course of our activities, sabotage activities we had to ensure that no loss of life occurred, civilian or otherwise.  If there was a danger that there would be such a loss, our strict instructions were to suspend or postponed the planned act of sabotage.\n The second instruction that we had to adhere to strictly, was that under no circumstances were we to carry any sort of arms whatsoever.  That means when we carried out an act of sabotage and there was a danger of us being arrested, we were not even in a position to defend ourselves.\n The third instruction was that once an act of sabotage had been carried out, we were under strict instructions not to revisit that site.  So those were the three instructions that our units actually had to adhere to.",

            "Actually there were two categories of targets.  The one category of targets was the question of power lines, telephone wires, substations, transformers, signal boxes.  Targeting this kind of targets actually meant that the normal type of services were disrupted.  But there was a second more important type of targets, and these targets\nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 L CHIBA\nwere institutions and symbols of apartheid: pass offices, Bantu Commissioner's offices, magistrate's courts, and so on.  These were the types of targets that we actually bombed, blew up.\n From there I think I will go on to what had actually happened.  On the 17th of April 1963, five of us were arrested. Comradie Viji Vania was a unit leader and he and his unit actually planned an act of sabotage on Railway property.  Unfortunately his unit had been infiltrated by a police agent by the name of Gamat Jardien. Obviously of course he had informed his superiors about the planned act and not unknowing to Comradie Viji Vadia and his members, unit members, the place of - the site actually had been surrounded by police and they were immediately arrested.  \n As far as as Gamat Jardien was concerned, not to expose that he was a police agent, the special branch actually arranged it in such a way that he actually managed to escape.",

            "The date actually was the 17th of April 1963, that was the date of the arrest.  Those who were arrested were Comradie Viji Vania, Abdulay - not Abdulay, Inglis Naidoo, Serius Nanabay, that were members of his unit.  They were arrested at the actual site of the planned act of sabotage.  The other two that were arrested were Abdulay Jassat and myself.  We were arrested at three am in the morning.  We were arrested at home actually.  Their arrest\nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 L CHIBA\nactually led to our arrest subsequently.\n So on the 17th of April we were taken to Marshall Square.  There, of course, I found Comradie Viji Vadia. I must say that I was shocked at the state he was in.  He had been very badly assaulted.  His ribs had been smashed.  His shoulder had been broken.  His face was badly bruised.   Inglis Naidoo, he had been shot at the site in his upper chest.  So that was the condition. From what I could gather, at that point in time, he had received no medical treatment whatsoever.\n We were kept at Marshall Square the whole day and only the following morning we were actually taken to railway headquarters, because the planned act of sabotage had actually taken place on railway property.  \n We were all placed in a room and we were then called in by one by one for questioning.  Viji - Nanabaya was called first. He came back.  Inglis was called, then Viji and then Abdulay Jassat and I was called in last for questioning, just towards early evening.\n When I entered the room I found approximately eight or nine White males, amongst them were Maj Brits from the Railway Police. There was Lieut Van Wyk from the special branch.  There was Rooi Koos Swanepoel, also from the special branch, and as soon as I entered, those three actually left.  So there were about five or six people who were actually present in the room.\n They started assaulting me, punched me, kicked me and in the process my face was badly bruised.  My left ear-drum had been punctured.  They wanted to know who my contact was in MK.  They wanted to know the next link in the chain of command.  I pleaded ignorance. I told them that I didn't know anything. I told them that actually there must be some \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n7 L CHIBA\nsort of a serious mistake that they were making on their part.  \n The assault must have lasted half-an-hour or so. It is very, very difficult for me to assess the passage of time under these circumstances.  But what was to follow was far more serious than the assault that had taken place.\n From behind someone threw a sack, a wet hessian sack over my body so that half my body was covered and I was partially strait-jacketed. I was then flung onto the floor.  My shoes and socks were removed and I could feel electric wires being tied to my toes, to my fingers, my knuckles and so on.  \n They wanted to know who my contact was.  To them that was a very crucial issue.  I pleaded ignorance.  I told them that I did not know.  Every time I resisted answering the questions, they turned on the dynamo and of course, violent electric shocks started passing through my body.  They did so every time I refused to answer.  All I could do was to scream out in pain.  I could only scream and scream and plead ignorance.\n Again, it is very difficult for me how this entire process, how long this entire process lasted.  But I must say that it could have gone on for an hour and a half or even maybe two hours.  \n After the electric torture was over, I was unable to walk, I collapsed.  They then carried me out.  They bundled me into a car, where my other comrades were, and we were then all taken back to Marshall Square.\n At this point in time I think it is necessary for me to say that I was rather pleased with myself at the fact that I had not divulged any information whatsoever.  I feel proud SOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n8 L CHIBA\nof that fact.  To deny the enemy the information that they so dearly wanted, was something that I felt good about.\n At the same time ...

            "No, they are quite okay, I'm sorry, they are quite okay.\n I think time is passing, I think I will move rather quickly now.\n We were then brought to the magistrate.  We were charged with sabotage.  Our trials were separated. Comrade Viji Vania, Iglis and Abdulla Jassat actually were - their trial was separated from ours because they had been arrested on site.  They were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.\n Abdulla Jassat and I were then detained; charges were withdrawn against us. We were detained under the 90 day detention law, which had just come into effect.  We were\nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n9 L CHIBA\nplaced in Marshall Square in solitary confinement.  \n At the time of - when the time came for my release, a date in August, I was approached by Lieut Van Wyk who said that they were prepared to release me, they wouldn't re-extend my detention, on condition that I did not lay charges against the police for having tortured me when I was arrested. I had to take a decision on the spot. I decided that I would agree to that condition, but upon release I would refer the matter to my organisation for guidance.\n When I was released I referred the matter to my organisation and my organisation instructed me to lay charges against the Police, which I did, through one of my comrades, a relative who was an attorney.\n Now after I was released, immediately after I was released, a few days later, the great escape had taken place, in which Arthur Goldreich, Harold Wolpe, Abdullah Jassat and Mosi Moola had escaped from Marshall Square.   As a result of that escape, I was once again asked to go underground and I was underground for a period of about three months.  \n As you know, by this time, I think it is in July, that the Rivonia arrests had taken place.  On the 11th of July, Comrade Kathradu just reminds me of that, on the 11th of July, Rivonia arrests had taken place, and the national high command had been smashed.   There was only one survivor, and that was Comrade Wilton Mkwai whom the police were looking for very desperately.\n It was during this period when I was underground that Comrade Wilton Mkwai approached me.  The national high command had to be reconstituted.  I was asked to serve on that body and I served on the second national high command \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n10 L CHIBA\nuntil my second arrest in July 1964.\n We carried out various acts of sabotage.  We carried on the campaign.  Of course only at this time we were now directing the campaign on a national scale.  I think it was in July 1964 that while I was once again arrested.  \n Among others who were arrested at this stage, were Babela Saloojee, Paul Joseph, Mac Maharaj, Steve Naidoo and Amien Kadji.\n I was arrested at home. I think it was on a Monday morning and the person who arrested me was Maj Brits from the Railway Police.  I tried to escape from the back but was unsuccessful, because the back was also blocked off. I was taken to Greys Building, on the 6th or 7th floor.\n I entered the room. I found, amongst others, Lieut Van Wyk and Rooi Koos Swanepoel.  I was assured that unlike the previous time they won't even lay a finger on me.  What they did was, they took a foolscap sheet of paper, A4 size, they put it on the floor and they asked me to stand on that. They said that I was not allowed to move off from that sheet of paper.  \n I tried to work out what their strategy was.  Previously when I was arrested they had assaulted me very badly.  They had tortured me with electric shocks and they had - I did not answer any questions.  This time the idea was that I should be kept standing for many, many hours without sleep.  I stood there from about nine o'clock on Monday morning until Wednesday early in the evening, late in the afternoon.  That was a period of approximately 58 to 60 hours without sleep. \n Fortunately, once again, I did not answer any questions.  But what they really wanted to know, was where \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n11 L CHIBA\nwas Wilton Mkwai.  Comrade Wilton Mkwai who was on the first national high command.  They wanted him very badly.\n I was then booked in at the Langlaagte police station under the 90 day detention law.  That period was once again extended, during which period Comrade Wilton Mkwai had been arrested and we were then transferred to Pretoria Central in Pretoria Central Prison.  \n It was here that I had heard that Comrade Babela Salooji had been killed. ... (Pause) ...\n Anyway, we were charged.  We appeared in the Rand Supreme Court, five of us, Comrade Wilton Mkwai accused No 1, Dave Kitching accused No 2, myself accused No 3, John Matthews accused No 4 and Comrade Mac Maharaj - currently the Minister of Transport - accused No 5.\n The trial was described as little Rivonia.  We were found guilty of sabotage.  We were found guilty on various counts of sabotage.   Actually 58 counts of sabotage and we were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.\n Comrade Wilton Mkwai was sent to life imprisonment, Dave to 20 years, myself 18 years, John Matthews 15 years and Comrade Mac Maharaj to 12 years.\n We were taken to the local prison and from there Comrade Mac Maharaj and myself were taken to Robben Island.  I served my sentence, my 18 years sentence on Robben Island.\n I was released in December 1982.   I have been involved ... (END OF TAPE 1 - SIDE A).\n ... I was once again detained during the state of emergency.  I was in detention for seven and a half months, during which time I must stress that I was neither tortured nor assaulted.  I came out in 1986 - there was a twilight period between the two states of emergency and the \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n12 L CHIBA\nleadership of the United Democratic Front, who instructed me once again to go underground. I went underground and emerged in January 1987 to try to lead a normal life.\n That actually is my brief story.  Thank you very much.",

But SOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n17 L CHIBA\nfor myself, personally, I really do not want the Commission to do anything for me. I got politically involved in the knowledge that the battle was going to be a tough one, it is going to be a hard, long struggle with many sacrifices along the way.  I did so on the understanding that there would be no reward, no remuneration, no recognition. It is on this basis that I don't want the Commission to do anything for me personally.\n But having said that, I think I must stress that the Commission has a very important function to do, to ensure that the perpetrators who carried out so many acts of torture, who are guilty of murdering, killing our people, are actually brough to justice.  I think that it is the responsibility of the Truth Commission to ensure that they are brought to justice.  But when I say they are brought to justice, I actually mean that their deeds must be known publicly, must be made public.  They must acknowledge that there were gross violations of human rights. They must acknowledge that it was incorrect and they must admit that this was done.  It is only if they do so, can they be forgiven and if only they do so can there be true national reconciliation. I think the Commission has an important role to play in this respect.\n I also want the Commission to correct one or two misperceptions.  We who were arrested and detained, we who were tortured and imprisoned, are often viewed by our people as heroes and heroines.  I think this is understandable, but the real heroes and heroines are our people, are those who remained behind to keep the home fires burning.  The real heroes and heroines of our people are those upon whose shoulders fell the heavy responsibility of ensuring that the SOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n18 L CHIBA\nstruggle continued, and that they had brought the struggle to a successful conclusion.  I think you must give true recognition to that fact. I am sure that the Commission can correct that perception.  That is all that I have to say.",

So we have been struggling with that, in the sense that, how can we assist in policy formulation to make sure that these things never happen again.

When I was actually in Pretoria local prison myself, I was joined by a friend, Fred Phago, who is now unfortunately dead, who told the story about his being in detention. I think it was in Jeppe, die \"strafstasie\", being in detention for two or three weeks in total isolation.  He felt he was going out of his mind.  He said suddenly this person was thrown into a cell next to him.  He never saw the person, he never actually met them, but he learnt his name, because this person taught him through very thick walls - and I think using a shoe brush - taught him the Morse Code, and through teaching him the Morse Code brought him back to sanity, brought him back into himself. In the process of that he learnt that this person's name was Chiba.  Fred would talk for hours about Chiba. I would just like to remind you of that and thank you for that.
