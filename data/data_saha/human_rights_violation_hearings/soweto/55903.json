            "He attended school at Krugersdorp.  The school's name was Sandile.  When he got out of that school I got married and I left for Soweto and I was working.  I brought him as well to Soweto after he had passed his Std 6.  When he had passed his Std 6, coming to join me, he went to Dr Villegas, which is a school. He went to school there and passed his Form 3 and passed his Form 4.  As he was still attending school, the 1976 riots began.  In 1976 I was working but working away from home. So the sister was home with them.\n When the riots began in 1976, I was working at the flats upstairs, that's when I discovered that. I saw so much smoke in Soweto all over and I was wondering as to what was happening.  I asked if I may go home so I may see what is happening. I found out that Soweto was on fire, everything was burning. I spoke to Patrick. I said to Patrick please, your sister is still growing up, please look after your sister, don't be all over the the location with your friends.  Patrick said yes, mom.\n One day when I was still at work, when I was going to get a piece of paper, the newspaper, when I read from the newspaper that he was on the front page, leading the riots. I took this newspaper, I looked at it thoroughly. I was shocked and I was not too sure if this is my son.  I went to my boss. I asked her to take a look at this.  She also said yes, it is your son. I asked may I go back home.\n I asked Patrick, what do you want from these children.  I didn't know what was happening. I said to him what do you want.  He said to me no, mom - right then boers came looking SOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 N BUSANG\nfor him.  They were looking for him. He was running away up to the time when they got him and arrested him.\n When went to his trial he was discharged.  No, he wasn't in prison for long.  When he got out he came back.  He went to Kagiso.  When he went to Kagiso we just heard that the school burnt down.  The school burnt down.\n  He came back home the Wednesday night.  When he got home he slept.  Right then suddenly police came. I said Patrick, here are the police, what have you done now.  He said to me open for them, mom.  I opened for them.  They took him.  He just walked so easily with them.  He left with them. \n He was in prison in Krugersdorp.  When his case was on at No 4, I went there as well.  When the case was on he was discharged, because his uncle was an attorney so he was set free.\n After that I asked him Patrick, what is happening, what are you doing. He said to me mom, please sit down, I want to explain to you as to what is happening.  Patrick sat down and explained to me everything.  Now I got to understand what was happening, because I was in the dark, I didn't know what was going on.  \n After that, boers were often coming to my place, day and night all the time, until they arrested my daughter as well for some book that was in her briefcase in her schoolbag.  That book was Patrick's book and they arrested her.  They took her to Protea.\n When she was at Protea I left with the lady that I was working for. We left for Pretoria to release her and she was set free.  After that the brother was nowhere to be found.  Actually he was in Durban.  The boers came back again, they \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 N BUSANG\nwere 19 in number.  They surrounded the house, looking for him.  He was not around, he was in Durban.  He called me at work just before he came back. I said to Patrick, Patrick, things are bad here, I don't know where to take you now because they came, they came.  He asid no, mom, it is okay, I will see what I will do, but I will come back.  I said don't come home, because when you come home they will arrest you.  \n He arrived and I went to meet him at the station in Johannesburg.  He left for Showela.  He arrived on Friday, in 1979 ...",

That's where he wrote messages like mom, I travelled well, I arrived safely. I was happy, but I was also worried, because we didn't know where he was or where he was going to.\n Aroung 1978, no, I mean, it was in 1987, it was 1987.  He sent someone, a girl. He sent this girl to my home.  When he had sent the girl to let me know that he is still alive.  He said mom, we will make arrangements that you come to Botswana. I said how can I go to Botswana, because this police here said that I should not take any passport, I should not take anything.  Each time I get a call from you I must let them be aware. Then I was confused how can I do this. \n Fortunately there was another girl who was getting married in Botswana. That's how I managed to go to Botswana to meet my son in Botswana.  I arrived and I found him there.  He was so fat, he had gained so much weight.  He had SOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 N BUSANG\ngained so much weight. I said Pat, he said to me mamma, you know what, when I have seen you I am so happy, we are just nearing to coming home, we will be back home soon. I said Pat, we were talking through the night. We did not sleep that night.  We were there, it was in 1979, we were with him until we came back.",

No, I mean to say on the 28th of March when he died, we heard that there is this thing in Botswana; people were being bombed, it was three girls and he was the fourth one in that house, the house they occupied. I had spoken to him on the phone telling him that I will be coming to him on Good Friday during the Easter weekend. He was still alive then.  I said I will come in the next Good Friday, which was in 1988.  The bomb exploded when I was supposed to leave on Friday.\n On the Friday when the bomb exploded I tried to go to Botswana, feeling also that there is something, but I hadn't heard yet that he had died, but still I went. \n When I arrived in Botswana where he used to be he was no longer there.  They used to change places, they would move from one place to another. He was not there.  I had tried to locate him, up until I went to the police station to ask for accommodation. You know I was feeling so uncomfortable, feeling that this bomb, maybe my child was there as well.  But he had a girlfriend that he was in love with and I remember the house.  I said to the policeman when we slept there, they asked me will you locate the house when SOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n6 N BUSANG\nwe take you to the area. I said yes, I will when, when you can help me locate it.  Truly the police took me.  But I never told them why I was there, because I was somehow scared, frightened that they will probably arrest me if I tell them the truth.\n When we got there the police helped me to try and locate the house until we located it.  When we got there we found the people that were not there.  The people were not there, they had left. We were surprised. Now we left.  We went to the neighbour for accommodation.  We asked them to accommodate us.  \n When we slept at the neighbours' place, they came, they arrived, it was on Sunday afternoon.  When these people arrived they said you know ...  You know, they were just lost somehow, because the girl was in love with my son.\n There was a telephone call. The other one was asking why don't you tell her, why don't you tell the woman - that is his mother, why don't you tell the woman that it is her son.  The other one said we must go home, we must go away.  We left with my sister.  We went to sleep in the same house the following day.  We came back home.\n It was on a Tuesday. On the Wednesday we had a telephone message saying that that was Patrick, the one who is dead is Patrick.  It was Mapula who is Patrick's girlfriend, the one who told us that it is Patrick, Patrick has died.  When Mapula was saying that, I dropped the phone.  People heard me screaming.",

We boarded the plane and we flew and when we got at the border, we met the CID already awaiting for us.  When we got off with Ma Jane they asked are you Mrs Busang, the mother of the late Patrick. I said yes. I didn't say, I could not say - I actually said no, I am not the one.  They said no, we are just here to provide security for you, you look alike.  I therefore said yes, I am the one.

I asked myself after a while, why would she say I should not tell the policeman that she is the girlfriend of Patrick. You know, she was looking, she was highly dressed up, so roughly, and yet she is a lady who dresses elegant.  She looked very different and strange, like a person who was in disguise.\n I kept quiet. Mamma Jane was there giving a statement.  The police said this is the Mapula who was in love with this Charles, Patrick.  That's why they called him Charles.
