            "I am Isabella Mbele.  I am here about my child who got lost, so that the Commission might help me find this child.  Because I tried to look for the child, I never found the child.\n When the child left, I may say right from the beginning, the child was arrested, when he had gone along the way, he had been arrested.  They told me that the child was arrested. After the child was arrested in 1977,  he spent so much time in prison and he was released in 1979.  After he was released in 1979, in 1982 he got a job. He worked there.  In 1982 he disappeared, he got lost on September 14th. A certain boy came looking for him at home.   Late in the afternoon when he was coming back from work.  He took off his trousers and put he on old clothes, and he sat outside.  A certain boy came looking for him. I asked him is he not outside.  He said no, he is not outside.  Then the boy said I am going to look for him. This boy is Masai Mpisa.  As he had gone looking for him, when he found him, he did not bring him home.  He left for quite some time and it was late and we slept.  \n The following day, in the morning I woke up and I went to this boy. I asked him where is Andrew, because it is time that he should go to work now. He told me that he didn't know where he was, he had left with some other boys.\n On Thursday when he disappeared, on Tuesday.  Then on Thursday they left and went to the Orlando police station to report this matter.  Yes, I reported the matter and the police refused me to make a statement. I went to see the station commander, telling him that my son has disappeared.  The station commander said to me I shall go down and give a statement as someone who has lost a child. \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 I MBELE\n I went to try and give the statement, but the policeman refused until I left. After I had left I went to Priscilla Jana to report the matter, that I cannot find Andrew and that I had been to the police station to report this matter.  But they did not take my statement.  Priscilla Jana said she was going to write a letter to the station commander to ask him, enquire about this. Yes, Priscilla Jana did write. \n I got, I received the response, that the station commander is there that this boy cannot tell us the whereabouts of Andrew.  I went to the station commander again.  When I got to the station commander, to find out that he had found this boy, but he cannot tell me what kind of information it was.  After a time I told myself I won't go there again.  \n The police came.  This was in 1983.  The police came at night, around one.  When they came they asked where was Andrew.  I told them I don't know. Then they took Andrew's ID, they left with it. \n After that again another group of policemen came, two of them, White policemen.  They had three pictures, photos.  When they got to me, they asked me where is your son here, I did point my son, but they never said a thing, they left.   They came again one day, there were two of them. They still had those three pictures.  When they got to me with those three pictures, they asked me again can you show us your son here. I did. I discovered that my son's face with a black something.  I said but this is the one.  Still, they never made mention of the fact that they have found him or not.  They left.\n After that I never heard one thing.  The police yes, used to come.  The last time the police came to my place,\nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 I MBELE\nwas in 1990, January. They never came again to my home.\n One thing that is so painful is that he had a son. I am left with his son, my grandson now.  I don't even know what to do with the situation.  Even the mother of the son left, but came back. When she came back, she does not take care of the child, and she is working, she is employed here at Protea. She is giving me no help whatsoever. \n Now this is my concern, that please help me to find out if my son is still alive or dead. If I could know that, I can rest in peace.",
