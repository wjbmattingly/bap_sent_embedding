            "Please proceed.\nMR KNIPE READS OUT HIS STATEMENT \nI, the undersigned LEONARD KNIPE do hereby state.\n1. I am a Director in the South African Police Service, I have\nbeen a policeman for 31 years during which period I rose through the rank to my present rank and during which time I have always striven to police objectively without bias and professionalism.  During my period of service, I have always openly advocated equality and non-radicalism, particularly within the Police Force, as it was then known. My advocating of these principles often brought me into conflict with elements within the organisation, which prejudiced me and which one resulted in my being suspended.\n 2. I wish to place on record that I have the utmost respect \nfor the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and especially the Chairman.  I believe that it is imperative that the history of the country, no matter how hurtful it may be, be discovered and made known.  I also believe that it is imperatively necessary that all peoples of our nation make peace with each other.  Because of my beliefs, I will now and in the future strive to assist the Commission to achieve its goals and will answer any questions with openness and candour.  It is for this reason that I am somewhat unhappy at the manner in which I have been summonsed to appear this august body, to provide evidence or to answer questions relating to the tragic death of seven men at Guguletu on the 3rd of March 1986.  I deal with my feelings and unhappiness in paragraph 3 herein below.\n 3.1 At no time was any contact made with me by any \ninvestigators attached to this Commission before a notification in terms of Section 29 to appear before the Human Right Violation Committee, was dropped off at my office on the 12th of November 1996.  In fact the notification for me to appear here today was the very first contact made with me.  No prior interview was accorded me by any investigators of the Commission.\n 3.2 Had I been so contacted I would have related to any \ninvestigator the evidence which I am about to give.  I have in fact related it before in open court, my evidence being subjected to cross-examination on that occasion.  What I am about to say, I would say to anyone at any time without any form of compulsion being exercised upon me to do so.\n 3.3 At no time have I committed any act or omitted to do \nanything which could be remotely constructed as an abuse of power or a violation of human rights.  Indeed, as will appear from what I say, I have to a certain extend suffered because of my principles.\n 3.4 The issuing of a notification on me, without prior \napproach to me, and the immediate thereafter issuing of a press statement, telling the world that I amongst others, was being summonsed to appear before the Human Rights Violation Committee has created the impression that I have in fact, in the past been guilty of human rights abuses.  This has caused hurt to my loved ones, has prejudiced me and has led to false perceptions being created.  I respectfully believe that this action taken while senior members of the Commission were out of the country, has in itself violated my human rights.\n4. As far as the incident in question is concerned, I wish to\nstate unequivocally and without fear of contradiction that I was not part of any planning of any of the actions which led to the tragic deaths of the seven young men.  I did not conspire in any way with any person to take such action, in fact, I had no prior knowledge of the action.\nMy sole involvement was that of an objective police investigator on the scene after the event, and was thus restricted to actions after the shooting on that day only.\n5. In preparation for my appearance before this Commission, \nI have studied a copy of a statement that I submitted during the inquest investigation.  I have read the Inquest Court judgement, although I wish to add that I did not give evidence before the Inquest Court, but only at the trial of Mr Tony Weaver.  I have read a transcript of this evidence given by my during the trial of Mr Weaver.\nI wish to add that it is my sincere opinion that the decision to investigate Weaver was an abuse of power and that such investigation and prosecution should never have taken place.  This belief was one of the reasons which led to me leaving Murder and Robbery Unit and taking an alternative position, which itself resulted in sever financial and personal loss for me.\n6. I arrived at the scene at approximately 745 - 800 on the \n3rd of March 1986.  To the best of my recollection, I and other members of the Murder and Robbery Unit were mustering for parade when a police radio report of the shooting was broadcast.  In consequence thereof, my colleagues and I hastened to the scene.  I arrived to find members of the Security Police, the Riot Squat, the Guguletu Police, the Flying Squad and others on the scene.  The area had already been cordoned off.\nMajor Brits who was the senior rank in Murder and Robbery Officer at the scene was assigned to the investigation and I assisted him to the best of my ability with the preservation of the scene and the collection of evidence.  My colleague and I, detective Warrant Officer Welcome Mbele, performed these task together.  To the best of my recall, the only action taken by my which was not directly related to the investigation was taken in collaboration with the explosive expert on the scene, the then detective Warrant Officer Schalk van der Merwe.  There was a reasonable fear that there might be an unexploded device under one of the bodies on the scene and a rope was attached to the belt of this victim.  The body was then pulled over onto its back from a distance, for the purpose of safety only.\nThereafter Warrant Officer Mbele and I went to each body, made notes of the positions in which the bodies lay, the clothing of the bodies, what weapons [if any] were in the deceased possession and what wound each deceased had sustained.  I also searched each body and removed items of value such as jewelly, money and correspondence.  Items removed from each body were placed in individual transparent plastic bags.  As standard procedure, I wore gloves.  Later that day I handed all the exhibits and the records of observations to Major Brits.  I went about  investigating the matter on the scene as I would investigate any other violent crime.  I acted objectively, without preconceived notions and, I respectfully believed professionally.\n7. Whilst I was at the scene more and more senior officers \narrived the then Divisional Investigations Officer.  The scene was photographed and videotaped.  A helicopter hovered overhead.  The traffic noise from the nearby freeway and the noise on the scene was excessive and disturbing.\n8. At approximately 1200 after all investigations had been \ncompleted and in full view of local bystanders, media representatives and colleagues, I instructed that blood be washed from the streets.  My sole motivation for doing this was in the belief in the dignity of death.  I had previously experienced dogs arriving on the scene of a violent crime, licking the blood.  This I did not wish to happen.  I acted out of this motive of respect for the dead and their loved ones only when giving this instruction and seeing that it was carried out, which it was, publicly and openly.\n9. I left the scene about half an hour later and had no \nfurther involvement in the investigation.  I am unable to comment on the investigation or the manner in which it was conducted.\n10. In the spirit of reconciliation, I would like to add that I regard it as a tragedy that seven young men died as a result of the evil of a political system which caused so much pain and suffering to all the peoples of our country.  In addition, I could so easily have lost colleagues on that day during the fire fight which I am given to understand took place between the security forces and the deceased.  If I had been empowered and in a position to do so, I would have taken steps to avoid the tragedy.  I personally regard it as unfortunate that I was not able to do so.\n11. I have considerable experience of the pain and anguish \nwhich is suffered by the loved ones of victims of violence.  I can therefore appreciate the suffering endured by the families of the seven young men in question and wish that could have been averted.  I extend my sympathy to those who were affected by the occurrences of the day in question.\n Thank you.",

It then remains for me to do the necessary namely to express my sincerest gratitude to all those who have made these proceedings the success that they have been.  In particular I must thank the general public for the controlled way in which they conducted themselves during the course of these proceedings.  Although I have had occasion to [indistinct] one or two cell phones for users thereof , generally the conduct of the public was such as it should be expected from a public in the conditions of this nature.\n I must also thank the - I don't know how  to pronounce this but the EON group who have made these facilities available for us - we are very thank full I am also reminded that we have had no power failure during the course of these proceedings it would have been a sorry sight if we had that, because I believe this is a theatre so we have to thank those that have made it possible.\n I am also asked to thank Telkom and which I do, I am not particularly aware in what respect Telkom comes for special mention.  But sometimes when you are the Chair you just do as you are told which is what I am doing.\n But from me I must indicate that the families who have come here, and have in spite of the pain that this obviously evokes, been able to sit through and listen they are thanked for having come and in the true spirit and tradition of what the Truth and Reconciliation Commission stands for, one would hope that this process to the extend that it exposes some truths whichever way the truth exposes itself as - will ultimately lead to healing - will ultimately lead to reconciliation.\n And I must in equal breath thank the witnesses who have come, I must thank the police who have braved it because this is a matter that has received public attention and it's something that 10 years later seems to be as alive now as it then was when it went through public inquest - Tony Weaver trials and related public inquiries.  And there is a sense in which it becomes  an albatross around anybody's neck to have something of this nature not going away.\n So the presence of the police who came here and endeavoured to give their own perspective is very much appreciated.  Because indeed without their own input the Commission's work will fail because as advocate Potgieter has said and most of the panellist indicated in their questioning, ours is that difficulty of endeavouring to find where the truth lies.  So that at the end of the day, we should be able to make recommendations that are commensurate with what we believe we have been able to get at inquiries of this nature.\n And without the victims and survivors families and the witnesses in the form of the police who were involved on this day in question, we shall never know, it should never be forgotten that we were not there, and we can only know what happened when we weight the testimony of those who have been involved.\n And lastly but not in the least - thank are due to the ministry of safety and security who have provided the necessary security and I would like to be able to think that much of the tranquillity with which this proceedings were held, and the utmost fear that could easily and potentially have been out of hand but which otherwise was a  calm one and conducive for everybody to be able to speak their minds has been largely due to the fact that people came here in the fair secure knowledge that they would be safe in their bodies.\n That is the long list that I have found and at the end of a weary day, let me thank everybody and let me declare these proceedings to be adjourned.",
