I was returning from St Joseph School where I dropped three pupils which attended St Joseph School at std 7.  And I was on my way, going over Guguletu bridge to Manenberg area where I have to pick up children to take them to Astra School which was at that time in Wittebome.  \nOn my way, over the bridge, I was stopped.  I came upon a lot of policemen standing in the  road and what is it now - Army - they were dressed like that and I stopped - pulled my -   I stopped the bus.  There was a man lying in the road.  According to me he was alive, but he never moved.\nAnd then amongst - amongst the lot that was there - a European policeman came up - out of the crowd and he approached the man laying on the ground.  And  he took out - I don't know if it was a revolver or a pistol and he shot this man twice through the head.   In front of me, in front of the 13 children that was in the bus, plus their housemother. \n After he had shot this man, he approached the bus - on the drivers side.  He came to me - he said to me in Afrikaans - wat de donder maak jy hier?  What the hell  are you doing here with these children - and   I never answered him.  So I just reversed back - there was cars behind me - I couldn't - but they gave way for me and I turned the bus around and I went the other way around.\nOn my way I started picking up children.  When I came down to Farouk's house, the housemother that was on the bus, she went inside the house - and then she broke down.  So the mother of this child came to me - so I said to her you know - I explained to her what had happened.  \nAnd I  said to her, she must give her something you know - Lewensessens or in that case, something to drink and this she did.   And then we approached and we got to the school, where,  after I have unloaded the children, to the various classes - and then I went to the office - at that time Mr Ralph, he was our principle - and then I spoke to him.  Told him what happened, what we have seen and then in the office - at that time was our psychologist - Ms Saffier and she also heard what happened, and then she said to me that she is going to call in Mr Van der Merwe.  I must speak to him.  I must tell him what happened.\nAnd so the story came - that he came to me, and then the court case of Mr Weaver, that just gave testimony - they called - his lawyer called me to appear as witness and then I went to testify in court - what happened.\n I think that is about all.",
