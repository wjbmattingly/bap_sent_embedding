            "verklaar hiermee soos volg\n 1. Ek is 'n volwasse man en 'n gewese lid van die Suid-\nAfrikaanse Polisiediens.  Gedurende 1986 was ek 'n majoor in die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie, verbonde aan die Afdeling Onluste-eenheid, Westelike Provinsie, waar ek diens verrig het as die offisier tweede in bevel van die eenheid..\n2. Ek het 'n kennisgewing ontvang om te kom getuig voor die \nKommissie vir die Waarheid en Versoening oor 'n voorval op 3 Maart 1986 waartydens sewe persone gedood is te Guguletu.\n3. Uit die aard van die saak is my geheue oor die voorval wat meer as \ntien jaar gelede plaasgevind het, nie meer so helder nie.  Ek het egter my geheue verfris aan die hand van twee beedigde verklarings wat ek met betrekking tot die voorval afgele het onderskeidelik op 1 April 1986 en 15 Oktober 1986, sowel as die getuienis wat ek afgele het uit die vervolging van die destydse redakteur van die Cape Times koerant, mnr A Weaver.\n4. Op Sondag 2 Maart 1986 laat die namiddag of vroeg die aand is ek \nte Wingfield deur Luitenant Liebenberg en Sersant Bellingham, wat beide verbonde was aan die Veiligheidstak, meegedeel dat hulle inligting ontvang het vanaf 'n bron dat 'n polisie Datsun E20 bussie wat daagliks lede en administratiewe personeel tussen Bellville en Guguletu polisiestasie vervoer het, na bewering op die hoeke van NY1 en NY111 Guguletu aangeval sou word die volgende oggend met die oog daarop om die insittendes te dood.  Ons het beplan wat gedoen moet word om die aanval af te weer en die verdagtes te arresteer indien hulle sou probeer om die bussie aan te val.\n5. Op 3 Maart 1986 om ongeveer 02h30 het ek bevel geneem van die \npolisielede wat die verwagte aanval sou moes verhoed en die verdagtes sou moes arresteer.  Die lede is almal ingelig omtrent die inligting wat ontvang was en ek het die persone opdrag gegee om op sekere stragetiese punte in die gebied waar die verwagte aanval sou plaasvind, stelling in te neem.  Hierna het ons beweeg na die area.\n6. Ek en vyf van die lede onder my bevel het posisie ingeneem aan die \noostekant van NY1 en onsself tussen die bosse versteek.  Ons was in posisie teen ongeveer 0500 die oggend.  Ek kan onthou dat gerapporteer is dat die polisiebussie sonder probleme deur die kruising beweeg het en dat dit veilig die Guguletu polisiestasie bereik het.  Presies wat daarna gebeur het, is ek nie heeltemal seker oor nie, maar om ongeveer 0725 het 'n Datsun E20 bussie wat voldoen het aan die beskrywing van die aanvallers se bussie, van suid na noord stadig in NY1 voor my verby beweeg.  Daar was slegs 'n nommerplaat voor aan die bussie.\n7. Kort daarna het ek vier Swartmans sien loop in NY111 in 'n \nwestelike rigting. Hulle het NY1 gekruis en een van die mans het op\ndie noordwestelike hoek van NY111 en NY1 gaan staan en dit het \nvir my voorgekom asof hy wou water afslaan.\n8. Ek het gesien dat Kaptein Kleyn en twee van sy manne in 'n motor \nin 'n oostelike rigting in NY111, die drie mans wat reeds besig was\nom in 'n westelike rigting te stap, nader en voor die persone stilhou.  \nKaptein Kleyn het uitgeklim en een van die mans het 'n voorwerp in \ndie rigting van die motor gegooi.  Ek het onmiddellik aan die \npersone saam met my geskree dat daar 'n handgranaat gegooi \nword.  Kaptein Kleyn het platgeval en daar was 'n ontploffing links \nvan die motor.\n9. Al drie mans het in 'n noordwestelike rigting na die nabygelee bosse \nbegin hardloop, en ek het gesien dat van die persone in Kaptein Kleyn se groep op hulle vuur.\n10. Ek het opgespring en met NY1 in 'n noordelike rigting gehardloop.  \nEk het opgemerk dat Adjudant Offisier Barnard en nog een van sy manne besig was om agter die drie mans aan te hardloop.  Ek het opgemerk dat dieselfde wit E20 bussie besig was om in 'n suidelike rigting in NY1 die betrokke kruising te nader.\n11. Terwyl ek hardloop het ek kort-kort sarsies skote agter my, naby die \nbetrokke kruising gehoor.  My aandag was egter op die voortvlugtende handgranaatgooier.  Ek het gesien dat hy val, maar hy het aangehou hardloop en na regs opgeswaai na die brug om te kyk of van die aanvallers nie aan die ander kant van die bosse uitgekom het nie.  Ek het egter niemand daar gesien nie.\n[En ek gaan vir u nou wys hoe ek op gehardloop het, ek sal weer terugkom.  Die doel hoekom ek by die bruggie op gehardloop het, was om te sien of van die persone wat in die bosse in hardloop nie miskien aan die ander kant uitkom op die N2 waar die groot pad geloop het nie, ek het egter niemand daar gesien nie].\n12. Nadat ek myself tevrede gestel het, dat my manne die situasie \nonder beheer het, het ek teruggekeer na die kruising van NY1 en\nNY111.  By my aankoms het ek die verdagte wit bussie op die \nsuidwestelike hoek van NY1 en NY111 aangetref met 'n Swartman, \nvermoedelik een van die aanvallers wat langs die bussie dood gele \nhet.  'n Ander Swartman het op die suidoostelike hoek van NY1 en \nNY111 gele met 'n AK-geweer en drie magasyne onder hom.\n13. In NY111 op die sypaadjie het ek nog 'n Swartman aangetref met 'n \nhandgranaat langs hom.  Op die noordwestelike hoek van NY1 en NY111 is daar nog 'n Swartman aangetref met 'n vuurwapen op sy maag.  Al die persone was dood.\n14. Met verdere ondersoek het ek 'n Swartman op die noordelike kant \nvan NY111 dood aangetref.  Dit was die persoon wat volgens my\nwaarnemings die handgranaat na Kaptein Kleyn gegooi het.\n15. Verder die bosse in het ek nog twee Swartmans dood aangetref.  By \ndie een het 'n pistool gele en by die ander een tussen sy bene 'n\nhandgranaat.\n16. Ek self het geen skote afgevuur tydens hierdie voorval nie, behalwe \ndat ek gesien het dat die persone in Kaptein Kleyn se groep, vuur in\ndie rigting van die voortvlugtende handgranaatgooier.  Ek het ook \nnie gesien hoedat enige van die ander oorledenes gedood is nie.\n17. Sover ek kan onthou was opdragte aan die lede gegee om te \nverhoed dat die aanval uitgevoer word en dat gepoog moes word\nom die aanvallers te arresteer, afhangende van omstandighede en \nmet begrip van die veiligheid van die lid of lede wat die arrestasie \nsou uitvoer.  Uit die aard van die saak, was die bepalings van die \nStrafproseswet 1977 met betrekking tot die uitvoer van arrestasie en \ndie gebruik van geweld van toepassing op die situasie.",

If I understood your evidence well, and you'll correct me if I am wrong, in - when you read your statement and when you were being asked questions by other members of the panel - it seems to me at one stage, when once your police bus had gone past the place where it was expected to be attacked and had reached it's destination.  You then - in all the areas in which you had been placed, in other words the police - began to take the view that the attack is not going to take place on that day.  And it was at that stage that you, you as a person, began to see people walking on foot at about the intersection.  \nAnd I think what advocate Potgieter is trying to establish from you, is whether an effort was made at all by the police to arrest these people.  For instance, was there any endeavour made through a loud hailer  - seeing that you had surrounded these people from the description of how the police were placed.  \nWas there for instance a loud hailer that was used to say - we have reason to believe that you are the people who were planning to commit a crime - that you are so and so and so and so.  But that we must warn you that you are completely surrounded - that you must surrender and if you don't we will have to defend ourselves?\nWas there anything of that nature that was attempted - when they were walking there.
