They found me on the second street, where I had fallen.  Some boys took me and when I woke up I was at the surgery of Doctor Mteto.  I'm not sure that it was Doctor Mteto, when I woke up I was at the surgery that is next to the supermarket but I've forgotten his surname.  It's Doctor Babe.  Upon our arrival the Doctor told me that he won't be able to treat me and I should be transferred to the hospital.\n When we arrived at the hospital, I was admitted and stayed there for three months if I'm not mistaken.

This morning I heard you refer to a Doctor Mteto and a Doctor Babe.  I just want clarity because if the names are going out into the open, we're reflecting on professional people and I would ask you to be very cautious.
