            "On the twentieth of May 1976 we had Black Power here in Witbank.  I was working for the hospital and the kids came at about three and told me that the violence had erupted in the location.  I knocked off at half past four.  I was with David Nbenegazi, my friend.  We were walking when we came across a group of youths throwing stones.\n On Friday the 23rd, at half past four, the police came to my work.   Juza Sithole and another White policeman and Juza approached me and said, JC, my nickname is JC, he would like to question me with regard to the Black Power and they took with them.  When we went towards the White hospital they used their telephone in the car and spoke about something.  When we got the Medical Centre we got out the car, now we have Cosmos offices there and I found a man waiting for me there and he said to me, you are a preacher's son but you are full of nonsense and they handcuffed me.  He made it so tight that I felt pain and he took me into a room and kept me there.  \n At about six they took me out of that room and showed me three other students, George, Jeremy Mabeni and Makuskus Nkosi.  They had injured them with their handcuffs as well.  They told me that if I don't want to tell the truth, they will torture me.  They took me back into one room where there was a CID by the name of Skusana and they tried to strangle me.  They tortured me and also covered my face so that I don't see anything.  There were some chemicals that they inserted as well so that I'd suffocate and they told me to sit down.  I told them I can't sit down because I can't see anything.  They entwined my feet and made me carry this heavy wood with my right hand.  That's the fashion they tortured me in.  They asked me if I was an ANC member and they asked me if I knew anything about the Black Power and I said, no.  They opened my stomach, they cut open my stomach.  There was Olivier and Mashlango who is late.  He was interpreting for me whilst the other White man was talking in Afrikaans.  They asked me if I knew anything about Black Power and I said, no.  They burnt me on my neck and on my testicles as well.  They said if I don't want to tell the truth and put the truth on the table, I will regret it.  \n I heard the door open and I wondered what they were up to them.  They asked me if I was ready to say something and I said, there is nothing that I know.  They also burnt me on my testicles again and I urinated on myself.  The other three that they showed me,  Makuskus is my relative, she's my cousin.  When she saw me she screamed and said, why do you torture him that way?  They kicked her as well and I was taken into a dark cell in isolation.  \n On Saturday they took me to the district surgeon, Doctor Joint who gave me some pills to take.  On Monday I was taken to the Court of Law and the case was remanded and I was sent to Paxton.  They fetched me on Thursday but they didn't torture me then.  They even bought me a packet of cigarettes.  They were adamant, wanting me to tell them what I knew about the Black Power and they wanted Papa Roy.  I knew Papa Roy and the other three boys.  I've forgotten their names.  I heard Papa Roy and those boys.  They thought I was an ANC member or I was part of the Black Power.  They wanted those boys.  \n I was acquitted and they left me alone after that.  I was suspended for not being at work.  I lost my job, especially because my boss at work was influenced in one way or the other.  I only have Standard Eight.  That's all I want to say.",

The reason why that question of the UDF has come all the time is because UDF was not formed until the '80's and that's why people have kept asking about the UDF.  Thank you very, very much for coming and sharing your experiences to-day.
