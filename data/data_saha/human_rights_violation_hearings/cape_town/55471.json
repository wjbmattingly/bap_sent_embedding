            "Firstly, I would ask everybody to pray God to give me strength because I know it is going to be difficult for me to say this.  It was 19(?) at the end of October, when it was during the day on that day.  I felt drowsy and then I lie down. I was at the shacks at Crossroads when this group that was led by Yamile. Whilst I was lying there, about an hour thereafter, a small girl came in, who used to stay with my sister.  It was a neighbour's daughter and she woke me up because her mother has been hurt and now she is being taken to be burnt.  So I rose, I got up.  I didn't even put on my shoes because I didn't feel anything. When I got up I went with this child and I lost energy, but I prayed God to give me strength, because I didn't know what I was going to see ahead of me.  When I got there and I could see her clothes and there was blood spattered and I was about to scream. A neighbour took me to the house and pleaded with me not to identify myself as her sister, because I would also be injured.\n What has happened, she came with a leader of this group who was Jerry and another man called Radebe, who was her friend, coming to collect her clothes, because she was going to the township because there was - life was difficult for him.  So she had come to take these clothes, because she didn't want stay there any more, she wanted to go to the township.  So she came with Jerry and Radebe and they were chasing them, because they wanted to kill them. These two ran away and she remained.  Then they said okay, you also know everything.  So they took her and took a hammer. They hit her on her skull, gouged her ears and took them out, cut her stomach. I don't know what happened to the child, but they opened the child and hurting her, and then they took her, put her on a towel sheet and burnt her.  And that's when I came, there was smoke, and the neighbour said to me if you can withstand that, you can go back, never identify yourself. Because I wanted to save myself, I don't want you to go there because they will also say, if I tell you, they will say I am an informer.  So I said well, I am going to go and tell friends because the people that don't even want anyone coming here.  \n I was very heartsore, because I didn't know what they are going to do with her, because I didn't know what to say to her children.  So I left. I went to look for friends and the gentleman next to me and other friends, which was a very sad moment for me, because they were not there. I had to explain to them what had happened.  I had to explain to them what had happened because they were not there.  They were at the hostels. \n So I walked. I was without shoes and I was not even aware, realising it when I was already at Guguletu that I did not have shoes. So I looked for them and I met them and I explained to them that my sister is deceased, and she has been hurt to death and she was burnt.  We went to the police at Guguletu station, and we asked for help just to go and collect the remains there so that we could be able to bury them.  When we were there, the police said if you can't deal with your own people, what do you expect us to do.  We spent some time and until sunset and then they said go and sleep, we will come and see tomorrow morning and see what we can do.",

Now we discover that the police had taken her but we don't know who went with the police, but there were some people who knew her and they did try to take her to the mortuary, but we didn't know which mortuary it was.  The people who were there were scared to meet us.  So we went around looking at the mortuaries and found her at Salt River.  Where I was not even able to look at her, because at that stage I was still 22 years old, very young.  I didn't have the strength to look at her. So I asked my brother, cousin to look at her, just to confirm it was her.  Then I was asked as a sister to sign.  We stayed there for a week and then we went to fetch her to bury her in Butterworth at home.\n When we came back, because I knew I was not going to - I didn't know who I was going to report to, because I didn't know these people and I was - they were a group, so it was quiet for a while.",
