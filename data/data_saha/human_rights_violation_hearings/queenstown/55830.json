            "Yes, I can explain.  In 1993 the COSAS asked that students should go and march in town.  Then on Friday there is a river in our town, on a  Friday there were many policemen beyond the river stopping people not to go to town until twelve o'clock when the school children would be taking their complaints to town.\n So the school children went to town.  When they were near a certain policeman, superintendent's office, they were asked to stop by the policemen.\n They then went back to the office and on their way, there is an office there which they burnt.  When the soldiers saw that this office was burning, they came to the school children and the school children ran away and got into the location, the old location.\n The policemen parked their hippo's next to the office and walked to the location.  Then my son as he was running towards a certain house, which is near our home, they closed him out.\n Two policemen came towards him and shot him at the back of the head and he fell at the gate of that particular house.  They grabbed him and put him at the doorstep at another house and phoned for other policemen who came and threw him at the back of the van.\n They kept him for two weeks at the police station.  We went there as parents to ask what he had done.  Then we were told that we should come and identify him the following Monday.\n Men then went there together with his brother to identify the body.  Then they asked the brother to sign that QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 B MBALO\nit was really him who had died.\n Then they asked him as the person who had seen the body to sign.  We again went there on a Monday as parents to ask what he had actually done, then they said the case was in the jurisdiction of Queenstown, so we did not go to Queenstown, because we felt they were fooling us, because this actually happened in Sterkstroom.\n They kept him for a week and released him on a Friday, gave the body to us on a Friday and he was buried on a Saturday.  I did not see the policeman taking any photo's at the scene of the death, I also had to cover his blood.\n Then his uncle assisted me in the covering of the blood.  Time went on and it was quite a time with us waiting for the policemen to call us to go to court.\n And they never came.  I then in 1994 went to the Magistrate to ask them when were they actually going to call us as the parents, calling us to court.\n They said they had written a letter to Grahamstown and the reply stated that they had called us long ago.  At the time my son was asked to sign by the police, the policeman made as if that child was going to go to court at that time, and that child did not know anything about that.\n That was the last letter I got from Grahamstown.  Actually there was no court case on this matter up to date.   A policeman called Costa is the one who shot him, but he is still putting on the police uniform.  The mother to this child fell sick because there had been tear gas, a lot of tear gas in the location.\n The policemen were throwing tear gas in the location and the mother to this child got suffocated and then the Doctor said he was suffering from cancer.\nQUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n4 B MBALO\n This year in February she died with that pain, because she kept on asking where are we going to court.  Then I told her I had tried all the means, but there had been no response to this effect and I told her I did not even have money for the lawyers to go and find out.\n So my sister died in February.   That's the end.",
