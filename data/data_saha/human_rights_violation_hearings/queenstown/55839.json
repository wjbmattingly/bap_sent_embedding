Now I am not talking about individual remembrances, I am talking about a community remembrance.  Have you thought about it?  Dr Ramashala would like to know if you people have thought of any way in which you, you the families of the 11 would like them to be remembered?  the 11 QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n34\npeople who died in that Methodist Church on that day, have you thought of a way in which they can be remembered?  If you haven't thought about it yet, say so.  If you have, you can say what ideas you have.",

            "Mothers and comrades, we thank you for coming to share this with us.  This event which I am sure will never be forgotten.\n And which is very painful and very emotional where you lost loved ones.  South Africa would have made a mistake, an unforgivable mistake if because of being preoccupied with other things, it would forget about people such as yourselves.\n And forget to say thank you.  And overlook the high price that you paid for the freedom of this land.\n You have made various requests here as families and you have made a request as a group.  If it was up to us, we would say here is an answer right now, but this Commission does not have the authority to respond to the request immediately.\n Our work ends after we have made recommendations to the President of the Country and it is the President of the Country in conjunction with the Cabinet who will decide what the people of Queenstown, who have lost loved ones in that Methodist Church, will be - what will be done about them.\n We will make sure that we forward your requests to the President and the answer will be obtained from him in due course and it will be forwarded back to you.\n Finally, I would like to make one last appeal.  My \nQUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n35\nappeal is directed to the policemen who were involved on that day.\n You said in your testimony that there were White policemen and Black policemen.  I'd like to specifically ask the Black policemen who were there that day, I hope it will not be necessary for us to investigate this matter.\n The Black policemen should be able to, especially as children of Mlungisi, be able to come to the Commission.  Even if they came to me or any of the panellists here and came to tell us who were the people who were responsible for this.\n We are not supposed to conduct an investigation and waste time where there are those who have information that can help us in finding out who was responsible for this.\n I would just like to make that appeal that those that were involved, must please come forward so that there can be peace and reconciliation among the people and among the families of the 11 people who died at Mlungisi.\n I would now like to ask you to go back to your seats, we are going to take our last witness before we conclude today's proceedings.  Thank you very much.",
