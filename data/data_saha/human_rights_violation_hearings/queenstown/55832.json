The statement that was given to us, came from your mother who gave us some idea of the background to the incident that happened to you in August 1985, but we are happy that you are here personally so that you can give us a first hand account of actually what happened on this particular day.\n So please relax and tell us exactly what happened when you were injured.",

            "It was in August 1985 when we were at school the big boys instructed us to leave school because in the afternoon we were going to a meeting, so we did exactly that.\n In the afternoon we went to Masesames School, but I did not get inside, I stood outside, because it was full in the room.  So we talked that they were forcing us to be taught in Afrikaans, so we toyi-toyed and I decided to go home.\n The following day at about five o'clock, I was on my way to the shop to buy paraffin.  As I was walking in a passage going back home, I saw a hippo from afar, but I couldn't see who the policemen were who were driving this \nQUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 N CHARLIE\nhippo.\n That was the last time I can remember, then I don't know what later happened thereafter, because I think they shot me and left me there.\n Someone picked me up from there and they did not know me, they took me there and someone just left there.  My whole body was covered with blood, they hit me on my eye.  I could not be taken to a Doctor because those days you would be arrested if you were taken to any Doctor, so I kept indoors.\n Late at night, the police came and knocked.  I said to my mother, oh, please, hide me.  They came, then my mother saw one called Cross  saying VIVA.  Then this policeman asked where is Nombulelo, then my mother said, I don't know Nombulelo.\n Then they said is the child here who has been shot on the eye, then they took my brother away.  After three weeks my aunt who used to work for a particular Doctor asked me to go and hand myself over.\n So they took me to a Doctor and the Doctor said I was to go to a Hospital in East London, so I did go there.  I was there for about two weeks and they said they were going to take my whole eye out, because it was spoilt, so I had to go back home and wait for the Specialist.\n My brother gave me the money for travelling because my parents were not working at the time.  I then went back to hospital and then they were going to take out the eye and put in an artificial eye and they were asking for R285-00, then I agreed, so they put in this artificial eye and we paid the R285-00 for this.\n I used to go for treatment frequently, I still go for \nQUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 N CHARLIE\nthe treatment even now.  Then one bullet was here on the forehead and it was taken out and one that was in the head, could  not be taken out.\n I sometimes have headaches.  Some other times I would go to the Hospital in Sterkspruit for treatment, but now I've come back.  That is all I have to say.\n Even those policemen who shot me, never got arrested.",
