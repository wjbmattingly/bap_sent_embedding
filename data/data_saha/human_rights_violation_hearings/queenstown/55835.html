<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>husband, when he was seen, found by a shop owner, what had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> This is what happened.  I last saw him on the 26th and he was going towards Tendergate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a> I then slept.  When I woke up the next morning ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was he on his way to a meeting or was he on other business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> ; No, he was on other business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a> When I woke up the following day, I saw people arriving and this shop owner as well, and I could see that he had gathered these people all night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a> This man said at approximately 8 o'clock, he saw a police van arriving at his place with this man inside, my husband now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a> The police had said that they had found him along the way and that he should please identify him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a> The policeman opened the van and he looked at my husband and said that he knows him and that it is someone that lives not too far from there and he wanted to know what the matter was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a> The policeman said no, we don't know, we just saw him, by the side of the road, just laying there.  When we looked, he seemed like someone that had been injured and we tried to get help for him at the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a> I then said, well fine, let us go to another man from the Hicqa clan and he didn't see him either.  And then they went to this man.  This man looked at him and recognised him and also asked what the matter was and the police explained how they had found him and said that they are going to take him for help because it is possible that he might, you know, he might be attended to.</p>

<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> He said when he looked at him, he could see that he was not alive any more, but the policemen were saying that they were taking him for help, maybe he'd get better.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was your husband in any position in the ANC, was he a Chairman or anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> No, he was not anything.  He was not an office bearer, he was merely a supporter of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> They then took him to the mortuary and then the policemen arrived at your place at some other stage and said that they had arrested the people responsible?</p>

<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> The police came back to tell us that we just want to inform you that these people have been released.  One of them had phoned Gqozo and Gqozo had instructed that they be released and be given their sticks and go and do their work, and they were then released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> The one by the name of Nkoliseko Mrola, what was his role in all this?</p>

<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Is he the one who disappeared?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> Yes, the one that up to this day we don't know where he is.  Maqwalo is the one taken by Nkoliseko Mrola and he then called the people and they caught him and he told them everything and Nkoliseko said that now I was told to bring him from the graveyard there at the bottom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a> They wanted to know what were you going to do with him and he said, no we are going to kill him and then Nkoliseko disappeared because he realised that these people were after him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a> We were informed that attorneys had taken him to Bisho and that was the last I heard about Mrola.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> That Mrola said that these six people were responsible for your husband's death?</p>

<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> After your husband's death, was there any trial or inquest into the cause of his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was your husband taken to hospital and was the Doctor able to say what the cause of his death was?</p>

<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did the trial then not proceed because of an order from Gqozo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> ; No, nothing came of it, the police came back to my house and said that they were sent by the Government to tell me that the case is going to be conducted in Bisho, but the day on which it is going to be conducted, I must wait that they will come and fetch me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a> Up until today, I am still waiting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was you husband working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> He was not working.  No he was not working, he was someone who was doing his own thing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Is there anything that you would like to ask the Commission to do for you?  Any way in which the Commission can be of assistance to you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> A tombstone?  What else Ma'am?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> Since my husband's death I am battling at home.</p>

<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>6 NN DYWASHU</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How was your health affected by this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> I have never been healthy, I am still under a Doctor's care ever since then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What is the main problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> I suffer from short breath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you receive any pension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How much do you, oh, you receive a pension?</p>

<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What are their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> Mqweqwe is in standard 6.  Mpoqwana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What standard is Mpoqwana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">NN DYWASHU:</span> He is in standard 1 and then Boqelani is in standard 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you very much.  Back to you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Nohombile, I do not think you know the way in which you people touch us.  After having gone through such suffering, and when asked what the Commission can do for you, you merely ask for tombstones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a> That touches us very deeply to see the manner in which your thoughts are so humble.  In stead of asking for a lot of things from the Government you merely ask that tombstones be put on your loved ones' graves.  Whenever I hear that request, I am so deeply touched, because it is a request from very humble people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a> We thank you for your evidence and thank you also for the love that you have shown towards your husband even </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>7</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>though he is no longer with you through your request to the Commission on behalf of yourself and your children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a> I also want to reiterate once more that there is nothing that the Commission can do on its own, we cannot make any final decisions on our own, but we rather have to make submissions to the President who will then in consultation with the Cabinet, reach a final decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a> But I would like you to know that we have heard, we have taken cognisance of what you have said and we thank you for coming forward and we will now like to thank you and ask you to take your seat.  Thank you.</p>
