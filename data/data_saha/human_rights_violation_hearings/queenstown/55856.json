It went on and on until it was late at night, then I asked where was my child, when I got to consciousness.\nQUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 MR WATIZA\n That is when they told that my child had been taken away by the comrades and taken to a mortuary in a van.\n So they had taken him there.  The comrades asked Inxaba who was going to conduct the funeral, because you could see this woman was not in a position to, then Els could not tell.\n Then he said we should go to jail.  The comrades took me the following day and we went there to the jail.  Els told us that on the day of the funeral, we should inform the jail, but there were no decisions taken by the jail people because they felt that these children were silly and this was not true.\n I waited, then the comrades buried the child and it just ended there.
