At each corner of each street there was a group of youths and we were chanting freedom songs, but no stone-throwing was taking place.  As we were chanting, after a few minutes I saw a police Hippo coming and they started firing. I am referring to the soldiers.  We took different directions and people went to nearby places and I decided to run towards my home, because the tear-gas was now burning in my eyes.   I got into the house and my mother saw me and I was shouting \"my eyes, my eyes\".  She closed the doors and she applied Vicks and other ointments on my eyes, but they couldn't help at all.\n In 1987 I have been to doctors and this other one was Dr Van Graan and my mother explained everything to him.  She told him that I was tear-gassed and my eyes are troubling me.  He said my mother must not tell that it was tear-gas that affected my eyes.   He said he will transfer me to St. John's and the tablets that he gave me were very strong.   Every time I put my glasses on I would be dizzy.  We went back to him to explain to him that I feel very dizzy every time I put on these glasses.  He then took me to St. John's. I was told that I will have to undergo an operation.  Yes, they operated me at St. John's and after the operation I lost my eyesight until at this stage where I cannot see.\n Even now, I am suffering.  I should have been at school but I cannot, because my eyes are itching at all times and I am in and out of the hospital.",
