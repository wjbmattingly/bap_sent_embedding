            "Richard was a student at the University of the North in Pietersburg. In 1984 he came home to Schweizer-Reneke.  In that same year of 1984, he was employed at Vryburg as a teacher at Magamang High School.  It took about six months in the same year 1984, and Richard came home in a car with three men.  He was the fourth.  He only greeted us and he said they were going somewhere.  He was asked at home now what about your job. He said no, the job will have to wait for some time.  He didn't spend a lot of time at\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 G LENTSELA\nhome, it was about ten minutes and they drove off in this white Mercedes-Benz car.  That was the last day we saw him.\n Thereafter police came in large numbers.  They were troubling me at least twice or three times in the week.  Both in daylight and at night.  They would be carrying guns, looking for him. They asked us whether we know his whereabouts and we said no, we do not know.  They were impatient when we told them that we do not know his whereabouts.  They would come in the night and they would surround the house.  \n There was just one White person called Potgieter.  We were told he was from Klerksdorp.  He would come into the house alone and he would search all the rooms in the house.  Where my sisters are asleep he would pick up the blankets with the torch in his hand and he would search even underneath the beds.\n One day, you know, I do not know them, but one day it was during the day, when he came in with a policeman I knew, and this policeman worked in Schweizer-Reneke before, it was Zipo Khatela.  He was tampering, he was just a pain in our lives.  \n In 1986 I met this other gentleman called Wesley Maklopane.  He was working at Kimberley.  He said to me he knows Buchi Richard Lentsela, and he said to me man, I think Richard has been killed towards the Warrenton direction.  He said it was just a rumour, he will investigate this matter. I stood still.  He said Potgieter has been saying that wherever he meets him he is going to kill him.   \n I must tell you, in that year of 1986, Potgieter was so quiet, he didn't come to pester us at home any more. I stayed in that condition. If I don't forget, after about two KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 G LENTSELA\nmonths the Vryburg branch of the ANC held a rally at Schweizer-Reneke and there were pamphlets.  Now in these pamphlets names of four people were written. These are the names of the people who were killed.  He was the last to appear on that pamphlet, Richard Lentsela.\n I got the shock of my life. I said what Wesley told me was the truth.  At the same time there were people wearing T-shirts and on their T-shirts the death of Richard Lentsela was printed. It came to my mind that this White man must have killed Richard.\n I went to Vryburg, because I was told the pamphlets were from Vryburg. I went to the constituency office of the ANC and on my arrival they told me that they only heard.  They said they didn't even see it with their eyes, they were told that he was killed in Warrenton and the police themselves buried him.  I do not know are they the police in Warrenton or is it Potgieter, because he was actually the person hunting this boy.\n Even this year, in July, I have been to Vryburg, trying to get to the root of this matter. I was told that this matter is still under investigation, they want to investigate as to who killed him and where was he buried. I told them, I said please get hold of the perpetrator.  I further told them that if they had identified the spot where he is buried, I would request the government to help me to exhume his body so that we can bury him in our traditional way.  It would be much better to take his remains to come and bury them at home.  That will be the end of my story.",

            "Thank you.  Mr Lentsela and Mr Daniel Lentsela, father of Richard, I thank you for coming all the way from Schweizer-Reneke today to come and tell us the story of Richard.   We have heard stories of many, many disappearances.  Often people don't even known where their loved ones are.  You were given some information about Richard and that he may have passed away, but even then there must still be uncertainty, and to live with that uncertainty on the one side must be very painful, and even if there was certainty, it must be painful to lose someone,\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n10 G LENTSELA\na son indeed, who held so much promise, but decided for reasons best known to himself at the time, to go on a different path. \n I would like to say that as far as these forms go that you mention, I am sure there are many ANC people here today who should be able to inform you.  So you don't have to wait to go to Vryburg.  These are, as I understand it again, government forms.  It is a government issue now, it is not even an ANC issue.  So those forms should be available through most of our offices.  Therefore, if you can act on that very quickly.  \n I would also like to say that we will try through our investigative unit, to determine what happened at Warrenton and also to determine from the ANC whether they have any information about this incident that happened at Warrenton, and we will let you know as soon as possible. \n I thank you very much for coming.",
