He was from his mother's home to his younger brother's home.  When he passed in the direction of our home, he was standing and other children were there.  At home they were toyi-toying.  Then the Hippo passed, the first one passed.  Then it turned at the circle.  Then it returned to Makweti.  The second police van passed again.  Then one policeman appeared who was hefty.  He showed my uncle a gun and then he shot him with bullets.  The first bullet was on the mouth, the second one on the heart, the third one on the waist.  Then he died dinstantly.\n At the time the hearse was called, together with an ambulance. When the two cars arrived, one called Joubert asked somebody and said who shot. The other said the person who shot is Steven.  Then he said who is Steven?  Then he said Steven who was working with you at the hospital.  Then he said who shot?  Then he said the second Hippo is where the bullets were coming from.  Then he called to stop them. Then they came.  Then he asked them, why did you shoot this man?  Then he said it was a mistake, I was not sure that I will be able to shoot him.  Then he said look, what have you done, is you have shot an innocent person.  Then they took out the stretcher and put him in an ambulance.  Then they took him to the hospital.  From the hospital they didn't even stay one day, then he was taken to the mortuary.  They took him to Diepkloof mortuary.  Then he stayed there for two weeks.\n Then he was saying he was carrying two petrol bombs.  \nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 R MAPOGO\nThen they said this person is not a fighting person.  Then he doesn't like things.  Then they were thinking that he has petrol bombs.  Then we left with my aunt to look for his papers. \n On the third week they came from Diepkloof mortuary, then they wanted us to identify the corpse. Then we were able to identify the corpse.  Then they gave us his clothes.  Then we came back home. \n On the 21st of March we buried our uncle.  \n After that, on the 8th of March we were taken to Johannesburg ANC headquarters, where we filled in the forms, but we do not understand what was happening, because I did not understand.  Then we returned home.  We left those forms there.  Then we went back home. \n After that the person who was coming to us was Mr Morris, who used to come to tell us the process and the procedure of the whole thing.   They haven't come through.",

            "Rebecca, and your auntie, you know sometimes we are lost for words when we hear the stories that people tell us. I must say I am lost for words right now, because here was a man who was doing his work, who had his job, who was  on his way home, supporting his family, and people shoot at him.  Then they actually say that they were not sure whether they would be able to shoot at a person. There are so many of these stories of what happened in our country, and even in these last few days, as we have heard, the stories from different townships in this, what I call the circle, the old Western Transvaal area, undoubtedly there were young people, there were elderly people like your uncle, who were either tortured or in your uncle's case, killed.  We need to find some answers.\n In many ways, I think one of my fellow Commissioners, Ms Sooka, said yesterday that the very people who are meant to be the custodians of our safety, appear to be implicated in what was going on.  \n Her appeal and my appeal, of course today, is that we need to listen from their side, so that this truth that we talk about, can be laid open and we can understand what happened from both sides. \n I thank you very much for coming and you will be hearing from us again.  Thank you very much.\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG",
