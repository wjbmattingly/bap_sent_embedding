We sent our child to Cape Town to do the   junior certificate together with the senior.  That was in 1972.\n During the holidays he used to come back home.  But at the end of 1975 he did not report back home.  We phoned over to Hewton University.  The headmaster at Hewton told us that they are not there, that they have left college earlier after the winter holidays.  After the winter holidays.  That was in November when we are making the enquiries.  The headmaster told us that they are not at school, they left school earlier of that holidays.  From reliable sources they had crossed the border into Botswana.   Well, we tried to find out from all other directions, we couldn't find anything.   \n We started getting police coming to our place.  They wanted to know where was our son.  We told them that we don't know, he is missing as from college.  But they told us that we have got to know where the boy is.  \n But after a long time, not knowing where the boy is, being harassed by the police.  In church they would take us out to the house to come and search the house.  But they found nothing. \n It was only in 1985, I think when we were told that our KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 MR MAJOVA\nson is somewhere out in Tanganyika.  We tried to find out how can we get this boy back, but we could not find ways of getting in.\n In 1991 there was a call from somewhere that we must get to Krugersdorp, a place called Kagiso and look there is a library.  In front of the library there is a plaque there and the name of my boy is there.  We went there with my wife and we saw the plaque with the names.  The name of my son was also there.\n Not knowing who wrote the names there, and who put the plaque there, and after reading what was written there, we went to the police.  Because they are not very far from the library.  They referred us to Rustenberg to a place called Thabani.  When we reached Thabani, at the police station, we wanted to find out about the boys.  \n They took their books and went through the books.  They found one book with their names in.  It was written in inquest 13/1985.  It was 1985.12.28.  The names there were four. My boy's name was also there.  We wanted to find out where they were buried. They told us that it was SAFFAS was responsible for that.  We went there.  They only said they had buried them. We did not get the place where they were buried.  Up to today we have not had anybody telling us where the graves are.  \n We will be very grateful if you could get that grave.",

What amazes me is that you look so normal and when you speak it doesn't seem unusual for you, you just mention that, you\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n11 MR MAJOVA\njust say \"I was harassed\", and it is only when Commissioner Sooka tried to find out what the form of harassment is, that you mention that you were in fact tortured.  You haven't mentioned this as being extraordinary.  I myself and I think of all us kept saying that our country is in fact an extraordinary country, that it can have people like yourselves, people who can remain whole, despite this deep pain. I mean, it is not only that you lost a son, you don't know where your son is buried and you have had to run around trying to find out the truth and you still haven't really got the truth and you are hoping that the Commission may be able to assist you.  But we just want to say we thank God for people like you, that you haven't gone mad.  You have not even said here, I mean, all you are asking for, is to be able to find the remains of your son so that you can give him a proper burial. You have not spoken about anger. You have not spoken about taking revenge.  Maybe people in other communities get to take it too much for granted.  I want to say thank you, we want to say thank you to God for people like you, that we can have people who have suffered as much as you have suffered and that you do not seem to have a desire for revenge.  So we pray that God will continue to strengthen you and that God will help us in the Commission to find out the truth about your son, and that the one thing that you long for you may be able to give your son a decent burial.  Thank you.\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG",
