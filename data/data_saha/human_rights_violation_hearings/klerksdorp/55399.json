            "I am staying at Wolmaransstad, I am still\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 L MAHUMAPELO\nsaying there.  I am the second child of Susan Mosheshoe at Bothaville. I am the one who is looking after my parents because my family and my sister is married.  I am one of the activists at Wolmaransstad to see that change comes in our area and all over the country.  \n I would like to talk about my uncle who was shot by one of the policeman at Wolmaransstad.  It was during the water crisis at that time in Wolmaransstad in 1983. When there was a water problem we used to get water from the wells, which we made ourselves, in an area called Debing. As my uncle was one who was not working,  he was helping my grandmother to fetch water when we are at school.  Somewhere in February 1993 he went out with his friend to fetch water.  Nearby the Indian community there were some Whites who were understanding our problems at the location.  We did that.  With that water shortage problem - I don't remember the day well, but it was in February 1993, they went to fetch water there where we call it Debing.  It was roundabout six to seven, when it is not dusk and that is the time when many people used to go and fetch water there.  Whilst he was still out there he was shot behind his head,  by one of the policemen who was staying near Telkom where, nearer the place where we were fetching water, just next to our area.\n We heard the following day that my uncle has been shot at the police station.  We did not know when did it happen.  When the police came to tell us in the morning that our uncle was at the police station, we went there with some other family members to the police station to see whether that is true.  When we arrived there we found out that it is true.  He was there and he was shot and lying on the floor. Because that is the room where they used to put people who \nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 L MAHUMAPELO\nwas injured.  He was shot behind in the head. He did not go to the hospital. He did not go anywhere, he died the same day.  \n His case was heard in the magistrate's office because there was somebody who was with him on that day.  He was not able to be there because of work, because he was afraid that he may be retrenched.  So he was there to tell exactly what happened, so he was not able.\n In an investigation to try and find out who killed our uncle we didn't get any help.  The only help we got is that this case will begin after the funeral.  Then it started in 1994. Then there was only one court hearing.  Then they told us we will come and get the dates, about when are they going to proceed with the case.  Even up to now they have not yet proceeded with the case.  \n We, the family members, we ask ourselves so many questions, as to whether which kind of an institution which can defend the rights of people, they should have taken this case to court.  But we don't even get any notice or any letter to tell us what is happening.\n We followed that case.  When they see that we are persisting, they sent us a letter that we should come to listen to the hearings of the case in 1994.  When we listened to the proceedings, the same policeman who shot my uncle was not there.  So the case was postponed.  Even up to now we have not heard anything. \n It brings a lot of things within the family, because one of my grandmother is a person who is suffering from high blood, and she was admitted to hospital just about three weeks after the incident.  She stayed at the hospital for a week then she died, because of what has happened to her \nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 L MAHUMAPELO\nchild.  We buried her.  I think that is where I would put my statement.",
