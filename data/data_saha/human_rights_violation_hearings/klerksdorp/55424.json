            "On the 10th of May 1991 I was from the place of work, heading for my home.  I had a car that time. I parked my car close to a house and I went to see my friends. I came back very late from my friends. I didn't want to wake up my family because I knew my father would be angry with me. I decided to sleep in the car.  I said well, very early in the morning I will wake up and prepare myself for the next day.\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 S R PHIRI\nAt about four o'clock, as I was sleeping, I was nearly dreaming and I heard people speaking outside.  \n These people were speaking Afrikaans. As I was listening I could hear that these people were still standing where they were, and I thought maybe they were working at Ventersdorp High School. As I was listening to them, I heard Eugene Terre'blanche's voice.  He was giving them a command, and as to what should they do when they attack people.  After giving them those orders and commands, they came and I was just lying in the car, with eyes open, because I wanted to see what was going to happen.  \n They jumped into the yard and as I was listening they started attacking the house. I was in the car.  I couldn't then get out of the car.  After they attacked the house, they came out and they stood next to the car.  They smashed the back window.  The back window of the car and they came to the windscreen.  Because it was too hard, they hit it with a knobkierie twice and they were speaking and I could hear who they were.  Because the other one said Piet, this thing is too hard to crack, and Piet was giving him an answer and he said Koos, can you please stab the tyres.  As I was looking, Koos stabbed the - he punctured the tyres. I was so scared, I didn't know what was coming next.  I thought they would turn the car and burn it.  They just laughed and they jumped over the fence and they went into the veld shouting \"AWB, AWB\". \n I got out of the car as soon as they were gone and I got into the house.  Everything was not in an ordinary order, and I wanted to see members of my family.  I couldn't see them, because they were under the furniture that was lying all over.  I saw drops of blood and I followed these\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 S R PHIRI\ndrops of blood until I was in the street. I saw my mother lying and her head was injured, her whole body was also injured.  I picked her up.  I took her back into the house. My hands were full of her blood. \n The police came at about six o'clock.  On their arrival I requested them to take them to the hospital.  They didn't help us.  They said we should come and report at about two o'clock so that they can take our statements.  \n The local ANC people came home and they called their Klerksdorp office and from Klerksdorp a car was brought to transport them to Klerksdorp Hospital.  We cleaned the house and we reorganised everything in the house and thereafter we went to the police station to give our statements.\n But before we could give the statements, the police were teasing us, telling us that we are the squatters and they cannot just go out of their way to help the squatters.  I went to David Sigotho who was a CID at Klerksdorp. He welcome me and I gave him my statement.  After those few days, it was on a Monday, I heard that the AWB men have been arrested. On Tuesday they were released on R50,00 bail.   After two weeks I went back to the police station. I wanted to know what was going to happen to the damage we suffered.  The police said to me they do not have any help of any kind and what we should do, we should get ourselves private attorneys.  That was when we gave our statement to the Truth Commission, because we are lost.  We don't know what to do and where to go.",
