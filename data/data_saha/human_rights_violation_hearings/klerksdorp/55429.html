<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Thank you, Mrs Siko.  Are you a member of any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> No, I do not belong to any political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Can you explain to us what happened to you on that night of the 11th of May 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Before the 11th, it was in 1990, on the 16th of December, there were people who were staying at municipal's place, we were working at municipal's work. They bought them houses to stay there.  Then on the 16th the boers said to them they should leave to look for their place.  Because they were saying there are people who just stay there.  Those who are not supposed to be there should leave. Then these people went to the office to ask for a site, for sites to Mr Salty Visser.  When they arrived there he said to them he has no place, he has not yet allocated sites.  Then I, I was on the list, then the location was Kayeletu.  Then I was on the last street.  People, those people stayed there and they went to ANC members to look for sites from them.  These people took them and put them just next to me. It was on the road, and they put them on the other road.  When I knocked off from work, then I saw people moving.  My husband and my cousin hired a van.  Then they asked them to be together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a> When I arrived the municipal White workers were on a white van and hiding themselves.  When I arrived at them they said to me I should not tell anybody that they have seen me.  I agreed. Then when I arrived at home this van </p>

<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>2 E SIKO</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>arrived also.  Then I brought my next-door's furniture. Then I told wife, my husband and said those White people said I should not tell anybody.  Then I told my cousin that he should wait until these White people leave, then he should not tell people, then I am going to cook food for you to eat.  My cousin said I am not able to take the furniture.  Then they were using the wheelbarrows. </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a> Then after Christmas, it was in 1991, we stayed there, it was January, February, March, April.  Then during May, on the 7th, they entered.  They were putting the axes. It was on a Tuesday.  Then I asked Mrs Pulema's where are the people putting the axes?  They were saying they wanted to bring the dust bins. So I said that's okay.  When the axes were put in, they were put in by Gosimang, who was working in the municipal offices.  They were put in on Tuesday. On Wednesday they were writing names of people for the houses with axes, they were saying how many people are there in the houses, how many men, how many boys, how many girls.  This next-door neighbour of mine would say I am scared, because they are asking how many boys are staying in the house.  Maybe they were saying they are coming to help us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a> On Thursday it was Pentecost.  I was from work and then my mistress brought me home.  Then there were so many houses, they were writing on a board, writing AWB. I didn't understand that these people would assault.  But they went to Skietbaan and then my mistress asked that we should pass through. Then they - on Friday, I went to work. I came back from work. Then I slept. It was at daybreak at about quarter to five. I could hear some sounds on the roof.  I was sleeping with my child who is five years.  My husband was not there.  Then other people were sleeping in the other </p>

<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>3 E SIKO</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>shack house next-door.  Then I looked and said what's that.  They were throwing tear-gas, and when they looked I could see that there are clouds.  Then I said no, it is rain, sleep well.   When I said it is rain, I could feel the sound hitting on the door.  Then I stood up and shouted who are you, because I was surprised to see this person is kicking the door. They were axing the door.  They were saying AWB, we have no place here, this is our place, this is our place for our nation.  Then I said, please "baas", I didn't put myself here, but somebody sent me to stay here.  Then they hit me with a brick.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Take your time, all right.  Can you please give the lady some water to drink, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> And this child of mine was holding me tightly.  Then I covered him with my hands.  They were hitting me from the bed, then I hit the wardrobe.  Because I was saying I am paying here, what is the problem.  They said to me this is not my place.  Then I said I have the number.  Then I said it is No 11.  Then this Kosimang, they light with the torch.  Then the other one pulled a knife.  Then when he held the knife, I fell on my baby, because I said please don't kill me, who is going to take care of my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a> Then I knelt down.  Then I thought he was going to stab me at the back of my neck.  Then I just said I will just hear where he is going to stab me. Then at the time when he was stabbing, he was stabbing me on the waist.  Then he stabbed me with the knife. I could feel it when it went out.  Then Salty said I brought you here with whom.  Then I said "baas" Salty, I am paying here.  Then he pulled the knife off again.   They stabbed my child on the right leg.  Then they cut off the veins at the back.  Then she said they have KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>4 E SIKO</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>stabbed me. Then I said just keep quiet. Then he said please keep quiet, you can see how Whites are in here.  Then they were stabbing.  The clothes I was wearing at that time had eight holes.  Then they took the brick and hit me again.  I wanted to see this Black person who was with them.  Then I looked. Then they hit me on the head.  Then my daughter fainted.  Salty then said to me I told you not to be lenient with these people, you should have killed them.  They went out, they said sorry, we were at the wrong number.  As they left I followed them, carrying my child in my hands and I didn't realise that the time that Tomilos' legs were stabbed and the muscle was cut off.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a> I went to the next-door neighbour to call the boys.  I asked them where are you.  they said we are here. I said aren't you injured?  They said no, we are fine. I said please go and call a nurse called Koba to come with a Kombi to take my child to the hospital.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a> When they left they were not running. They didn't have guns with them.  They had knives and plastic batons and they jumped into the next-door shack.    I was still shouting, crying for help. I said people, come and help me, the Whites have killed my child.  I sent my son to the office, that is the child who came back with the police and they took me to their office.  They applied their first-aid and they stitched my child.  They didn't stop the blood that was flowing.  They couldn't even stitch me properly.  They didn't even give us an injection.  (Indistinct) and Johnny were the people taking my statement. I said to them the White people assaulted us.  They said you are lying, where do the Whites come from?  It is the comrades who assaulted you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a> I was taken to the hospital by my in-laws, telling me </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>6 E SIKO</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>that the blood doesn't want to stop flowing.  Then we should better go to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a> David Letgoto, who is the CID said they had better take me to Motala and Motala would take me to the hospital.  My father took me to Van Rensburg and Van Rensburg didn't want to examine me.  He said I am going to inject her with a fatal injection and my in-law requested Sister Koba to come and pick me up, to transport me to Sepong Hospital.   When I was released from the hospital, I was given the documents.  You know I couldn't stand for quite a long time because of my leg. I have been for treatment now and then.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a> I went to Mogorosi to enquire about the statement I gave them. I told them I am injured and my child was still very little and was also injured, what should I do.  They said nothing, we do not know.  After a week of my discharge from the hospital, a clerk from Ventersdorp, Herman told me to come to town and that he is going to give me R17 000,00.  I should go to town, I will see a grey Cressida and I should come with him to the park. I said to him I cannot walk.  He said try all the means you have, because I want to help you.  I was so scared and I thought he would kill me. I didn't go.   The policeman who took the statement from me, never came to me, even if I go to the police station, nobody gives me any attention.  And I was innocent. I will stop just there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you, Mrs Siko.  You told us how you recovered. Is your child all right as well?</p>

He is now a cripple.  Now my waist - at Klerksdorp they said the injection they have put in me is poisonous, and my waist KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>

<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> How old was your child at that time?  The one that was stabbed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> He was five years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Now I just want to understand.  You were already staying - what is this area called, sorry - we keep on talking about this area where you lived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> The place is called Khayeleto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Khayeleto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Is it still existing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> No, they have, all the people have been removed, it is now Extension 3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> How many people were staying there when this attack took place that night? How many families, how many homes were there already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> It was a location.  We hired it from the people, they took us from the people and gave us our own area, our own sites.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> You also mention in your statement, besides Mr Kosigomang, you mentioned Mr Visser who was the local clerk of the town.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Yes, that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Now you say in your statement that he too was present when the houses were attached.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> He was there, because he was saying they entered in the wrong number.  They could have got to the houses which have axes, but they went to my house which is No 11.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Are these two people still working for the local council?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>8 E SIKO</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Yes, they are still working at the municipal offices, and Visser is still there.  The person whom I don't understand is who is still working, is Simani.  So that office has been removed from the township to town.  So I am not sure whether he is still working for the municipality.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> In your statement you say that the perpetrators  were wearing military uniforms with an AWB emblem.  You saw that very clearly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Yes, I saw them clearly, they were dressed in brown trousers for soldiers and they had maroon badges.  They were having an eagle and even an eagle on their head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Did you recognise any of these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> I could only remember Salty Visser and I know th way he talks, because he is stammering all the time and then he is the one who says it is the wrong number, and Simon who said it is the wrong number.  Visser said he must not kill the children.  Then I was looking at him, then he hit me with something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you ma'am.  I just want to come to this question of this grey Cressida and R17 000,00.  You mentioned somebody's name in relationship to that.  What was the name that you mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> His name is Herman. I don't know whether this Herman is the surname or the name, because he was saying Mr Herman.  Then I could understand the person who is his domestic worker is Sophie Sauer, so it is the people who was able to identify him.  So he is no more there, he is now in the Cape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> So Sophie introduced you to Mr Herman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Yes, she can give a lot of information about this name Hermanm, as to whether it is a surname or it is just a</p>

<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>9 E SIKO</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>name, but they used to call him Herman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Now at the end of all this you did lay a charge at the police station. Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Yes, I went to the police station but nobody paid any attention to me.  As I was relating my story, they said go back to the township, your comrades assaulted you. I asked them which comrades, because Salty gave me that side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> And you heard nothing from them after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Nothing, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you very much, I have no further questions.  Prof Meiring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Just one question, Mrs Siko, and that is to do with the - you said there was a man, I think you said Dr Van Rensburg, who didn't want to treat you, and there was some mention of a fatal injection he wanted to give you.  Can you please repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> He said to my father - my father said to him I have a patient here and this person is weak, she cannot even stand on her own, and Van Rensburg gave him an answer.  He said we have given them the stitches, now what do they want here?  And he said to my father okay, just put her on the bed, I am going to give her a further injection to kill her.  And I didn't lie on the bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Do you think that was an attempt at a joke or was he serious in saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Van Rensburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> He wasn't making any jokes, because he was so angry when we went into his surgery.  He was angry as he was talking to my father.  My father tried to be a very humble man and he said I am not going to touch this girl, she was</p>

<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>10 E SIKO</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>assaulted by the comrades.  I said I was assaulted but Salty gave me the side.  He said lie on that bed, I will give you a fatal injection to kill you.  Then we just went back to the township and my mother-in-law requested Sister Koba to call the ANC people to transport me, and they came to transport me with my child to Sepong Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Was this Van Rensburg a medical doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Yes, he is now on pension.  He went on pension last year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you, no more questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mr Manthata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> If I understood you very well, you even tried to go to Motala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> No, no, we didn't try any attorney.  We didn't try any attorney. I went to the police station and I came back.  They didn't pay any attention to me. Even the statement-takers told me that there was nothing they knew and I didn't pursue this matter further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What is very surprising, is this issue of an attack on that night because some people in this area work, are employed by these attackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Yes, some of them are working for these attackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> In other words, the same employers were attacking the employees?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And they were the same people who transferred the assaulted people to Dr Van Rensburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Do you think there is a possibility of reconciliation with these people?</p>

<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> No, I don't think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Are they still present at Ventersdorp as we are talking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I thought you said one of them moved to Cape Town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SIKO:</span> Yes, Herman moved to Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I will ask you this question again.  Do you think these people are Christians, the AWB?</p>

<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>morning from Bloemhof, the statements from Coleni, you are from Ventersdorp.  There was the story of the lady whose school was bombed and again the possibility of the right-wing involvement was raised there.  As you know we have actually asked other political parties to come and make submissions to the Truth Commission.  Perhaps we should be asking the AWB as a movement and as a party to also come and talk about their involvement and their ideas of what was happening in that particular period.
