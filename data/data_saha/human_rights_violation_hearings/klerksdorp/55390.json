            "On that day it was a normal day. I woke up okay in the morning.  I didn't go out anywhere. I was just around in the township, not far from home. But early in the morning I was busy in the yard.  I went to pick up my friend. I was doing gardening in the morning until around twelve o'clock.  It happened, this thing happened round about three o'clock, it was a Wednesday.  That's why I was doing the rest of the day.  It was not even studying that part of the morning. We were just outside in the garden.  It was the time when my friend was at the back of the yard.  He was not aware where I was.  It was hot that day.  Then I decided just to pack up the instruments that I was using, so that I will complete my work in the late afternoon or maybe tomorrow morning.\n Then I heard gun shots from the back.  I didn't know what is happening, but I could hear the bang.  Then I turned around and looked behind me, trying to balance with my left leg.  I didn't realise that it didn't have strength. Then I wanted to fall down, but my head was a little bit down. I could see two policemen, White policemen, the one was a little bit hefty, the other one was lean.   When I turned around, suddenly I heard other shots.  They were not the same number of shots as before.  Then I fell down.  After that I became conscious in hospital, in the intensive care unit.  Then the sisters told me what happened to me. \n The sisters told me that they are going to do this and that.  My body is scrap, it is not the same as before, the whole body.  Those people who were shooting me, I don't know them. I am not able to identify them.  They said they have arrived at the hospital. I did not know what they were going to do at the hospital, but I was in the ICU.  During that \nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 S J BELAWENI\ntime, I think I stayed from the 5th of March, I think about two weeks.  Because I was discharged on the 5th of May. \n I didn't hear anything about the police, until when I was discharged from hospital. I decided to take some steps to lay a charge against them. It was then that I heard about them. It was somewhere in September.\n When they came to me they were very humble, you know, with me.  They didn't ill treat me at that time.  But they took me to the police station because I have a case against them.  They must make their statements against me also.  I gave them a statement. I accompanied them to Stilfontein police station.  When I arrived at Stilfontein police station, I realised that I am arrested.  Then one policeman told me that no, that the statement that we are taking now, you are now arrested and the reason is that you have laid a charge against us.  Then that was all, I was arrested.\n The following day I was released on R200,00 bail.  I did appear in court.  Lastly, I was outside when the court proceedings went on. I was sentenced on the 20th of June.  I was sentenced, I was convicted for public violence and I was sentenced to two years.  I made an appeal. I was not successful. The appeal was dismissed.  \n I tried to enquire about my case, my charge, because the first thing which I laid a charge against is the first one.  Then they said your case we don't know it, where it ended.  I was asking in court but I had to serve a sentence.  I went to Boergroep, to serve my sentence there.  I was released from prison in 1989.\n I made some attempts to meet the Human Rights lawyers.  Those lawyers told me that my case, according to them, if they look deeply into it, it doesn't show that it has been \nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 S J BELAWENI\ncompleted legally. Then there is no way they can get it right.  There were lawyers again which I was using, so those lawyers were referred to.  So they said they (indistinct), and so they could see that they were defeated, so there is nothing they can do further.    That's where my case has ended up till now.",
