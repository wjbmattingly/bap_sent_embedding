<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>3 K D MOTSAMAI</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>investigate to try to get that back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> My body has been affected because of electrocution and I am unable to work and I am getting a subsistence allowance from the Government.</p>

<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you, Mr Manthata.  Prof Meiring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Mr Motsamai, just a few questions.  You are 27 years old. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Are you married?</p>

<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> May I just come back to what Mr Manthata also asked about your work. Is it totally impossible for you to do any work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> It is totally impossible, because I am undergoing treatment every month. Then I get injections and I am giving pills and monthly I get that subsistence allowance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Where do you get that treatment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> At the Commissioner, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Is that at a hospital or at a clinic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> That is a clinic, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> It is a clinic.  And is there a specific doctor that takes care of you, if we want to go and ask for your files?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes, Sir, there is a doctor.</p>

<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> And is that in Potchefstroom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes, Sir, it is Potchefstroom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you.  A last question.  When did you leave school, in which standard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> I left school when I was doing Std 3 in 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you Prof Meiring.  Daniel, I just want you to relax, you are looking too tense, okay?  Take your time in answering your questions.  We don't want to frighten you, there is nothing to be frightened about.  All right?  Good, that's better.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a> Daniel, I want to come back to 1985.  What was happening in Ikhutseng township? I mean you have mentioned in your statement that there was the burning of the Kamathlape hall.  What else was happening in Ikhutseng township at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> People were fighting and people were throwing cars with stones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> (Speaker's mike not on).</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> It was the comrades, they were fighting against the high rent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> So there was a rent increase, were there also local councillors in Ikhutseng that people were against?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes, Sir, there were councillors and people didn't want that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> So were there also attacks on houses of councillors and policemen at the time, and police women? I know it is a long time ago, but you can take your time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes, councillors' houses were attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> And you were 16 years old at the time. Is that KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>5 K D MOTSAMAI</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes.  Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> 1969?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes, that's true, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> So the police, when they arrested you,  they took you to the police station in Potchefstroom or in Ikhutseng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> In Potchefstroom, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> You mentioned the name of Pappa Kisibi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> As one of the people whom you recognised?  He was a policeman, was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes, he was a policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Were there any other policemen that you recognised that were involved in your torture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> I only remember Pappa Kisibi, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Now the torture period that you were subjected to, how long did that last for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> I was tortured for a long time.  They were beating me on the face and my face was swollen and I was electrocuted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> A long time, are you talking about hours or days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> I am talking about hours, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you.  Then during that time or even after the torture, did you ask to be see by a doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes, I saw a doctor thereafter, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Do you remember the name of the doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> The doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Do you remember the name of the doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes, I remember the doctor, Sir.</p>

<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>6 K D MOTSAMAI</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> What was his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Staftabu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Daniel, you say that you spent six months in jail. Now between the arrest that took place, were you first released and then you had to go through a court case or did they just throw you into prison after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> I was released, then I was taken to court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> How long were you out of prison for, between that first arrest and then the court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> I think it is four days, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Was the court case immediately after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes, there was a court case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> How many of you were charged in that court case?  Who was with you?  Were you the only one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> I was alone, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> And what was the charge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> The charge was to tell why that hall was burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> So you were found guilty of actually burning the hall or public violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> I was convicted for public violence, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Daniel, is there anything else you want to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> There is nothing I want to add, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Can I ask you one more question, or two more questions, actually.  The one is, were you a member of the Youth Congress at the time in Ikhutseng? I know you said you are a member of the ANC, were you also a member of the Youth Congress?  You said you were a comrade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes, I was a member of the Youth Congress, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Daniel, you talked earlier on with Mr Manthata</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>7 K D MOTSAMAI</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>and Prof Piet Meiring about the medical treatment that you are receiving on a monthly basis.  Can you please tell us a little bit more about this medical treatment. Is it for psychological, psychiatric problems?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> It is physical treatment and psychological treatment, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> After that time when you were actually tortured, have you had to spend time in hospital for these problems?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> I never slept in the hospital, but I went to the hospital later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> What did you spend time in hospital for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> For them, after the torture and electrocution, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I didn't know when I was talking with you, that maybe you were frightened.  Is that so?  Because I asked you in regard to the doctor.  That after the torture, did you go to the doctor.  Then you said no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> I didn't go immediately.  I sat for some days and then thereafter I went to the doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Then when I asked you who the doctor is, you couldn't remember the doctor, but now when Dr Randera asked you about the doctor, then you come with the name, then you said it is Thabo.  That is why I am asking you that if you were frightened when I was first talking to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> No,  I was not frightened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Did you just forget?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTSAMAI:</span> Yes, I just forgot some other issues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Daniel, I would like to thank you for coming here today.  We have listened to your story.  We - I would</p>
