            "In 1986 it was on the 28th of February, it was about ten to eleven.  I left home in the direction of Krugersdorp. When I found police vans on the street. On that day it was the day of the rent boycott.  The policemen were on top of the vans, they were busy shooting.  I was shot but  I couldn't fall at the same time.  I walked until I arrived at the place where I was going and I fell on the verandah.  People were closing their doors.  I was hit by six bullets, three rubber bullets.  When I was on the verandah three policemen came, Mr De Kock, the other one is Joe Sabatti and then the other one is April.  They found me on the verandah. When people were shouting that there is no ambulance that\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 MRS M M THULO\ncan take me to the hospital, it is a dog that has died.    My sister was called and she came with a certain man called Mosebi. They picked me up before the policemen and they took me home.  When I arrived at home, they found a Kombi.  The owner is Malibu and then we were taken to the hospital quickly.  \n When we arrived at the hospital I slept seven days. On the eighth day I was not healed yet.  In the morning at about half past five those nurses going off from night shift knocked off at seven o'clock. They came to report to me that people were looking for me during the night and there were policemen and they asked me that when my doctor comes I should ask for a discharge. I asked for a discharge, even before I was healed. Then I left and went home.  My mother was ill and then asked me to take her to Dubateng.  When I arrived at Dubateng, the police were coming even during the night. I was staying at 16/31.  I stayed there three days.   On the third day the police van came. It was about six pm.  When they arrived I was able to identify one policeman among them. I was in the sitting room where I was sleeping.  They said there are people looking for you outside.  Then when I was in the kitchen I could see three policemen. I couldn't identify the two and then the third one, I knew him, it is Mr Raklocho.   He said they are coming to look for me. I said I am not going anywhere, you have shot me, you can finish me.  If you are supposed to take me to the prison, I don't understand.  That Raklocho, they turned back and left.   \n During the night I went somewhere to sleep,  so that the following day I should go back home, so that they should come to pick me up, they should pick me up before my mother.  KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 MRS M M THULO\nThat's when I went home. The police were coming during the night. Then I just said it is okay if they come and pick me up before you. \n Since then they didn't come again.",
