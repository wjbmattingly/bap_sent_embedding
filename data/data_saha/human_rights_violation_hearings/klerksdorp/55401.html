<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> I am not working, I am at home.              MR MANTHATA:  In other words, they are working for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> Yes, they are working and I also get a pension.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Just tell us briefly about this day when your house was attacked by White people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> We were told it was the White people wearing the soldiers' camouflage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Did you know the political party they belonged to, as they were wearing their uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> I only saw their uniform, they were wearing boots and as I was to be out of my house, they were already present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What did they do to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> They assaulted me and I went unconscious. As I was unconscious they surrounded my house.  I don't know how did I get to the hospital, but when I woke up, I was at the hospital and I had three wounds on my head. I regained</p>

<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>3 N W MANGWELE</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>consciousness in the hospital. In the morning I realised I was in hospital and I asked these women who are working at the hospital what happened. They said no, the police van brought you here.  The clothes that I was wearing was full of blood.  The bed I was lying on, was full of blood. The blood just couldn't stop flowing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> When you regained consciousness at the hospital, what did they say to you about the children that were with you in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> It was myself and two daughters.  The other one managed to escape, but the little one couldnt' wake up because she is so fond of sleeping, and she only managed to run underneath the bed. But the bed was fully packed underneath and she forced her way through and they couldn't see her, as they were unpacking everything underneath the bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What was the condition of the house?  Did they burn it, did they destroy the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> They destroyed my furniture, the doors were broken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Where were the boys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> The boys were not present, they were scattered as they were working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And as they were coming to see you at the hospital, did they say anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> Are you referring to my boys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Yes, the boys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> They came to see me at home, after being discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And what did they say about your assault? Didn't they say anything about the police, didn't they talk</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>4 N W MANGWELE</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>about laying a charge against the people who assaulted you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> No, they didn't say anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What made them to be quiet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> I will not be in a position to know, because I was injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I am saying, were they shocked or did they take it as a common practice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You only know that they kept quiet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Were nearby families also attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> Yes, they were attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And did you come together as families that have been attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> Yes, we came together and the ANC branch at Klerksdorp came to see us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What did the ANC say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> They were taking statements and they left.  They said they would come back, but up to this day they never came back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> How do you feel now towards the boers who attacked you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> I do not know what to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I am saying do you think there is still that fear that they would attack you any time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> Because this incident took place in 1991, where we thought that White people would attack Black people any more.  We spent sleepless nights because we think, we feel, we are scared they will come and kill us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What should be done really?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> I do not know what should be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>5 N W MANGWELE</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> As a group living in that area, living in fear, don't you have ideas, maybe that would help you overcome this problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> I think prayer is the solution, we should just pray, we should say God help us!</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> With regard to the damage to your property, was there an estimation as to how much damage has been caused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> No, nobody gave us the estimations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You have been to the hospital.  How much did you spend to consult with the doctors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> I have been to doctors, government doctors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> How do you feel today?  Do you feel healthy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> No, every time when I get my pension I have to make a turn at the doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I thank you.  I will stop there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Prof Meiring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Just a short question.  I would like to ask about your children.  How are they after the attack, do they still suffer emotionally, do you have problems with the children or are they at peace after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> They are there, they are staying at their own places.  They come rarely at home.  They came last month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Mrs Mangwele, I don't have any questions for you.  Except to thank you for coming here today.  Before I make my closing remarks, would you like to say anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGWELE:</span> There is nothing I want to say further. I want them to pay me for the damage they have done to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Thank you, Mrs Mangwele.  Thank you.  Can we</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>6 N W MANGWELE</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>please settle down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a> Mrs Mangwele, you know about three or four weeks ago I sat as part of the panel listening to what happened in Boipatong, which is in the Vaal.   There people were not as fortunate, many people died on that night, when in that situation, it was a different group of people.  They happened to be Black in this situation, although it is not clear, it seems like most people have said, the people happen to have been White.  But what seems to have been common, is that these people were not concerned - I mean here you are. You ae not 68 years old.  At that time you were 63 years old.  This happened about five years ago.  But these people were not concerned whether they were attacking children, young people, elderly people. The question has to be asked: what manner of humankind is this, that go into other people's homes, attack them, sometimes kill people, sometimes cripple people, as has been mentioned here.  In your case also, your biggest concern, is the damage that was done to your property.  One can just hope and pray that these sort of events never take place again in our lifetime, and certainly in our country, and that you can find peace in this new South Africa that we have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a> I thank you for coming.</p>
