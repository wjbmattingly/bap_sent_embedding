            "I don't have a question, it is just a piece of information I want to share with you.  As we go around the country listening to the stories, in 1986 in this same year of 1986, people died in KwaNdebele, nine of them were killed.  That is why we are asking you about the leadership.  Did they give you the condition in the country at that time?  That was my statement, thank you.",

            "Thank you, Tom.  Mrs Sephapo, it remains for me to thank you for coming and to thank you for giving evidence, telling us what happened.  This was a particularly fateful day in Kanana as Dr Randera referred to earlier already.  That was also the same evening on which the son of Mr Khiba who testified earlier this year.  You have told us about at least three other persons that were killed, shot and killed, it would appear, together with your son.  So it seems to have been a particularly bad day in Kanana.  I must add that this kind of violation, civilians being shot and killed by members of the security forces, particularly the\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n7 S H SEPHAPO\npolice, is a very frequent and common occurrence, common type of case that the Commission deals with. One is over and over shocked by the senseless loss of life, and in some instances, and we heard a lot of testimony in this sitting, about what one can only describe as lawlessness on the part of police, particularly.  Now nothing that one can say can really compensate for the loss of life.  Particularly the loss of life of a child, a son.  We appreciate and we understand the grief that goes with that.  That one cannot really bring back the life.  But a lot of people sacrificed and sacrificed their lives.  It is perhaps a small consolation that all of those sacrifices have added up eventually to what we see unfolding today.  A promise of a better life, a promise of a better future, a promise of eventually a community free of conflict, free of violence. Perhaps it is a small consolation that your son has lost his life under those circumstances.  But we want to thank you for coming and sharing your story with us.  Go well.",
