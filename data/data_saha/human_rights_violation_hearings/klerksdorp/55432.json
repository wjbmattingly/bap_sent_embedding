            "In 1991, William Mateketa was working at Afrikanerweg No 22, very close to Klerksdorp. It was a place belonging to a certain Strydom.  At the end of the month my husband didn't get his salary as people were getting theirs. He enquired from this person why he doesn't get his salary.  The White man told him to be quiet and he ordered him to vacate the farm, otherwise he will call the police.  My husband didn't argue with him.  He was just surprised as to why he doesn't get his money.  He told me that his boss told him that he should leave the farm and then he is not going to be paid.\n He later went to see his friends.  As I was away, I was together with the children.  The last born was two months old and I heard a car coming.  I could see it was a blue car. It had a lamp on the top. I said this is a police car coming to our direction. It was driving at a very high speed. It stopped at the house.  Out of the car Willie Strydom, the owner of the farm, got out of the car, together with a White policeman and two White police women.  They asked me as to where William was.  I said I do not know.  This policeman said how come you do not know the whereabouts of your husband. I said he just left, he didn't tell me where he was going.  He said listen here, we do not want you on this farm before sunset, you should make it a point that you leave.  The same policeman was so angry he was insulting KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 I M TLWAELO\nme and he said to me we belong to Mandela and we must never think that we would be controlling things, even if Mandela was out.  He said we will listen to the others, we should go and tell Mandela to give us our own farms.  \n He was a sergeant.  He had this name tag on his name, and his surname was Wessels. It was just the surname. I didn't see the name.  He had a gun in his right hand and in the left hand he had a tear-gas canister. He said I can shoot you together with your children.  I said why?  He said you don't want to leave Strydom's farm.  I said we don't want to - it is not that we don't want to leave Strydom's farm, Strydom has to pay my husband.  Then he pulled out his gun and he pulled a shot.  He said consider yourself lucky, because you are carrying a child, otherwise I would have shot at you.  He grabbed me by my left hand and he said come on, take out your husband, you hid him in this house. \n Then the two police women came into the house with me.  We went straight to the bedroom.  Wessels was standing on the threshold of the door and he had this firearm and the tear-gas.  Willie Strydom, the owner of the farm, was at the door, leading to the outside.  The two - he also had a gun.  The two women were ordered by Sgt Wessels to search underneath the beds and they searched and they reported back that my husband is not anywhere in the house.  \n Wessels said to me tell your husband to vacate Strydom's farm before six o'clock.  After some minutes my husband arrived and I told him that the police were here, together with the owner of the farm and they told me to tell you that we should leave the farm before six o'clock.\n My husband said what are we going to do, because we \nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 I M TLWAELO\nhave a baby and it is dark.  The order from Strydom was that we shouldn't take anything with us, we shouldn't take our belongings, we should only leave with what we had on our bodies, that is the clothes.\n As we were planning how to leave this farm, time was going by.  At about something to six, we were not far from the road to Wolmaransstad, and as we were there we saw two police vans and the other two cars.  Their lights were on and they were facing our direction.  They shot.  I took my baby, I abba-ed the baby and we ran to Jouberton where the brother to my husband was staying. \n The next day we arrived here at Jouberton at about half past ten.  We didn't have any transport to transport us in time to Jouberton.  The next morning we wanted to take steps, you know, to report this matter to the police station.  When we arrived at the police station, the policeman in charge of the charge office, after hearing that we have brought this matter, and he indicated that an order was given out by Wessels that anyone who comes to lay charges with regard to Strydom's farm, shouldn't be listened to.  \n Until this day I have lost my belongings, my clothes, everything.  That is the end of the story.",
