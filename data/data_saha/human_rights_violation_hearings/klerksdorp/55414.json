I was standing at the gate with my mother and my sister.  Then after the lights were off, then we went into the house, then we slept.  There was no  problem.\n At about three o'clock in the morning one man entered the house with a White policeman.  When he entered he said he wants Kedibone.  My mother said here she is.  Then she lighted with a torch.  Then he told me that what did I do.  I said I did not do anything.  Then he said were you there when the youth were singing.  Then I said no, I was not there.  Then he said come, you will talk at the office.  Then they took me, they put me in the police car.  I didn't know who hit me on the head.  After I was hit they took me to the police off.  Thereafter they locked me up.  We were five ladies.  Thereafter they took us to the police station at Makwassie.  That is where we were interrogated.  They were hitting us with open hands.  \n What is painful is that we were beaten by Whites with balaclavas.

            "I just want to add to what Kedibone has just said.  These things happened a long time ago and I am a bit forgetful, but she told me about the torture at Stilfontein, how they were poured with water.  But there is another man called Thomas Mogatse of Makwassie who passed away.  He was not a policeman, he was just a worker.  But he was one of those people who was taken to point out our children. I was so scared of the police. I didn't want to say anything to the police. I just asked them what did she do.  I said to them she was not present as they were chanting songs, because I was scared, I thought they would hit us all in the house.  I don't want to say anything further, because she experienced the trouble from home to Stilfontein.  And I want to thank you.  And I want to thank you for your presence today.   We, for the first time we listen to\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n8 C K MORAKE\nourselves, but you know as I saw you, I got scared, because you know, we still have that legacy of being scared of people.  But I want to thank you that I took out this heavy burden.  May God empower you to help people in this country.  Thank you.",
