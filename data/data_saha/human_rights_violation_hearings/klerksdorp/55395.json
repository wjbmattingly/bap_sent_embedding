            "Thank you.  Thank you, Mrs Khiba, thank you for your testimony.  We hear quite a number of cases\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n8 M KHIBA\nrelating to disappearances.  It is the kind of case that presents a particular challenge to the Commission, because often it is very difficult to deal with a disappearance. Often it relates to an incident that happened some time back.  In your case your son has been missing for at least the past ten years.  That, of course, together with the scant information that one normally finds when we have to deal with cases of disappearance, puts a particular challenge to the Commission.\n However, because of the fact that the proceedings of this Commission is publicized very widely, there is always a prospect of some information being forthcoming.  Simply as a result of the fact that the proceedings itself is heard by many people, and a lot of people take note of it.\n We also understand the anguish that goes with a disappearance for the family. In your case, particularly, you didn't have a very easy life.  You are advanced in years.  So it must be very, very difficult for you even now, to deal with the uncertainty to know exactly what happened.  So we want to say to you that we do understand, and we feel with you.  We understand that anguish.\n We have noted what you have said, why you came here today, in an attempt to get assistance, in an attempt to try and find out what happened to your son. We have noted that. We will see what could be done about the matter, but as I have said earlier, it is normally a very difficult kind of case to deal with, because of the fact that there is normally very little information to go on.  But thank you once again for coming and good luck forward.  Thank you.\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG",
