After some few days we learnt that the child did not return back from that march.  We heard that people died at that march.  I was not in, around Transvaal, I was outside Soshanguve and Mamelodi.  I learned that this child died.  That is when we started looking for him with my father, but unfortunately we searched the boy for about 15, 19.\nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 G S MAKOLA",

So I think it was organised by the Civic and after that when they went there.  So my younger brother was visiting there the aunt.  Unfortunately, he joined the Comrades as usual.  Then after a few days we heard from the aunt that the boy did not return.  So we had a problem.  After that we went looking for him from police station to another police station.  Even at the Government Mortuary.  Unfortunately, we did not get him at the Government Mortuary.  So the search was for about 19 days.  So we went to the police station again, we went to the mortuary again.\n After 19 days we heard from rumours that they were buried somewhere.  So someone told us that, I am not quite sure about that one, but they said that, as rumours say, they were buried somewhere in Mamelodi at the base of the mountain.  So after 14 days, I mean 19 days, so we went back to the same mortuary, we went there, but fortunately enough, that time we got him.  So we questioned them what happened, why we came here for the first time, but they could not explain.  So as a Phillistus said and Mr Msiza said, we went to Pretoria North Court.  Unfortunately, everything was not gloomy during that time.  Otherwise even the lawyers of LR, LHR were a little bit jumpy when we asked them.  One of them said some funny stories about everything.  So I became disillusioned and went away and never went back to the same\nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 G S MAKOLA\ncourt.  Even today we are still waiting for these people to tell us what happened.  \n Now what is important today, I think, I am interested with the person who gave orders that day to mow people down and the other question I am asking is that why for 19 days we have been looking to and for, but we did not get the corpse of this young boy.",

You go to a police station, you go to a hospital, you got to a mortuary and things, you just do not seem to get to the bottom of things and we are very sorry, I mean, because that just adds to the pain that people were experiencing at the time because it would be far better to know as soon as you can the fate of your loved one.  It seems to have been an additional torture that was being inflicted on people that they did not know.  I mean often they were treated harshly.  If they were not two people they thought would provide them with information and so we will also try to find out why it was that it took 19 days that you went to the mortuary on the first occasion and 19 days later the corpse is in that same mortuary where originally you came away with empty hands, but we also just want to \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n8 G S MAKOLA\nexpress our sympathy as a Commission as I have tried to do with others of those who have been testifying.
