            "It was in 1986 during February on the tenth.  When I woke up that morning I was preparing myself to go to work.  I left my son washing himself.  He was preparing to go to school.  Then I left for work.  When I arrived at work, whilst busy with my work at about after 12 I received a telephone call at work.  They said I must leave work and go home because my child has passed away.  That shocked me.  What was wrong with him.  They told me to leave work and go home.\n We arrived at home, I arrived at home at about quarter past four.  It was true, he had passed away.  We have been questioning ourselves as to what happened.  It transpired that they left school, but forcefully so.  Instead of going home he did not.  They were around the streets and then someone in a car drove past by and then shot at them at random.  Unfortunately, he shot my son.  As he fell down some of them ran away.  He never knew what hit him.  After that white man passed they tried to wake him up, but they failed.  Then they tried to get him on a taxi for the hospital.  Then he passed away.\nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 P MOTHUPI\n The following day we went to the hospital to check on him.  We were informed that he did not sleep at the hospital, he was at the Government Mortuary.  We went to the Government Mortuary and then we found him there.  Well, it was evident that he had passed away.  I took his clothes, took them home.  I asked them if I could not take him today.  They said I must come and take him before that night.  So I tried to talk to the Commander so that we can take my son's body.  We went to the Government Mortuary demanding the corpse, so they refused.  They said he is still bleeding, they cannot release him to us.  I asked them, you said yesterday that we will pay him rent if he stays here, but they said to me I can leave, but they will keep on informing us as to when we come and collect the corpse.  \n After some days a white and a black man came to my place.  They said we have released the corpse so that you can have it at home, but he must not enter the yard.  He will be taken to Komanie's Mortuary.  They refused us to take him to our place.  Komanie came and take him to his mortuary, but he did tell me that I have your son's corpse.  I agreed that he must take the corpse to his mortuary.  I timeously went to Komanie's Mortuary to check on my son's corpse until they agreed that I must go and bury him.  That is what I can remember.",
