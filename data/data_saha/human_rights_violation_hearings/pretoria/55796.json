That bomb made a funny sound before it exploded and then I went to the kitchen door and opened it.  This thing started making a funny sound and exploded.  That is the bomb that they threw in through the bedroom window he was sleeping in.  He woke up and he ran into the dining room.  That is where I woke up and tried to go to his bedroom.  The other boys, that is Walter and Oupa, were sleeping in the dining room.  This one woke up and he ran to the dining room.\n When the other two woke up who were sleeping under the table in the dining room instead of running to the other side they went to the bedroom where the bomb was and these nails struck Walter and Oupa.  It was about two o' clock in \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 E LEDWABA\nthe morning.  The doors went flying and the roof also went flying because of the bullets that were being shot.  There was a bit of dust in the house and we were worried what was happening.  When I opened the doors there were many soldiers outside.  There were so many of them in my yard and they said to me, where are your children lady. I said which children of mine.  I said the children of yours who are having a bomb in the house and I said to them how can they sleep with a bomb whilst I am with them in the house.  I had not seen that bomb.  How can that happen and they said, yes, these children of yours are having a bomb in their possession.  There were many soldiers, that is white soldiers, there were no black soldiers at that time.  \n This boys room burned and we tried to fetch water and pour it over the wardrobe so that we can extinguish the fire.  We could not see each other in the house because there was a bit of dust in the house because my husband was deaf he woke up later whilst the soldiers were already full in the house.  When the neighbours tried to come in they refused them entry and they had parked their Hippos at the corner of the street so that no one could see them.  They took these children and they claimed that they had to go to the hospital.  When my son tried to take my children to the hospital the police, the soldiers refused and they said they are waiting for a police ambulance or a Hippo.  We waited from two o' clock and they came at six o' clock to pick up the children.  The window glasses was scattered all around the house.  \n When they come to pick up Walter with the Hippo at about six o' clock Walter died when he reached the hospital and this one I am remaining with is Oupa.  He has an injured PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 E LEDWABA\nleg, he has a zinc in his leg and his other arm is not functioning well also.  That is all I can say because I am being hurt by this when I am speaking at the moment.",
