After that police came to my house looking for him, where he is.  They use to come during the day and the night.  After some times they came, there were white policemen and black policemen.  I think the black policemen were two, Radebe and Sewn.  They said to me if you do not tell us the truth we are going to kill you and I said to them you can shoot me, I do not know where he is.  The following day in the morning Radebe came again and said we heard where your son is.  Your son is in Botswana.  We know that he left to Angola or Tanzania and I said I do not know where he is.  They asked me if I want him if and I said if you could bring him that.\n After that I received a telephone from Mabopane Police Station.  They said you said you wanted to know where your son is.  I went with one of my friends who is called Manley and they took me to the police station.  They told me that he is dead and he killed himself, he committed suicide.  They said he committed suicide.  I went to fetch him in Zeerust, in the mortuary in Zeerust.  They said I should wait for the police to come where those police were keeping him in the police station.  There is a police station which is between the border gate and Zeerust and then the police arrived in the mortuary.  Then they identified him in the mortuary shelves.  He was having some marks on his neck and even on his shoulders to show that, to indicate that he was assaulted when you hold him.  I asked them what is happening, what happened?  They said he committed suicide with his own shirt.  I said to them, but it looks like a \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 E Z SHANDU\nwire and then I asked them if they could take me to the place where he committed suicide.  Then they said the police who were there are not here, they are off duty.  I continued asking them and they said do not ask us many questions because we know nothing.  \n Then we took him from the mortuary.  We buried him.  These police were there at his funeral.  They wanted to hear what we were going to say and then we buried him.  After having buried him police use to come and harass me.  They asked med was your son a member of the ANC.  I said I do not know and they asked me, what about you, are you a member of the ANC?  I said I was a member of the ANC before it was banned, but now I am a church goer.  They asked me where are some of your children.  Then I said to them I do not know where my other daughter is.  Then the police said they do not know where she is.  That was the last time I gave the statement.",
