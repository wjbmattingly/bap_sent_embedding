            "It was Thursday.  I was with my brother and I do not remember well who was the other one.  We received a call and my aunt answered it.  She asked the person on the phone what was the problem and the name of our brother was Mpho and the person, my aunt asked if Mpho was shot and the person on the phone dropped the phone.  They did not tell my anything because I was very young.  I did not know what was happening.  What I heard was that Walter and his friend were from a movie and they were at the crossroads and they said two girls approached.  They were carrying groceries and some liquor.  They say Walter asked those girls where did they shop those groceries.  They say Walter took their chewing gum out of the girl's mouth and they started running away.  Walter and his friend followed the girl.  This girl who is standing, sitting next to me said to Walter they should not follow those girls because they ran into a policeman's house.  So they stood there.\n At that time Rambo took out a gun and shot my brother.  They wanted to run away, but he fell down.  Rambo pulled my brother and shot him again.  This time on his head and he \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 L T MOLEMA\nwas looking at him.  What is really, I mean, I am feeling a great pain because now I am thinking my brother would be alive here with us today.  One of his friends left that scene and went to my father's place of work at work to tell him about the incident.  My father went there and he wanted to find out what was going on.  They say after Rambo, the police guy, after he pulled my brother into his yard he took the petrol bomb outside his house and he put them next to my brother's corpse so that people could think my brother wanted to bomb his house, but actually they say he just shot my brother.  He did not want to do anything to his house.  My father went there and he wanted an explanation.  They explained to him what happened.  \n My brother's friends, the other Comrades, came the next morning and the police came.  They started chasing those friends outside our yard and they started beating those boys with their guns and they were badly injured.  They took some to the hospital.  On the day of the night vigil the police came back.  They started kicking the doors at our house and we ran away, all the family ran away.  We went into a house and locked the doors and they came through the front door.  They were together with the soldiers.  They kicked the door three times and the door fell down.  They came into the house and they started chasing away all the, even the elderly people who were on the yard coming to help preparing for the funeral.  They told my father that they only wanted 50 people to attend the funeral and he told them it was impossible.  He wanted everyone who wants to come and bury his child to come there.  There were other boys who hid themselves in the ceiling of our house.  There were other boys who wanted to come and give the speech at the funeral, \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 L T MOLEMA\nbut they left the place.  I think those guys were terrorists, but I did not know at the time.  The police went away and on the day of the funeral at the Church they came again and started talking with the loudspeaker and they asked why are people so full at the funeral?  Is it the President's kid who is being buried.  So we went to the funeral and they blocked us on the road.  Other kids were travelling by bus and they were on top of the bus and they stopped the traffic.  They wanted to know what were those kids doing.  They told them to go back into their transport and they left us to proceed.  People could not have lunch at the funeral because it was very confusing.  They, everyone was confused.  \n After two weeks after the funeral my father went to his brother's place and they met this police guy who shot into the air and my father ran away with his brother, but after that incident the police never came back.  That was the last time I saw them harassing us.  I have had a lot of pain because in 1984 I lost my mother and we felt such great pain because my brother shortly afterwards, we lost him, and then my father had a stroke.  He cannot talk well, he cannot speak well.  Everything, he has to be assisted.  I am taking care of my father now.  We are only two in our house.  I am suffering and I am still young and I am suffering.  We lost family members.  I grew up well just like any other kid who had a normal family, but after I lost my mother and my brother I could not enjoy, I could not live well because I did not know, grow up to know my brother well and my mother well and now my father is very sick.  \n I am now thinking that if it was not for Rambo, that police guy who shot my brother, my father would be well now.  PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 L T MOLEMA\nI cannot even go to school because my father is not working now.  I am staying at home taking care of my father.  I am not enjoying this.",

A lot of these cases, like yours, are cases which we are continually investigating where we are trying to get some idea of what was actually happening, the context.  In this case you speak about a boycott, a liquor boycott, happening, that policemen were also being targeted, and it looks like this policeman who you mentioned with the nickname Rambo, was also involved, implicated in what was going on.  We are following up on all of those cases and on this particular case we will certainly be following up and we will be looking out to see if Rambo's name comes up in other contexts and, as I said to other witnesses, if there is a need to invite these people to come forward to explain their involvement, to give their side of what happened, we are certainly prepared to do that.  So your case along with all the other cases is certainly being followed up and investigated.  Thanks very much.  I know that you were very young when all of this happened.
