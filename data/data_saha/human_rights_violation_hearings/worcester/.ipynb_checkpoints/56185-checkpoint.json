            "[indistinct] to the Municipalities for supplying venues.  \n Before I introduce the team on my left and on my right, I just want to remind ourselves I suppose of the overall aims of the Commission.  A Commission which is dedicated to the search for truth in the hope of the contribution towards the reconciliation which we all long for and are working towards and have yet to realise fully in our country.\n One of the major aims of the Commission is to return to victims and survivors their civil and human rights which were taken away from them.  To restore to our country a moral order, to seek the truth and to make it known to the nation.  To create a culture of human rights and respect for the rule of law and in doing all of this, in the hope that we will never ever repeat some of the mistakes - the tragic mistakes we have made in the past.\n Some time ago I tried to put down on paper what my own personal hopes were for the Commission and I believe it is shared by the Commission itself and let me summarise in conclusion in this short introduction in putting it this way\nInstead of revenge -  their will be reconciliation.\nInstead of forgetfulness -  there will be knowledge and acknowledgement.\nInstead of rejection -  there will be acceptance by an compassionate state.\nInstead of violations of human rights -  there will be the restoration of a moral order and respect for the rule of law.\nThese are our aims and our hopes - you can make it possible by joining us in the quest. \nNow today we have on my left - far left Mr Denzil Potgieter - advocate Potgieter who is a Commissioner and a member of the Human Rights Violations Committee of the Commission.\nNext to me is Dr Wendy Orr who is a Commissioner and a member of the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee as well as being the convenor of the Western Cape, therefore she is our boss so we have to listen to her very carefully as we move on.  She will keep us in order I hope.\nOn my far right which is hardly appropriate is Mary Burton who is a Commissioner and she is a member of the Human Rights Violations Committee.\nPumla who is I think well known to many of you in this area and has certainly been a tower of strength as a Committee member of the Commission, a Committee member of the Human Rights Violations Committee and we are delighted that she is with us right next to me here as well.\nNow we will be receiving witnesses one at a time and they will be accompanied by what we call briefers.  It's an inadequate word.  It doesn't mean somebody who merely briefs another person - it is someone who cares for them - someone who is alongside them.  Someone who has been with them in the build up to today and will be with them during the hearing and after it as well.  So if you see somebody accompanying a witness you know that that person is somebody who is caring very specially for the witness for what can be quite a traumatic experience.\nOnce again you  are warmly welcome and I hand over now to Wendy Orr.",
