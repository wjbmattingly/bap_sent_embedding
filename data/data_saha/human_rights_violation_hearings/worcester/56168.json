It was around the same time 1985 in Zwelethemba, a time of State of Emergency, curfews -  the township being blockaded and intense police activity.\nCan you  tell us about the events which happened to you starting on that evening 12th October 1985?",

            "I will start by saying what  - I would start by stating on what happened on the 12th or I'll start the day before I was shot.\n There was a funeral in the location.  It was one of the comrades who was shot and dead, his name was Thomas Segolo.  So it was his funeral and it was on Friday.  The situation in the location was not stable.  There was a tense situation I would explain it that way.  The youth was not stable either.   More especially in the youth although it involved the whole community.  And then on Saturday there were protests among the location because as it was that tension people were not that much happy -  there were many things that happened as Mamma Bahume has stated before.  Some of the youth were shot dead and some were shot and injured.\nSo on the 12th of October I was also shot - the year was 1985 - it was a tar road where I was.  After the policemen shot me I was in someone else's yard,  I was visiting my friend called Zimphiwe - he was staying there.\nAfter that incident they beat me up, they were kicking me, insulting and assaulting us.  They dragged me, pulling me out of this yard  taking me into the police van.   What  I can state that not at that moment I was taken to hospital - I was bleeding heavily - I can't even mention how the way I was bleeding.  They couldn't even take the opportunity to take me to hospital, they were taking rounds around the location.  Sometimes they decided to stop their van chatting to each other, having that negotiations that I couldn't  understand and take their  exact meaning of what they were trying to say.\nThey used to use the torches to light me.  At times they used to point their guns at me,  so I don't know what was behind all this motion.  I knew - the  only thing I knew that they were the perpetrators, the culprits.  They can do anything because they've already shot me.\nAt a long last I thought they were bored - tired that's my thinking  they decided to something because at first I couldn't understand  why they did not take me to hospital.  They took me to Eben Donges Hospital.  I arrived at the hospital and they put me on a stretcher.  As I was laying there on that stretcher I was under police guard.  They asked me to wait there for an ambulance.  They told me that I would stay there for a long while because the ambulance were not around - hopefully they were busy in the location taking some others who were also shot.\nAt a long run an ambulance came - I asked for some water from the one of the guards - police guards and this police guard told me he is not allowed to give me water.  He was told not to give me anything.  After a while or after some time as the ambulance came it took me to Tygerberg Hospital.  It was around about in the morning or it was still midnight around ten.  Around about  6 o'clock I was taken to Tygerberg Hospital.  When we arrived there I was admitted.\nI  woke up in the morning and a  doctor woke me up - the time was around about 6.  I had a watch I believe so, it was still on my wrist.   I noticed that the time was 6 o'clock in the morning.    I was awoken by the doctor and he told me that I was badly injured and he told me that they would try their best as doctors.  They will try and examine me up to their utmost best.\nThey were going to take me to the X-ray first and they did as they say - as they said.  I was taken back to the ward again.  After a while - it was just a short period this doctor came back again and he told me that guy you are badly injured.  And we have noticed that there is nothing we can do about you.  The only thing we can do to you is to amputate your leg.  So that thing must be done as soon as possible.  Can you see the time now and I said yes, and he told me that around 10 this morning your leg must be amputated.  So the operation must be through already or else if we can wait up until ten - there is a possibility that you won't live, you can die.   Or else if you can take a risk and tell ourselves  that we would try our best and examine your leg and do all our best we can do to your leg, it will affect the whole body of yours and you will get sick.  \nI had no other option and I was forced and bound to accept the doctors perception.  I said if it's the way  you are telling me it's okay with me, I have no problem -   can you please bring me the forms - I will fill in the forms.  I filled them  and after that I told them that before you can  do anything can they do me a favour and phone my family at home because I find out that my parents are not aware of what's going on.\nI gave the doctor the phone number, my neighbours phone number and  I told him to try and phone my parents and he did so.  So my parents was the time they only get the message that I was in Tygerberg Hospital.  They were not aware all this time.   They even - they came as soon as they could.  They were not allowed to talk to me - they said they were not allowed so it was that situation - because it was time for me to go to the theatre.  They were told to come later.\nThe operation was done to me - my leg was amputated and it was okay - that was Sunday the day was the 13th October 1985.  I stayed there the whole - the whole day on Sunday under a drip.  And then on Monday, it was about lunch time at the hospital they brought me some food.  My face was swollen because the policemen had beaten me, had kicked me,  so that was the result of their assault and the way they dragged me from where I was lying in that yard.  It was very painful so it was - my swollen was resulted from that.\nI tried to walk slowly - I am sorry I tried to eat because I was very hungry I couldn't eat for the past two days.  This policemen forced me to eat because after you finish I am taking you - I can't remember whether I asked him whether - I asked him a question about where are we going to because I knew that I am going to the police cells.  And I had no option so I can't  even remember that I asked him a question.\nI try - I forced myself to eat.  After I finished my meal a nurse came along and brought me a wheelchair, took me from  the bed to the wheelchair - they brought two packets of pills, put them in my pocket.  By that time I was wearing - I would say it was a night gown -  a hospital night gown and then op top I had some - I had the other thing on top  like a gown.  There was nothing I had underneath, I had  no shoes on, no clothes on.  I had no idea what happened to my clothes but when I came into Worcester I heard that they had taken my clothes home.\nThey drove me out of the hospital - I was on the wheel chair, put me in the police van - I was operated yesterday,  remind you.

            "To me that situation is very unacceptable - I really can't describe and explain it, it was very painful - seemingly those days the system - the whole system of the country was corrupt -  upside down.  Because I don't think a qualified medical doctor could discharge a person from the situation I was  knowing that that person is being taken back to the police cells.\nWhat I was thinking of I thought that  I would stay there for about six months, I had no idea what happened to a person who has been amputated.  I thought I was going to stay there,  get proper medication and examination as someone who had an operation.  That's what I thought I was going to get.\nI am very painful and heartbroken because I just can't expressed my feelings of the situation that I was in that time.  Because I would say - I would say maybe I am inhuman because I don't think   that was not a professional doctor.  I think the professional doctor is the most person who could  care for a patient and he is the one who must care for you even from the police torture and all those things.  But that one discharged me.\nI went to Parow Police Station in Cape Town, that's where I realised that I will wait for policemen from Worcester.  I sat on a bench in the charge office.  I sat there for along time - there were people coming in and out and I was taken from there.  I was not given crutches to walk.  As I was taken from the wheelchair two people gave me support, take me into the van - police van -  even while  I was getting off in the  Parow police station I was given support by two people inside the police station.  So that showed me that - that I was careless - which shows that, that was not the right time for me to be discharged from the hospital.\nI was taken to the police cells telling me that I was waiting for the police from Worcester to take me back to Worcester.  I waited there for a long time.  They arrived there around about five.    They opened the cell and they woke me up because I was already asleep.  They told me that they are taking me and they said I must prepare myself we are on a journey.  There were two Coloured policemen - they supported me, taking me to the police van.\nThis police van - there were  two drivers who were wearing the camouflaged uniform.  They drove it as fast as they could.  The speed was very high - I can't even explain or describe - they were in such a hurry that they were driving at a very high speed.\nI was sitting on this - at the back of the van on those small benches that's where I was seated - with pains and in that terrible situation and with my leg that was amputated was so swollen - I couldn't stand even the pain.   As they were driving recklessly I was seated on the left side of the van.\nI couldn't tolerate the way they were driving because my leg was painful and the situation - I couldn't stand because there was also a wind that was blowing inside the van.  I could not bear the pain and I told myself - I tried to wave my hand to the police station and they stopped the van.  We were - we were just Paarl - it was just  a minute we passed Paarl and they stopped the van.  They get off, they came to me - they asked me what was my problem.\nI tried to plead with them and tell them my situation at the back of this car.  I tried to explain the pain I am having and the way they are driving -  can't they assist or help because I saw there was a space there were only two of them in front a third person could fit in there.  So I asked them can't they do me that favour.  They looked at each other, they nodded their heads, I think they had a little bit of humanity because they couldn't resist and they take me into the front seat.\nThey were supporting me to the front seat of the van.  As I was - as I was seated there I was - I felt much  comfortable  and I had to thank them a lot because I was relieved of the situation I was in at the back of the van, I thanked them a lot time and again and they drove off.\nWe arrived in Worcester.  As we were in the charge office that - the one here in Worcester, I think they even called those who were inexperienced to come and see this fool that was here because there were a lot of policemen by the time we arrived here,  even those that were not on duty, they came in.\nI was - they could - they had the guts to say anything that they can.  They told that this were the fruits of what you are doing in the location. The way you try to put the situation in the location - so they were saying things which one could not accept as a human being - terrible things that I couldn't even listen at because they were very terrible.\nI still remember one of the policeman saying to me you mustn't worry - your leg will grow again.  It was funny to me because I have never seen a leg growing again, seemingly he was very happy of what happened to me.  He kept on saying that thing time and again.  I accepted it at that moment although it was unacceptable because I can still remember they said it and it's still in my consciousness.",

I claimed against the State but that case couldn't go further  - I didn't succeed, which means I lost.\nThen the lawyers made an appeal again.  I think they saw there were chances that as I was acquitted from the original police at Worcester and the policemen acted unlawfully and the way I was treated I just can't accept it - I couldn't -  I can't understand, I can't even figure it out how did it happen and I was asked for two - I asked for two times about my claim as I was acquitted from the High Court in Worcester.  The first claim and the appeal were dismissed -  I think that was all of it.   \nAnd then last year what I would like to mention is I got a letter.  I would start from 1992.  Lawyers called me, they asked me to make an affidavit because that was what the State was asking for.  They wanted to be sure what am I doing at that moment - to state my state of income, how do I receive funds and I did that with the help of my lawyers.   I was still a student then and I sent the affidavit.\nAnd then last year round about August or September, I am not sure I received a letter from the State Attorney.  The State Attorney said the affidavit I made maybe was not but - was not exactly what they wanted but they said again that I must say the same thing that  I wrote there and then I did again write down the same thing that I did.\nBut last year I ignored the letter.   It came again, I received it later, the second one this year.  I read through it and it was saying the same thing and the lawyers phoned seemingly there were other lawyers now in that place, and they told me to make an affidavit because the State is asking for an affidavit to state my situation and my financial situation.",

And I tried to get private lawyers because I wanted to have someone - a legal person to help me to do the affidavit.  I tried to consult the lawyers - one of them was Ms Williams and I told them the whole situation and she said okay we will make the affidavit but we must open a file so - and I had to pay R200,00,  I've already paid R100,00 and I paid half of the amount.\nI told Ms Williams that on the financial situation I am not prepared to pay anything because this is too much even if it was not that because I am the loser because I lost my leg and then the next thing now the State demands a lot of money from me.   I am not prepared to pay it and I don't have means and I can't even afford to pay that amount because it is a huge amount for me to pay.\nBecause I felt that my human rights were violated and then at the end of the day I must pay the State some money.

And I am paying a very high cost and it is very expensive because I must go to Tygerberg Hospital from here to Tygerberg and I am - there are fees - I must pay - I paid R218,00 last year so I think that fee won't stay there, it will increase as time goes on.\nAt times I had to go to Red Cross, they had a prostheses department where I had to go and fit in the leg and then -  I am working here in Worcester but I have to travel all the long way to Cape Town.   I come back here, they phoned me again, I had to go back again to Cape Town, fit the leg again.  If it is not okay, I have to stay there for some days - maybe I will just make an example.\nIf I arrive in Cape Town Monday I must stay some days in Cape Town, I must ask for relief at work and stayed in Cape Town fitting the leg up until  it's okay, because it's a special treatment that I am getting.   \nI just can't stand that situation and I can't even manage to go through that process because at home I am the breadwinner at the moment.\nI don't know whether you will be able to do anything - to do, if you are able, I  will ask you to do something for me to solve my problem.",
