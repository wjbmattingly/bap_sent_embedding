When I was discharged I was informed that I would be taken to a place, but I could feel that I was not well yet.  You could see that the wounds were septic.  I made inquiries about why they could discharge me whilst I was still septic.  They stated that I would receive continuous treatment at the Out Patients Department in the clinic in my location.\nSo I used to go every day for treatment.  A van came and I was collected by the police,  and then I was taken to the police station here in town at  Worcester.  I could see that there were policemen around but there was one who was a Coloured.  He asked me whether I was under police guard in the hospital and I said yes.  He said I must not give this information to the Captain because I would be arrested again.\nWhen the Captain came in I was taken to him and he asked me the same question and I said no.   He didn't say anything further and then I was taken by the police in a van from Ashton was called telephonically.  After about 30 minutes the van came to take me.  Mr Dodson was the one who was driving the van.\nMr Dodson took me.  I had a letter from the hospital.  I did not know the contents of the letter because they just informed me that I should open it when the police wanted to arrest me.  Mr Dodson took me to Ashton,  I was at the back of the van.  I was informed to wait for Mr Joubert,  I waited for him.\nHe was the Captain during that time.  I waited for Mr Joubert outside the police station.  By the time he entered inside and he saw that it was a black person saying kaffers  you throwing stones and swear at me badly.\nAfter I heard that he was insulting me I gave him the letter that I was supposed to give him.  He opened this letter and read it through and then he swear at me again and then he told me to go - to go home, I am sorry to say so.\nI was taken by Mr Dodson and he informed me that he is  taking me home so I took my goods and go home.   When I arrived home I sat and rest.   After a month my mother took me to Mach that is lawyers in Montagu.   We went there and my mother told me that we were making a claim.\nWhen we arrived there he gave the statement as it - she  gave the statement as it is.  I didn't know what happened  I didn't  attend any Court.  It ended up by the time I was giving out the statement and my mother - there was nothing that was taken further.",

We thank you very much, because by the time you got shot you were still young  aged eleven and the words you passed to your family, those were also treated badly during that incident -  what and the fruits of the struggle that you were involved in -  it was painful -  it is  still painful and yet we thank you a lot.\nThe things that you are stating - putting forward to the  Commission, we will try our best to help and assist you.  Thank you very much, you may leave the stand. \nWe are going to mention how is the Truth Commission, the procedure of the Youth Commission.  People from rural areas do come forward and you give the statements to them.  It is not everybody who is giving out a statement, who will be able to come and witness for what to the Commission.\nWe are receiving a lot of statements.  There are many people all over the country who would like to come forward and witness what they saw.  We plead to you not to get bored or tired.  And you must not ignore the way we are treating this situation.  We are trying our best that in hearings like these we are trying to have as many examples as possible.\nLike for instance I would say, we don't like to show you that it's only the comrades who struggled during that time of the apartheid era.  Other people did also suffered.  We heard about necklacing???  we heard about white people who were also tortured so that people can know this Commission serve world-wide all over South Africa, that's how I can say it.\nAnd what we would like to achieve and say to the people we would to get a history of the incidents that happened as from 1960 up to 1993.  So we are pleading with you don't get a negative attitude if you didn't get your change to come to the witness stand or think that what you told us we would throw it in the dirty box.  No, it won't be like that, we will accept it, and keep it.\nEven your story will be in the report that will be given to the President of our country.  And if you find that you are the person who were  assaulted - heavily assaulted, everything that was going to be done to you if you did come to the stand or as you didn't come, we are still going to help you a lot and assist you and support you right through.  \nSomeone who may not have witnessed here should not consider that their written statement will be ignored.  This is not so, the written statement will be a  part of the eventful report to the President.  Even if you have only made a written statement and not a spoken witness, your notes will also be referred to the Committee of Reparations even if you did not appear before the Commission in person.\nSo don't loose your temper if we can't get you to come  and speak before us personally as if it's some new apartheid that only some people gets an opportunity to speak and others don't get an opportunity to speak.  Thank you very much.  \nXHOSA -",
