We are very pleased to  see you, we talked about age just now, and all I can say is without knowing how old you are, that you are a young man and in 1986 when the story begins of what happened to you, you must have been very-very young indeed and so it must have been particularly pain full and traumatic for you.\n We want you to feel comfortable where you are, even though it is quite a strain, to talk in front of so many people.  But you are part of the healing process, we need you to share with us your story so that other people can also be healed and so that this should never happen again.\n So feel confident that you have a contribution to make, but before you do so,  I would ask you to please stand so that you can take the oath.\nMZUKISI CATHNICK MDIDIMBA Duly sworn states",

            "We were at a funeral it was on the 24th May 1986 on Saturday.  We dispersed after the funeral, I went together with my uncle and we went to winery - from winery  we came back at 8.00 in the evening.  I  would like to explain that our location is just below and the town is up a bit.  \nWhen we went towards our location we could see that there was a smoke and the police searched when we met them and they said we must go further and then we went to our house.  I went to Zwelitsha that was where my uncle was staying.   We could  see that the neighbours house, it was Mr Gqoki, his house was burning.  After 8.00 we could hear sounds of cars, vans and  hippos and I heard people next door and there was insults also I could see that one of the neighbours was going passed it was Panie.\nI looked through the window, I could see that Mr Nkohliso was next door.  Panie kicked him and he shot this man who was lying on the ground. I was afraid and I closed the curtains and I was afraid that they would come for me.  We could see that it was door to door search, they were proceeding towards my house.   I requested that Konayisa should help me because she was on the double  bed and I wanted to get under the bed.\nAnd then I felt that my aunt would protect me. They got in and they asked where is Mathemba or Mzukisi, and he said he went out, they opened the wardrobes, they searched and when they didn't find me they said they will take my aunt, they couldn't hit my uncle because he was a cripple.\nAt the same they were hitting my uncle's wife and they grabbing, taking her along.  They locked the door and they went away with the key, I think it was about  12 or 1.00 am, I struggled to come out under the bed -  from under the bed.  \nI could hear a cry as I listened I could hear that it was my brother, I thought that every commotion has subsided I opened the door at the kitchen and tried to peep and  as I went out I could see that Matroos has also saw me,  and he started shouting and saying there is  Mzukisi.  They started chasing me because I ran out as soon as called out for the others.  \nThey started chasing me as I got to the junction next to Bogat's place,  there was - I could see another police van coming.   I ran to the van and I asked for protection.  Hanson came out and he just grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and he didn't say anything and then the people who were chasing took me from - he handed me over to them.  \nThey started hitting me with the sticks and the sjamboks.   I was assaulted for quite a long time, I was able to run away I was bleeding this time.  They started chasing me again and they were hitting me as I was having a big distance between them.  Unfortunately I slipped and then I fell on the ground.  When I was looking around I could see that Panie was already next to me I was afraid and then I ran again.  \nI felt that I should go directly to place so that even if I die I should die in front of my family.   I had to go past the house which was being burnt down a day before.  I couldn't see properly because the blood was just covering my eyes.  On my way back home I could see Mr Maya and the others,  and they started hitting me again. \nI felt that okay I should surrender and go to the police van,  I went there and I felt that it is safer in the van.  When I got there I found somebody who was already shot and who was also at the back of the van.  Panie came opened the door of the van, he grabbed me and pulled me out of the van.  They started assaulting me  again -  there was lot of them.  On my right knee dislocated and I felt that I was unconscious when I regained consciousness I could feel that they were hitting me on my testicles and one of my testicles ascended.  I was taken to the police cells at Robertson, the people who in the cell assisted me and they tried to replace the knee cap and also to pull the testicles so that they descend again. \nThere was lot of youths and then all of them were released I was the only one who was detained further.  I was together with the adult offenders.",

No Amnesty applications have been received yet.  Reports that Generals themselves have written to us,  are not correct and it is also incorrect that twenty  Generals are  involved.\nThe Commission will not at this stage provide any further details of the letter.  The lawyer who wrote to us have not yet had a reply whether the news emerged which we regret and we would prefer  to conduct discussions directly with lawyers and not through the media.\nWe are determined handle this matter carefully and correctly \nand we will of course be consulting with the Chairperson of the \nAmnesty Committee, Judge Hussan Mall.\nThe potential Amnesty applicants will be treated in the same \nway as any other Amnesty applicants namely in a \ndispassionate and even handed manner.
