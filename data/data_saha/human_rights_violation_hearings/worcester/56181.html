<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>Can I ask for some order before we start -  [indistinct]  - thank you very much.  Mr Opperman will you rather give you evidence in Afrikaans.  We welcome here is that Ms Opperman with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>Yes that is indeed  so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>Ms Opperman we welcome you here.  Just before you take your testimony Mr Opperman, we need you to   do the oath.  Would you please rise.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>KAREL JAKOBUS OPPERMAN Duly sworn states</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>Mr Opperman, your testimony also has to do with an event in Ashton that occurred during 1990 is that correct.  Would it be possible for you to tell us broadly what happened, who you are, where you live, what you personal circumstances are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>I am from Ashton.  My name of Karl Opperman.  I live in the location there.  I lost my eye because of events that I can't entirely remember on a particular day.  I suddenly felt a burning feeling in my eye when they shot at me and I ran into my house and I ran into the back of my yard so I could wash my face.  I then passed out at the back of my yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>I was then taken to hospital at the back of a bakkie and in Montagu I felt that I could not be helped, I had to go to the Tygerberg Hospital.  The ambulance then took me to the Tygerberg Hospital.   And at the hospital the police van saw me and then I was taken into the hospital and a women there through a coat over me but the policeman still followed me and then eventually the people who worked in the hospital said that a month earlier they were striking and if the police would not leave me alone, they would strike again.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>Mr Opperman sorry to interrupt you but would it be possible for you to speak slightly slower, the interpreters have some difficulty keeping up so that everyone will be able to understand you.  Would you please try and just speak a little slower - sorry for the interruption.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>Then I saw a doctor I asked for painkillers. I did not receive any painkillers. Then on the Sunday morning early a doctor came.  I then asked  the doctor whether I could first get some painkillers.  Then Gerry Johnson, a lawyer, came to see what  the circumstances were and then I asked the lawyer, Gerry Johnson, whether I could be placed under some sort of protection since the police continued to threaten me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>Then Gerry spoke to the doctor and asked the doctor to provide me with security staff which they did.  I then stayed in the hospital.  The problem that I have is that if my other eye gets damaged in future what will happen of me and my children.  I have heard nothing from the attorney that I have appointed.  This attorney just keeps telling that he will phone me again and then he never eventually phones me.  I do not know who to go to except this Truth Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>Is there anything else that you would like to add to your testimony before I ask you questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>No, you can ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>I want to go back to the event itself that you are giving testimony on where you were shot.  What day of the week was this?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>It was on such a day the 30 June 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>Where exactly did this occur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>It is exactly in the street where I live at the moment, in Bloekom Street, in Ashton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>What was the exact situation in Ashton at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>On that particular day there were women who marched from town and those people were locked up by the police.  But then it was very calm that afternoon in the location.  There was no indication that there was any kind of event going on at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>Do I understand you correctly, were there women who were locked up on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>This is true but  it was in the town itself that these women were locked up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>You said that these people were busy with a march.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>It was on the Saturday morning.  And these women were still locked up and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>was then shot between 2 and 3 o'clock in that afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>What was the reason for this march?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>I don't have any idea.   I do not know why this march happened.  It was very quite there in the location.  I was there in my yard.  I saw the police van and the next thing I saw I was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>What was the feeling of the community with regards to the women who were locked up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>There was no particular uproar in the location.  A lot of people tried to collect their families at the police station  and the people went and asked for their family members, but the location was very quite.  There was no particular uproar or noise or anything with regard to this event.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>The people were in the main road of the town.  The only people who were doing anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>Were the police driving around in the township in their police vans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>No, I did not see a  lot of police vans.  I only saw one police van and then I was shot.  It all happened very quickly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>Were you in the street when you were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>Yes, I was in the street.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>When you were shot, was there any sort of problem or uproar in the street itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>No, I  heard nothing, no noise, nothing that indicated that there was any sort of uproar or event taking account or unrest going on in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>Were you a member of any political organisation at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>You are a family man.  Where were you on your way that afternoon? </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>I was on the way from a friend's home.  I was walking up the hill towards my own home and then I was suddenly shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>Were there people meeting together there in your area when you were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>There were a couple of people sitting across the road but they were not doing anything particular that would have given an indication that there was unrest or anything else, just suddenly I  was - I  went to wash my face when I had this burning feeling in my face.  I noticed that there was blood.   And so then I was taken to the hospital in a bakkie after I had fainted  and I only recovered consciousness at the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>Were there any warnings before you were shot?</p>

<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>Who shot you do you think? </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>It was Roy and Braaff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>Are  these police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>Yes, they are two police officers from Ashton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>Would you think there was any reason why someone would shoot you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>No, I have had no argument with these people earlier.  I had no personal disagreement or any other reason why they should want to shoot me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>Due to this shooting incident you lost your left eye.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>For how long were you for treatment in the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>I initially went in for a week.  And I asked the hospital if he  could fix my eye up so that could continue to use it, but when I came back a week later, the doctor told me that  sadly he would have to remove my eye.  He was very unhappy about it and I was very unhappy about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>Did you have work at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>Yes I had work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>Would the loss of your eye have had any impact on your ability to work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>Yes, it was a difficult for me because I am a mechanic, I always work under cars and so on and I have had some consequences because of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>What was the state of your health before the incident.</p>

<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>No there was no particular reason  but I did suffer consequences from this event.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>How is your other eye at the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>I do not know what will happen to my eye in future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>How do you feel about the police officers who shot you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>We have never actually spoken to one another, we just avoid one another.  I try and avoid this person because I would not mind hurting this police officer myself. </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>Did you make any claims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>Yes, I made contact with an attorney, but this attorneys never comes back to me with regard to a possible claim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>Were you ever charged for doing something wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>No, when I left the hospital, a police officer tried to get a statement from me, but then Gerry Johnson, my attorney, told me to not give any statements to the police.  And then Father Wheeler was told to take me away.  He took me away to Cape Town.  And then I stayed with family members of mine in Cape Town for a week until Gerry  came and saw me there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>Do you have any children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>Yes, I have four children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>Does your wife have work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>Yes, she works.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>Are there any request you would like to direct to the Commission, Mr Opperman?  Is there any way in which you think that the Commission could particularly be of help to you?  Any particular way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>If I think about the future, if my other eye looses something.  How am I going to take care of my family.  Who will I be able to ask for help for my wife and children.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>What do you think will happen if you no longer able to work?  If your eye looses it's ability,  your remaining eye, what would happen to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>There is a lot one can say in this regard.  My children are used to receiving what they need, but if I eventually get in darkness, what will I be able to do for my children in the future.  These children will just see me as burden which will be unnecessary thing because of the work of someone else's hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>Thank you Mr Opperman.  I just want to hear if my colleague has any question.  Do you have any questions?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a> [indistinct] Chairperson - I just want to put things into perspective a bit.  But first I'd liked to say that it must be extremely difficult for you to suddenly loose sight or loose the use of one of your - of your eyes for nothing - which -for something which you do not understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>And it seems that you were not the only one who suffered the consequences of senseless shooting  in Ashton.  During the month of May and June through to July 1990,  which  is the year when you lost the use of your eye, there were a series of events in Ashton.  One of them was a march by women, both from Ou Kamp, the Coloured township and from Zolani.  Do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>Nee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>You do not know about that.  Do you know Mr Jakobus Daniels and Lukas Jantjies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>Nee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>They were residents in Ou Kamp who also got injuries and they did not know what was happening, like yourself.  Do you know Mr Jan Gertse?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>Jan Gertse?</p>

<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>I was already in hospital and then on either the Sunday or the Monday morning, he arrived in the hospital.  I am not exactly sure what happened myself that he landed up in hospital.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a> [indistinct] - but his condition now just in terms of his vision, what is his condition?</p>

<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>Is this about Jan Gertse death.  About  a year later Jan Gertse  was only burned up with his wife and children. </p>

<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a> [indistinct]  - there was a consumer boycott during May, that was launched in May, do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>MR OPPERMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>No.</p>

<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>We have information from our research department that during May there was a consumer boycott in Ashton which was joined by people from Ou Kamp and people from Zolani as well.  As result there was a lot of activity in Ashton and many conflicts between the police and the resident of Ou Kamp and Zolani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>I am just trying to understand why the police would be roaming about in the township and from what we have heard in our hearing since we started, there is - there are many stories from people who were shot under circumstances that they themselves could not explain, except to say that people - police were just shooting indiscriminately.  I am trying to place what happened to you in a context for us to understand the action of the police at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>You were shot by people for something that you knew nothing about but I would just like to explain to you that it seems from what we have heard from our research department that police were shooting around townships during that period and you were one of those people who were shot at, one of the victims of that senseless shooting that seems to have taken at the time, according to our research.</p>

<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>Thank you Pumla.  Mr Opperman you can take off the ear pieces.  We have listened to your testimony.  As my colleague indicated to you, our office has looked into the matter and has done their investigation of the circumstances in Ashton in that time and the various different meaningless, senseless activities that happened at that time.  It is very disquieting to listen to your testimony.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>You were just walking down the road, you did nothing wrong, suddenly you shot, it was a totally senseless act.  You lost your eye, you experienced the anxiety of a father and a breadwinner, a man who is worried that you might loose the use of your other eye and that you will just be in the way of other people, that you will be useless to them and a burden to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>We have many cases like this, that as my colleague pointed out to you, where we listened, specially people who lost their eyes, and where those people who were supposed to bring law and order, and those very people became a threat to the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>We have heard about the anxieties that you have mentioned to us.  The Commission has limited abilities, and within those limited abilities and with the limited resources  we have, we will try and see how we can help people.  We thank you for the time you have spent to come and tell your story for us.  We thank your wife for supporting you here and we hope that you will not come into the situation that you fear.  That you will turn out to be useless to your family because of the senseless acts of others and we wish you the very best.  Thank you.</p>
