You have been with us this morning and heard, as we have heard, a detailed explanation of the events leading up to the 13th November and then also of the Court case which followed but we want to hear today about your own personal experience of that time and I would like you to start on the 13th November 1985, the day that Lucas Jetta Sethwala was killed.  Tell us what you were doing on that day and then tell us how you were arrested and what happened to you during the Court case.  So it is up to you now. ",

            " On the 13th November I was present at the meeting and after the police shot tear gas at the crowd on the soccer field, I then just wanted to get home.  What happened later is that the police came to arrest us.  They had Casspirs vehicles there and we were loaded one on top of the other and we were taken to the Bantu Administration offices.  We were made to stand in a queue and we were told not to speak.  We were all handcuffed.  We were not allowed to ask for water.  We were just told to stay there but just before sunset we were released because the police weren't really sure what to do with us so we were released.  On the next day I went to work.  The Friday morning they came again and on the Monday I heard at Court that I was going to be detained for the murder of Jetta.  I think at that stage there were eight of us.  I was accused number six.  We were locked up and four months and three weeks and three days I spent in prison before being given bail.  I was arrested once again under the State of Emergency on the 17th June 1986 and I spent more than three months in prison before our case was heard.  The case took a very, very long time and we were eventually convicted.  The point I would like to make here is the following.  The reason why I am here is because the Court convicted me after I pleaded not guilty and I was not guilty.  The Court convicted me because I was a part of a group of people who had gathered in front of the house and who were stoning the house and that led to the policeman's death.  We called for reinforcements but the Judge was still not satisfied with it and he just continued with the case in his own way until he sentenced us to death.  What I would like the Commission's assistance with, is in respect of the four witnesses who identified me at the identification parade.  I would like these people to come to the Commission and tell the truth because during the Court case they told absolute lies.  They fabricated evidence against me.  I was innocent but my conscience bothers me on a daily basis.  I was put on death row without having committed any crime.  I also had dreams, I also had a job.  I supported my parents.  I was a breadwinner but look at me today and that is as a result of the four people who identified me and they know themselves that they were lying but here I sit as a result of their actions.",
