There were two and the others were chasing my friend.  They were beating me there.  They've beaten me enough, I was not able even to stand up and I had a terrible pain on my waist.  I was able to say I'm dying for something I don't know.  After I spoken that they left me and went away.  They were, they have beaten me thoroughly.  Even now my body is still painful.  Then I went home.  I didn't lay a charge, I didn't lay a charge with the police because I thought I'll be arrested if I can go and lay a charge.  Then I went to the doctor - I went to the doctor then even up till now, even when I'm sleeping at night I'm not sleeping peacefully.  Even before God I know that He is the one who knows everything.
