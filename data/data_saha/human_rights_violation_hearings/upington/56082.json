            "I, Mr Nicholas Makandile Links from Brown Street 572 in Paballelo at telephone 26425 (at my house).  My works telephone number 22792.  I was a municipal policeman during this incident.  I, my wife and child returned from church on the 31st December 1985.  While walking to our residence at 709 Brown Street, we could smell teargas.  At approximately five minutes past 12 on the 1st January 1986 we heard stones falling onto our roof. I then went out and saw four young males standing opposite my house.  When I approached them they fled and ran away.  I went back into my house and informed my wife to switch off all the lights and I hid my family in the lounge.  The same four young men returned to my house and threw my front windows broken.  I ran out again and fired two warning shots at the four young men.  They fled and returned a few minutes later and once again stoned the house.  I chased after them and shot one of the young men who had thrown at my house.  I then realised that I had killed this young boy.  I phoned the Paballelo police station twice to inform them that I had shot somebody.  The following policemen arrived in a casspir - Inspector Swanepoel, Fanie Burger and Tarrie Smith [Tarrie, Tarrie, that's correct] and Captain Botha.  Inspector Swanepoel congratulated me on my first murder but I was severely reprimanded by Captain Botha who called me a hoer kind and that I was a bad shot and I should have killed all four.  Captain Botha commanded Swanepoel to give me a shotgun with one hundred rounds of SSG ammunition.  Constable Ben Rabuthle was posted at my residence as a guard for the evening.  At approximately 0400 a.m. some children once again returned and stoned the house.  I informed my colleague not to shoot at the children but to fire in the air.  The next morning I was once again severely reprimanded by Captain Botha who accused me of being a bad policeman who wasted the goverment's money and that I was a bad shot.  I later discovered that the victim was Matan Jonga but I am not sure about his age.  I do not know who the others were.  I left the employ of the municipal police and went to Namibia where I stayed from 1986 till December 1991 when I returned to Upington.  When I came back the community accepted me back and I wish to apologise in public to the community and the victim's parents.  In September 1996 I went to the Station Commissioner to retrieve the inquest docket relating to the death of Matan Jonga.  I was told by the aforementioned that the inquest docket had already been destroyed.  To my knowledge this is contrary to the regulations because all documentation has to be kept for 15 years.  Approximately three weeks ago I saw documentation being destroyed by the police and I assume that it was as a result of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's investigator's pending visit to the police station.",

This is not the first time that we have been made aware of the terrible situation experienced by municipal policemen and people referred to as kitskonstabels stuck between the difficulties of their own communities and between the strong arm of the law.  It is my first experience of having somebody testify before us and make a public apology and I would like to thank you for that.  I would also like to ask you just for clarity sake, you said that the shredding of documents which you witnessed recently, took place three weeks before you made your statement to us.  I just want to know whether that statement was made now this week or whether it was made when our statement takers were in this area a week or so ago, just so we get the timing right?",

            "... very much for your testimony.  It is never easy to say I am sorry and especially to say so in public and therefore we want to say just how much we appreciate what you have done.  This Commission is called the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and if we are able to make a small contribution to reconciliation here in Upington, we will believe that the Commission has been worth all the trouble and you say that the community has already accepted you back but that you have felt, and it is a very noble thing that you have done, you have, it won't bring back the person that you killed but it will somehow pour balm on the pain in the hearts of his family and we want to thank you for that.  We are very concerned at the testimony that you have given about the destruction of records.  One of the tasks of this Commission is to try to follow up all of this kind of thing.  In fact I have just had a letter from the Minister of Safety and Security informing me that many records have been destroyed in the police service and we are asking that investigations must be put under way to discover what records, who destroyed them, who gave the instructions for this to happen and we will certainly follow up what is a very serious matter because it means that we will not always be able to know what happened precisely.  The records are important in assisting us.  We may be able obviously to corroborate things that people claim because others are there to testify, like I mean in your case there would be the family who say yes this killing did happen and, well of course you will confess that you did shoot and the families, as they think you did it, so in this case we are all right.  We may not always have it quite as straightforward as that.  We are a Commission that seeks to look at the past, to make all of us realise how horrible that past was, for thus not to pretend it didn't happen.  We must say yes all of these things happened.  On all sides people did all sorts of things but now we want to deal with it, we want those who did the things that are wrong to acknowledge they have done them and let them be surprised at the fact that people are ready to forgive them and we hope, I mean, that your example will be followed by others, the example of this community.  We thank you the people of Upington and Paballelo, people who have suffered as much as you have suffered, who are able to show the world that it is in fact possible to deal with pain and suffering and anguish in a way that is not destructive.  We could easily have become like Bosnia, like Rwanda where people say you did such and such to us, we are going to pay it back.  South Africa has, ja I mean, maybe God loves us in a way that is almost different from the ways that God loves people in other places, I don't know, because as we have sat here and listened, you say what has stopped people from saying I want to revenge.  Our people on the whole have not said that.  People say we want to know who did it and then we can talk about forgiving and many forgive and in many of our communities, people who hurt others still live in those communities.  They are accepted and we want to thank God for the fact that you are such people.  You are people who have suffered but you are also people who have said we have humanity ... got to try to restore relationships.  Maybe God is saying, South Africa I want you to do this so that you may be able to show people in other countries how to deal with past, how to deal with pain, how to deal with suffering.  This weekend a group from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is going to Rwanda.  The government of Rwanda have invited us and said please can you come and help us share a bit of your experience and maybe the things that are happening in our country are for the sake of the world as well.  That we must not feel maybe proud, we must just be thankful that God has made us as God has made us, that we should be people who can accept pain and not go on the streets to wreak revenge.  But we hope that those who have caused others pain, don't take it for granted, this forgiveness, because there are, I think, many in our country who think it is easy to forgive.  It is not easy to forgive.  A mother of four who has a child and a mother of a four year old who has a child killed like that, it is not easy for her to forget, as we have heard and so we appeal to the people of our land, please let the people know what it is that you did and ask to be forgiven and you will be surprised that the people will forgive me.  Now although I scolded you once or twice, I think you are not such bad people.  Actually I think you are very good people and I am going to clap you but because it will look silly, you people will say well long ago we thought that there was something wrong with Tutu's head, so in clapping you for being such a wonderful group of people, can give yourself a nice clap.  Come on!  Thank you.  Before we finish, Dominee Beukes...",
