Your evidence will also give us some background for the next case which we will hear, which deals with the same incident.  The witnesses coming after you will also talk about people who were shot and killed in the same incident.  So you're going to tell us your own story, your own experiences but it will also give us some context and background for the testimony which we are about to hear, which we will hear later.  So bearing that in mind I am going to ask you to sketch a bit of the background for us, especially as regards the political circumstances reigning at the time because it is important to scrutinize the events very closely to be able to understand what exactly happened.  Would you please sketch the circumstances and background for us, your own personal involvement as well.  That will give us some background to the events.  Over to you.",

            " Well you see sir it started during 1988, we were transferred to Keimoes to the Kakamas High School.  The school had to be given a name and we were appointing candidates for the list of candidates.  We used different names, Andrew Julies High School and W A Boesak High School - Oranjesuid was a name, there was Oranje Over was also suggested to be put on the list of names and we held a ballot to vote about the issue of a name.  The result of the poll was that the W A Boesak would be the name of the school.  Our school principal then changed the name.  Some of these ballot papers were destroyed and some of our teachers who were involved in trying to find out more information about these irregularities.  Now the Reverend Andrew Julies had handed over some money to the school because it was the government's money irrespective of whether his name would be used or not but we felt that W A Boesak, was Alan Boesak's father, was buried next to the school and we felt that the school should be named after but then they changed their minds and sent two names to the provincial education department.  They sent Andrew Julies and Vaal, somebody Vaal, that was another name that was suggested and the W A Boesak name was set aside.  We immediately then took action.  We made out posters and placards to show our resistance to the school principal and the school committee who had done this to us and the next day when we got to school the name Andrew Julies was printed on the board in front and we then removed this board because we were angry, because we knew we had won the vote and we were angry because they were doing this in a very undemocratic way.  There had been a lot of bungling so we were angry.  On the 13th February I was at home.  The security branch of the South African Police started making enquiries about who had been involved in this whole matter.  Bernard Beukes and myself and Henry van Wyk.  Well the security police were looking for us and some nights we had to go and sleep in the cemetery so we could escape their clutches.  Now at that stage they were reducing the number of teachers, that was part of the strategy to try and prove that the teachers were also rioters and instigators of violence and there was a Mr van der Heever and Franklin Sonn, these people came to us for a conference and the next day we climbed over the fence and we entered the school through the back door at the hall and we approached Mr Rudolph van der Heever from behind and told him that the security police was looking for us.  Mr van der Heever then went to the principal's office and made a call to the security branch of the police.  Now the vehicles were outside looking for us and Mr Rudolph van der Heever then, he was on his way in a yellow Cressida to say that he had phoned the security branch headquarters in Upington to tell them that they must leave us alone.  On the 13th February, we were at home and the police arrived Ambrosius took them into the house and there were 10 or 12 of them and they searched the entire house and they searched everywhere, turned everything upside down.  I don't know what they were looking for but maybe they thought I would be stupid enough to leave names of teachers lying around and my name and all bits of evidence.  Now we didn't operate in that way.  We were very cautious, we hid these bits of evidence and names.  Now Ambrosius took them through the house but I can't believe that it, that they could search a house in such a short space of time.  They looked at my books and threw them around and then one policeman outside the house started shooting with this pump action shotgun and I said well what's going on.  Some of the teachers started singing freedom songs and supported us because we were sitting under the tree and I gained a bit of courage and I stood up.  My uncle was sitting next to me and one of the policemen then hit me on my ear with the rifle butt and blood started flowing and they kept on hitting me and I thought why is he assaulting this person so unnecessarily because the man's asking them what are they looking for?  Not long after that the man started shooting in the street and he walked around the corner and continued shooting and I thought this man is going crazy.  He is snapping as a result of the tension and he then threw smoke bombs and they jumped into the combi    and raced away.  As a result of the shooting, people were killed, is that right? ---  Yes.  Yes a boy, Michael Julius and Rosaleen Cloete, they were killed.  They were shot dead.",

            "... that you and your colleagues were concerned that the views of the community should be taken seriously and we hope that this is something you would want to continue even now, now that we have a democratic dispensation because sometimes having got there we begin to forget why we got there.  We struggled in order for our people to know that they are important, they matter, their views are taken seriously.  We would want to look again at court records to find out what actually did take place because often it appears as if there was a kind of collusion between the security forces and our courts and that is why often there seems to have been a miscarriage of justice it appears.  We would like to be able to look at that and this is one of the reasons why we are asking that the legal profession should come and make a submission to the Commission that the medical profession, the judiciary, so that we can try and get a clear picture whether people in these various institutions who used their position to uphold an unjust system, did they do things which would encourage the violation of people's rights and many in the underprivileged, the oppressed sections would say that there was no question at all that apartheid permeated our entire society and affected all sorts of things and we need to be able to give details of this inter-connectedness but we are glad you were there in the dark days and now we are in the light and you have helped with your colleagues to help us to come into the light and we must preserve that light and not allow it to be put out because nowadays we sometimes see people who have forgotten what it cost us to put on the light that has destroyed the darkness and they treat the light as if it was something cheap and we need to remember that the price that has been paid is a very, very heavy price.
