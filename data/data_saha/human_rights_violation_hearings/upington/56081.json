We were watching the people and I told Karel we have to go back because there are a lot of people assembled, they look like policeman.  I told Karel that we had to go back home.  Before we could turn around these people dispersed and as we were trying to turn around and go back home we heard the first shot.  And when we heard that shot my child fell down and she just said Mammie and I could just see blood.  Karel picked up the child.  I ran after her.  Fortunately a car from Springbok came there.  We stopped the car and this car took us to the hospital.  When we came to the hospital the sisters called Doctor Kok.  He came there and he administered oxygen and he put up a drip.  Doctor Kok saw that she had two bullet wounds in her back and from her, right behind her right-ear right to her forehead where the bullet lodged.  Doctor Kok said this child had to be taken to Kimberley hospital.  There was another person who had to go to Upington and we got into the ambulance on our way to Kimberley but we could only get to Upington where this other person had to get off.  When we got there the nurses saw that this child has already died.  They took away the oxygen and the drip and I stayed there at the hospital.  They took my child from there.  I came back with the ambulance to Kakamas.  This is what my story is because I was with my child all the time.  There is nothing more I would like to add.",

There were policemen around.  There were bloodhounds which they were taken from these vans and these bloodhounds were in their yard.  My husband and I went nearer to that house.  We slowly approached to see what was happening and then I saw on the corner near the church this policeman was standing there.  He had a revolver in his hand and Oupa and Nantes they were having an argument with this man.  I walked up till the corner nearby the church where they were having a argument and I approached Nantes and Oupa and the policeman said, just go ahead and then I'm going to shoot you, and I said you must just go one step ahead and I'm going to shoot you.  I turned around.  I went back to where I had left my husband.  This was opposite Sergeant du Plessis' gate.  Before I got to my husband he directed me with his eyes backward because I didn't feel, I felt jittery.  I didn't look back but somebody touched my shoulder.  Before he could touch my shoulder and then suddenly Oupa and Nantes were shot with teargas.  He touched my shoulder and he said Granny run, Grandpa run, I'm going to shoot and immediately I started running.  As I started running I didn't run right to the front, I ran sideways and I saw he didn't give me any chance and suddenly I fell down in front of Sergeant Matthys' house.  I fell flat in the road because this man was shooting.  When I got up I crossed the road to my own house.  When I got there Michael, little Michael was lying there, he was dead.  He was shot dead on the stoep.  There he was standing by the gate and I could see the blood there and he just made it to the stoep and he died.  It was just a lot of blood.  He was lying in a puddle of blood.  When I saw Michael I turned back, I crossed the road again and I went back to that man and now he was shooting down in Clare Street and he said, sir, come, come, look, look, that is where my son Michael is lying.  You shot him dead.  He just looked at me.  He just looked in that direction and he kept on shooting.  He just walked down the road in the direction of the Thomas' house.  I returned home and nobody has been there to see what has happened to Michael and then the hospital at Kakamas called me for somebody to sign the document.  I had to sign for a operation for my sister's son.  When I came there they were already in the ambulance.  This child had to be taken to Upington for a emergency operation because the bullet was lodging in his stomach, his spleen had to be taken out, had to be removed.",

It's not far these two houses and then he started shooting.  He was shooting down the street.  He was aiming down the street.  I fell to the ground then but that was still not enough and then he also went, crossed the road into another road and he aimed down that road and kept on shooting.",

            "I am speechless at the moment because if you listen to these stories you can't believe that these things really happened, that people were so humiliated and that their lives were so cheap.  How can one shoot a four year old little girl just like that and in such a way that Desiree was shot?  It seems like a nightmare.  It seems like just a story you can read in a story book, it can't be real, it couldn't really have happened.  It's perhaps easy for us to say to you we feel with you, we have sympathy with you but what does it help?  What happens is that the new government and the parliament have said let us listen to all these stories.  Let us afford people the opportunity to tell their stories so that the whole nation, our whole country can learn what happened in our past and so that we can be determined to make sure that these things never ever happen again in our country.  We can say on behalf of us all we feel very sorry for you and we pray that God can support you, that God can stay in your hearts and souls and take the pain from there.  Nothing can bring your children back but perhaps like the mother said, although this had happened, it was perhaps a contribution to what is happening in our country at present.  At the moment we have a new democratic dispensation, we're living in a new country where everyone appreciates what you are, we appreciate what you have gone through and we are thankful that you have come here today to tell your stories.  We say thank you again.",
