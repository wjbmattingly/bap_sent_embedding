I asked him what was wrong. and the white person never answered me.  \n They took him from the bakkie and put him down on the stoep.  He was lying on the stoep.  I asked for the man, Gert Cloete who was with them, what was wrong with my father but they never answered me.  This white man went back to his own house and I tried to sustain my father but I couldn't help him at all.  This white man came back and said, is this bastard still alive, and I said you can't talk like this, you brought him here like this but he didn't give me an answer and drove off again.  He went back to his house and later on he came back again - has this bastard died already - and I said you can't talk like this, this is my father.  He drove off again.  I tried to help my father but it was to no avail.  \n My mother came home then and she said she must try and get a vehicle to get my father to the doctor.  She went off and tried to get a motor vehicle to take my father to the doctor.  We took my father to the hospital by car.  We only went to the hospital on Friday and they put a drip in his arm.  My mother talked to my father but he couldn't utter one single word.  We returned home again.  On Saturday morning we went to the hospital again and there we heard that he had died.",

We hope that we can investigate this matter further to try and find out what exactly happened to your father.  Perhaps this will soften the pain in your hearts and souls and this will be a kind of ointment which will heal the wounds that you have in your hearts.  \n One cannot believe that things like this could have happened in our country, that people's lives were so cheap.  One just could take a gun and shoot another person like an animal or in this case, one doesn't know whether it was poison or what had happened.  But we just want to say, because we also feel hurt and we also feel with you and we pray that God will help all of us that incidents like this never ever happen again in our country.  \n Thank you very much.",
