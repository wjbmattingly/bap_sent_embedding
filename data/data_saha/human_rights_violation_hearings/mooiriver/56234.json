            "  On the 3rd of December I was painting the house, particularly the sitting-room, and just as I finished - my mother was present, as well as my sister's daughter.  Just as we were starting to put the furniture back into the sitting-room, as we were doing that - I think we were fitting the curtains at that time - we heard some gunfire outside, and my mother said we should leave whatever we were doing, we will finish off the following day.  And we abandoned those duties.  At that time we heard gunfire up to the time that we went to bed.  I think later on, at about half past three in the morning, I heard my mother waking us up.  She was at the sitting-room.  She woke us up and she said, \"Here is Inkatha group.  They have come to attack.\"  At that time we heard the sound of shattering glass.  They were breaking the windows, and we were scared to go out of the bedroom.  It was myself, Thando, as well as my daughter, who was six years old at that time, and my boy, who was one year six months at that time.  We were scared to go out of the bedroom.  My mother was saying that she could see people breaking the windows, as well as the wall cabinet, and she said that I should come out and help her to remove those goods so that they would not be broken, but I was very scared to go out.  And Thando said that I should open up the wardrobe so that she could hide herself in there.  As I was just opening the wardrobe she said she was smelling smoke and she could see some flames from the back house.  We went out through the back window, the bedroom window, which was obscured by a shack and they couldn't see us from that direction.  So she jumped out and we ran to the neighbour's place.  I threw the other baby, that is the one year six months old, and I threw the other one who was six years old.  We jumped the fence and went to Zokela's place.  Just as we were entering the passage we noticed that we were being followed, and some were accosting us at that time, and when we tried to knock at this  house they just couldn't open the door.  I think they were also scared.  I took the smaller child into the toilet.  As they were still knocking at the door I got into the toilet, and luckily the toilet was not locked.  I pushed the door.  I was having the baby in the other hand, and I could hear them saying that they should come and push the door and kill me because I was in the toilet.  I think it was the Almighty's power that they did not come for me.  I stayed in the toilet for quite some time, and when I went out to try and see what had happened to the rest of the group I saw my sister's child, Thando, sprawled on the ground.  She had been stabbed, and at that time they had opened the doors at this house because there were soldiers.  The child who was six years old had been taken into the house, and I ran to my place because when we left the house was burning, and I knew that my mother did not survive.  And when I went out the soldiers refused me permission to go to my place, and I insisted on going because I could see that the house was burning.  And as I was going there I came across them along the way, but I also survived.  I was rushing home to try and rescue my mother.  When I got to the house the house was filled with smoke and I couldn't see anything.  I couldn't even see where my mother was.  I was not able to go into the bathroom to fetch some water.  I asked for water from the opposite house and they gave me water.  They also helped me to try and put out the fire until I was able to put out the fire, and I went inside.  I found my mother sprawled on the passage.  The way that she had been stabbed the whole place was just a pool of blood.  She had 24 stab wounds.  I think everybody just took his turn to stab.  I tried to pull her outside because the house was still burning.  I dragged her outside and I was trying to extinguish the fire all at the same time.  And I left her lying outside and I ran back to the house where we had sought refuge, and I discovered that she had been taken an put alongside the road, and some had speculated that she was already dead at that time.  And my six-year-old was hit with a big rock on the chest, and they left him there for dead.",

I remember reading about this incident at the time in the newspapers, and I remember it was a short piece in the newspaper and it said 18 people had been killed in Brandville township, and then the article went on to talk about the conflict between the IFP and the ANC.  But it didn't tell us about what happened that night.  It didn't tell us about the horrors that you experienced, and you have brought that to life here today in a very real way for us, and enabled us to understand how terrible it must have been for you at that time.  This massacre in 1991 has been quite well documented since then, and the IFP hostel residents concede that it was from that hostel, and it was supporters of that party, that came out that night and attacked people and killed them, and they say that they did it in order to prevent an attack which they believed was going to take place later in the day, or later in the week.  But, whatever they believed, nothing on earth can justify what they did that night.  These people called themselves an impi, a group of armed men, warriors.  They weren't men, they weren't warriors, they were cowards and they were murderers, because that is really all that one can say about people who break into a house and stab to death an elderly woman and her granddaughter.\nIt's also shocking that nothing was done by the police, that statements weren't even taken, that people weren't arrested and prosecuted, and locked up for this terrible deed.  And we hope that this sort of thing will never happen again, and if it did happen again that there would be a very, very, very different response from the authorities and the police.\nWe will try and do what we can do to find out who the person is that you mentioned, whether that person was ever investigated, although it will be a very difficult job.  This took place a long time ago.  Many of those people have probably left Mooi River.\nBut we thank you again for coming here, being brave enough to come and talk to us and tell us that story, and we hope that the fact that you were able to appear on stage there together has given you both some strength to deal with this incident.

            "  I was still working at that time.  I was from work.  I knocked off at 6 o'clock.  At that time there was violence in the area.  When I arrived home it was at about half past six.  I saw a group of people near the hostel.  They were standing there.  I didn't know what was going on.  I thought to myself maybe it was the usual violence.  And I got home.  I found my wife and my sister and my brother-in-law - my elder sister.  They told me they were leaving.  They said they were leaving because my sister was scared of the gunfire and she had diabetes.  She was scared, and she said she can tell that violence was going to erupt soon because there was a group of people near the hostel.  And my wife as well said she was leaving with my sister and my brother-in-law.  Then they left for 'Maritzburg.  I was left with my son.  As I was sitting there I heard gunfire.  For a long time I heard that loud noise of gunfire, and people were running up and down, and some of them were running away to Mshayazafe location.  And I saw people running up and down and I realised that it looked like people were fighting each other, and gunfire was all over the place, the noise.  And I went inside the house.  I told my son to come inside the house.  I told them not to run away, because I was scared that if they try to run away they'll meet other people or a group of people and shoot them, so I decided that we should stay inside the house.  As we were inside the house I heard a voice saying there were two boys being shot up the street.  I didn't know who those boys were, and then I started asking my other sons where's Nkosinathi, my other son.  And then they told me he is gone up the road to my brother's place.  I started getting scared.  I was real scared.  After a while it started raining, and then the gunshots stopped, people stopped firing.  And then as it was raining one guy came and knocked.  He knocked very hard and then I asked who was there, and then he said it was Bhekani Sikosano.  And then I asked Bhekani Sikosano why was he knocking here, what was he looking for, who is after him, and then he said, \"No, no one was after me, but I need to tell you something.\"  And then he told me that my son had been killed, and he also told me that they have asked someone for a ride, or to transport him to hospital, and when he arrived in hospital he was already dead.  After that I asked him what happened.  He told me he was in hospital.  Late at night the rain stopped raining and the soldiers came, and they were looking for guns.  They were old men, old soldiers, and they were going in people's houses looking for guns, and they said they were looking for guns.  I don't know whether they found guns in other people's houses.  And it got quiet.  Early in the morning my children were crying.  I told them to go in another bedroom to sleep in there, and I didn't sleep in the same bedroom with them.  Late at night I went outside to look.  I saw a group of people again, and they had spears all of them, and I realised that it was impi.  And they were throwing stones in people's houses, windows were broken, and they were coming up to our area where we were staying.  And I told my sons not to talk, not to cry, they must keep quiet, I'll hide them.  And I tried to hid them.",

And then again we've heard evidence that after these searches by the police attacks on that same section have taken place, and it's become quite clear to us that the reason why the houses were searched was in order to facilitate the attack later in the day, or to make the attack easier, in the sense that people in those houses would not be able to defend themselves.  And it seems as though this is something which may have happened here in Brandville, but this is evidence which we haven't heard before, and we certainly will investigate that aspect.   Now, you've heard what I've said to the previous witnesses who gave evidence here, Ria and Mildred Madlala, and the same thing applies to the death of your son.  He was killed on the same day as that attack took place, and we know that it's a terrible thing to lose a child.

            "  It was on the Saturday, June 16th.  I think it was in the late afternoon, just after lunch, because there was a funeral at Mthethwa's house on this particular day.  There were three of us in the house.  That is myself, my wife and Mdudi Mkhulu, who was a builder, and he had come with a building contract.  There was nothing out of the ordinary on that particular day.  I went into the house, because we were sitting outside the house in the yard, the three of us.  And when I got into the house I heard somebody screaming and asking as to, \"What is it that you are hitting me with?  You've got a sharp instrument that you are hitting me with.\"  And I heard Mdudi Mkhulu screaming and saying that he had been shot.  He tried to stand up, but he couldn't.  And later on we discovered that the police were shooting at the residents, and Mdudi Mkhulu went into the house with my wife and he was limping.  And when I looked at her dress on the right-hand side the dress was torn, as well as the petticoat.  There was a",

I fortunately got Mr Mthembu's car and I requested him to help me take my wife to the hospital.  Mthembu was from the funeral, and he took his car and took my wife to the hospital.  And we went past the police.  We stopped the car right in front of them and Mthembu showed me the station commander, who was coming from the van which was parked nearby Ngcongo's place.  It was Sergeant du Toit on the other side.  He was also on top of the van.  He also had a gun.  Mthembu explained to the station commander, George Niehaus, that my wife had been shot and she was lying outside the house.  He just said he was very sorry about what had happened but he just couldn't help us.  And we went past and tried to get some medical help in town.  Because it was on a Saturday the doctors' surgeries were closed.  And as we were still confused in town, not knowing where to go, we saw quite a number of vans passing up the road.  It was Sergeant du Toit in his own van, together with his policemen, and there was also a police Casspir.  We followed them to the police station and we got to the police station at the same time.  We spoke to the station commander once more and told them that we couldn't get a doctor to help my wife.  That's when he started to even look at my life and examine her injuries.  He said that my wife had been shot with a rubber bullet, and I asked him as to how he could say this is a rubber bullet.  How could it have torn her clothes if it was a rubber bullet?  I went on to ask him as to what was happening, why was my wife shot, because where we were sitting there was no large group of people who looked like they were rioting, it was perfectly calm in that area at that time.  He asked me whether I was impressed with what was happening in Brandville.  He asked me as to how much Majola's house cost, and I realised that he was taking sides and I stopped talking to him at that stage, but I further asked him as to what was I supposed to do with my injured wife.  He said we should take her to the nearest police station and not to them, and we took her back to the house.  When we got to the house she couldn't stand up and get out of the car.  We took her to the Brandville Clinic, where they phoned the ambulance from Mjezi.  The following day on the 17th she was transferred to Mjezi Hospital, and the x-rays indicated that the bullet was lodged inside her muscle.  But what surprised me was that the following Monday she was discharged from the Mjezi Hospital, and they said she would come back whenever she encounters any problem.  From then on she never was quite the same.  She was very sickly.  This happened in 1990.  1991 went by, and throughout 1990 she was ill.  At times she wouldn't be even able to get out of her bed.  Then in 1992 there were members of the Goldstone Commission who came to investigate, and they were the ones who followed the story up, and they wanted to know as to how she was shot.  They took my wife with.  They took her to Greys Hospital and they discovered that the bullet was still lodged in her body.  A few days went by and she went back.  They wanted to extract the bullet.  After that she became violently ill.  She was never better thereafter.  She was going in and out of the hospital.  Then in 1992 we submitted a statement to the Goldstone Commission, and we were called to the 'Maritzburg Supreme Court to testify with regard to this matter, and about George Niehaus.  There were quite a number of cases or matters in which George Niehaus was involved, but I never got to testify, but we later on heard that all the charges against him had been dropped, but it was never explained to us as to how this happened because we never got to testify.  And my wife was ill all that time, then in 1994 she gave up the fight.",

Then Reverend Shabalala gave them the money.  He is not staying far away from my area.  It's a distance approximately from here to the taxi rank.  When he gave him this R50,00 the reverend told him, the chairperson of the IFP, that we were going to have a night vigil, and he also told him that he also asked the police to come and safeguard the area.  I don't know what happened, or who told others that are members that the ANC was gathering at the reverend's place to safeguard the reverend.  Now, the Inkatha members came to look for the ANC who were safeguarding the reverend.  I think someone went to the IFP and told IFP lies, and then they came because they knew that we will be there, most ANC members will be there.  They came to the church.

And the violence started once more in 1991, and that's when I lost my wife.  It was on the 3rd of December.  There was some noise outside and the soldiers were moving around the streets, patrolling, and on that particular day we did not - that night we did not sleep.  At about 4.00 am we heard some gunshots from outside and we woke up and looked at White City, and we could see the Inkatha impi at White City, going around burning people's houses.  And at my in-laws' place we saw a certain house, Mr Zuma's house, being burnt down, and my wife jumped and went out.  She wanted to go and check my son, who had gone to my in-laws to visit, and I was left with the daughter.  By the time she got to the place they had already finished burning the house and they were coming towards our place, and they came across my wife.  And there's a certain person I was working with by the name China.  His other name was Sidney Zulu.  And he tried to hold my wife.  Amongst the other people who were hiding themselves they saw him grabbing my wife, and my wife pushed this man and went to knock at the door, and this group of people followed my wife.  And the other one took out an assegai and stabbed my wife from the front, and the assegai went through to the back.  And we got a report that she had been stabbed.  We tried to get some transport, but people had run away because they were scared that they would be attacked.  When I got to her I touched her.  I saw a little hole just above her breast, and when I turned her over I saw that she had been stabbed from the back and the assegai went through to the front.  That's when the police came.

            "  Yes, I would like to add something.  I would like to explain as to the circumstances before my father's death.  He was a councillor but he resigned later on, and they formed a Civic Association together with other members, and he was chosen as the chairperson, or elected as the chairperson of the Civic Association.  And thereafter, after the ANC had been unbanned in South Africa, they organised themselves and they wanted to launch a branch of the ANC in Brandville.  But before that could happen there was a conflict between the hostel dwellers and the people in the location, who were led by Walter Mchunu.  There is a certain house that was burnt, the gas matter, and Walter Mchunu said my father was a suspect because he was the leader.  And he said my father should pay for the house that had been burnt and the gases that were stolen.  And my father approached members of the community and they collected money, and on this particular day that he was attacked, but survived, NUSI(?) were not in speaking terms with my father.  But they couldn't shoot him on that particular day, he survived the attack.  And there is a person who came and asked as to what was happening, because he is the one who was picking the bullet that had missed my father.  He didn't want to hand over the bullet, and I think my grandmother was confused on that aspect.  When they phoned the police station Niehaus is the one who answered the phone, and Niehaus asked as to whether my father had died, and we said no, and we reported that people had run away.  Then he said there's nothing he could do.  He will only come when my father is dead just to take his body.  And after some time thereafter, that was in 1991, just before he died, the police who came to our place gave wrong names to my father.  Because we ultimately got the names through JJ, who is a member of the Parliament, to get the names of these policemen who came to our place.  They went to fetch him at his workplace, and they said they were looking for guns, and when they couldn't get the guns they took the car.  After having taken the car - I think after three weeks they instructed my father to come and pick the car up, and he said he was going to open up a case because he doesn't  know what they had done to the car.  He didn't want to take it back, he wanted it to be checked by AA because he suspected that they might have probably planted something or a bomb in the car.  Then after he died they continued with their story and said the car was stolen.  And at that time that they attacked a small child, Nogu, that is the last-born at home, who was four years old at that time, she was shot four times.  And I do have a photo of her when she was in the hospital, and the people who were arrested - or who were suspects at that time, was a certain person by the name of Duke Mbongwe, China, who is working at the firm - I don't remember the other ones.  And there was an inquest held, and there's a certain person who was a State witness by the name of Hadebe, who testified that he had been bought.  He was going to be paid for killing my father.  And they - he said he was going to be paid for killing my father, and they took him to the firm and he saw my father and identified him positively.  And probably they had put him somewhere to hide.  And at some stage he came across my father.  He greeted my father, and when my father greeted back he felt bad about killing my father and he ended up not killing him at that stage.  And when he gave testimony at the 'Maritzburg Court he said the who came to him to report that they had already killed my father, because he could not kill my father because at that time he was sick.  And Walter Mchunu, as well as Alec Zokela came to report to him that they had already killed my father.  At the inquest the suspects - Niehaus was one of the suspects, that he colluded with the other suspects in the killing of my father.  And at the inquest they said they were looking for Ace, and I think his surname is Mchunu, and he was a hostel dweller, A C Mnikathi.  And the police came to identify him, and when they got to the hostel they found his bed well made, that they did search the place.  Mchunu prevented them from continuing to search the place.  He is the one who denied and said he is no longer living there.  And that's where it ended.  And when I met that policeman who was handling the case at a later stage - I met him at Estcourt and asked him as to what was happening with regard to my father's case.  He said he was no longer involved in that matter, and if I wanted to know more I should go to the police station and find out as to who took over my father's case, because he was dealing with car thefts now.  I told him that if he had stopped he should have reported to us so that we would be able to get in touch with the person who was dealing with the matter, and that was the end.",

They were roaming around White City where we stay, and I was on the other location, the adjoining location.  And as I was going down I realised that I couldn't go to White City, and I hid myself at Mrs Dlamini's place, which was next to the Dutch Reformed Church.  And I got there.  I realised that the fight and the violence was going on, and during the night she asked the Dutch priest to keep us for the night because we could go back to White City because the fight was still going on.  But the priest said we could not go to his place to sleep.  He said when we hear the footsteps of Inkatha members we should put the lights on so that they would recognise or realise that we were Inkatha members.  He further went on to explain that all the houses that were lit were Inkatha members' houses, so that was the only way we could survive.  And then the houses were burning at that time.  The Inkatha was burning down the houses.  Then the following day there was fog, and I wanted to go to my brother's place first, the one who was next to us, and I came across my sister's daughter, Vicky.  She was crying.  Her name is Vicky.  The surname is Verasamy.  She is Indian.  She called me and told me that my uncle had been stabbed the previous night.  I couldn't go on further to my uncle's place.  They said the police had taken him.  The Inkatha people stabbed him inside the house.",

            "Mrs Zuma, thank you very much for coming in today.  I don't think you were here for most of today, but if you were you would have heard stories about people who were shot in churches, elderly women who were shot in their houses, children who were shot in their houses, a young child of four years old who had a large rock thrown on her chest - terrible things done by groups of armed men, men armed with terrible weapons, guns and spears and sticks, and the story that you have told us is similar to that.  As you have said yourself, your uncle was a disabled, elderly person, and it's a terrible, callous and brutal thing to have attacked and killed that person, who could not possibly have defended himself.  And we understand some of the pain that you still feel for that family member of yours.\nBut it's important that you have told us that story, because it gives us a much clearer picture of what it was like for people in Brandville during those terrible years, 1990 and 1991, and we hope that those sorts of experiences will not take place again here in Brandville, and that there will be peace between the hostel residents and the township residents.  And if there isn't, that the police force that we have now is a better one, and one that takes its public duties seriously.\nSo again we thank you very much for coming in and telling us your story.  \nPROCEEDINGS  ADJOURNED  TO  1997/05/29\n/PROCEEDINGS",
