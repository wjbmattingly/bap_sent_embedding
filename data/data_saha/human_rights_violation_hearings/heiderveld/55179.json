I am not going to buy this paper after all ,in case  when we get home there is no bread. Then I can buy you some bread with this R1,00.\"\n     And then we went home, and only when we got home I found my younger sister there who stays out in Hammanskraal now.

I don't think that they were expecting me home that day, because I went up with a lift and came back home again with a lift.\n     And then she said, \"Ooh! I don't know where the aunties are of the street\".  I said,\" Why?\"  And then she said, \"No, they said when you get home I must call them so they could be here when you get home\".  I said,  \"Now, what is wrong?\"  So - no, then she ran out and then she came back with these people and then it was only then that I heard that my husband was missing since the 26th of December.  This was now the 6th of January and nobody knew where he was and... and they'd been looking all over for him and they couldn't find him in the mortuaries, in the hospitals... and that was that.\n     And then I remember later that evening my mother-in-law came with my brother-in-law Les, and they had the same newspaper that I nearly bought in Bellville and my husband's picture was in the front page of that newspaper.",

And the following morning a friend of Henry's came (his name was Martin) and another one (he used to work for a funeral undertaker). And another friend and, I think, one of his brothers. Then we went looking for Henry.\n     And, I don't know... we were driving towards Claremont. Because now we - because as they said they were - they looked all over and they couldn't find him. And now we thought, okay, we might just go and look for him in... in Wynberg.  First at the hospital there and come back from Wynberg doing Cape Town and so on.  And while we were in Claremont  we changed our minds and we said, okay, let's rather go to Groote Schuur Hospital. And on our way there, as we passed the mortuary,  we decided to go to the Salt River mortuary before going to the hospital.\n     And when we parked the car, this white chap who worked at the mortuary... I remember him saying to Martin (this friend who was driving me there)... he said to him\" Man hier le 'n man wat nes soos jy lyk ek het gedink dis jy\". There was something wrong because the whole time I thought, okay, I don't think that he could be dead. Maybe he could of skipped the country, or whatever...you know.\n     And it was only then (because Henry and Martin they were supporting those Afro hairstyles at that time they looked, you could have thought they were brothers)  and so, really, we went in and they pushed him on a trolley in the passage there.  And there was a glass - a partition- a glass partition. And then I saw him, but I said, \"But he looks very funny you know\".\n     And it's only when I looked again that I saw why he looked funny.  And then we went home and on coming home I sent Martin and them to our parish priest (whom I see is here also) Father Dick, to go and tell my mother-in-law what happened, because I stayed behind in the house with the children.

            "It was Boxing Day in 1976, and it was late, I think.  Ja, and... it was dark on that day and I was in the house at NY50 no 6.  While I was in the house, I heard a loud sound, a loud noise coming from outside. It sounded like people.  I heard that the people outside were making this noise. I heard a loud banging on the door. Somebody was knocking.\n     When I opened the door, somebody said, \"You're  still opening the door, let's go\".  And we - and we found that it was the late Henry. I asked, \"Where are we going?\". I was told, \"Let's go to - to the battle\".  We were told that everybody must just go. All young men must go. It's only women and old men that must be left behind.\n     We were all told to go to the battle.  We were told that we should go and block NY78 because we were told that the \" wit doek\" people would be coming from Section 4.  They were coming to Guguletu and they were going to destroy all of us here at Gucks.  So we were now about to protect ourselves.  We went to - through NY57. Before we could come to the corner of NY54, we saw this car coming, but we couldn't - we couldn't see how many people were inside.\n     One of us saw one of these people and when this car got to the corner,  he  went to these people and he asked, \"What is going on now?\".  It turned out to be the police who were in this car.  They said, \"Oh, no! We are not here to fight. We are just here to protect you, because we know that there are people who are coming to beat you.\nNow this is why we are here to protect you\".  And then they said, \"Is that true?\". We said, \"Yes\". Then they said, \"Okay, it's all right\".  So they went through NY78. We came through 78. Now, we were about to block the road just to see, now, from where these people were going to approach us.  Now, while we were still standing there, when we looked further down there at NY78, we could see that there was a car coming. It's lights and everything were on. We could see that the car was coming.  Just in front of this car there was a Valiant, a red Valiant.\n     This Valiant was leading. Now, we were also a big group and in front of us there was the youth [indistinct] shouted and they said, \"There is a car coming over there\".  But we told ourselves that we were not there to fight. We were not going to fight with the police at all. We just wanted to find out about these people who wanted to come and beat us up. We wanted to find out, really, what was going to happen.\n     We were not even - we were not armed on that day, because our - our children just took us out of our houses. So we didn't even have a chance.  Somebody said, \"no,no... don't run away. Don't run away... aah, don't run away, you kidding!\".  When they came closer, they just came - they came right at the centre, they actually spread us out so that they could be able to see us from all angles.\n While we were...watching all that, and we were just waiting for the [indistinct] to come and approach us, the [indistinct] was saying quite a lot that they switched off the lights.   end of Tape 11, side B ... ... All this time we were... Henry, what happened, I think, is that I just left him just for a short distance.  The shots were going on during this whole period. I heard him saying, \"Hey, they shot me\".\n     While I was trying to look at him, I just wanted to find out what was going on, when I saw this. I could not stand it and so I ran.  Now, while I was running, I didn't know who was running behind my back.  I could - I could see that I was not alone. There was somebody chasing me, but I just told myself I was going to run. I was not going to get a chance to look at him.  I saw this fence in front of me and I jumped over it.   My persuer also jumped over this fence and then I saw an old-old truck. I think it's still there, that truck, and there were also dogs in the same yard.\n When these dogs were barking, we went under the truck.  And we looked - we looked at the gate and then we thought the best thing is to go through the gate.  I looked back. I saw this person who was running behind me. It was my elder brother. I said, \"Hey, brother. Hey, let's go. Let's run\".  There was no time to catch our breath. We saw \"boers\" coming.   I could only see their feet.  I heard one saying,  \"Where are the stupid people?\".  He said - I can't remember the name that he called- \"They went through that gate\", and there was another car coming over to pick them up on that side.\n My elder brother said to me,\"Just wait - just wait-wait-wait.  You go your way, I'll go my way.  I'll meet you at the house.  Now, we were just trying to survive.  And that's how we did this.  From there we split. I ran further alongside  the fence.\n While I was running, I thought we were in a big mess. I didn't even know what was going on there.  I was very scared. I didn't know what was happening because Henry came to wake me up. I wasn't even sure what was going on then.  He told me that somebody had been shot. The following morning I didn't even have an idea that somebody had been shot.  I didn't even know anything about Henry.  There were other people checking other people out.  And I just - and I just thought these people who were shooting other people were there among us.  I couldn't say anything to anybody, to anyone. I didn't trust anyone.  So, I just kept quiet. I was not going to say anything.  What was in my mind was that these boers were torturing us.\n There were so many things that happened to me in the past, the first time was in Bloemfontein, but now in Cape Town it's getting worse.  Even now I am speaking Afrikaans sometimes. I understand it these days.  I couldn't tell this poor woman next to me what happened to her husband.  I simply couldn't tell her, I saw - I saw the sadness in their - in the children's eyes, but I couldn't tell them anything still.\n Her husband was my best friend. We were together in the Drummer School at Santos. I was in the sports - we were doing boxing together. We were never worried too much about politics.  That's the time, now ,I thought... if she wants to know about her husband, she has to do it herself.  Even now, for me to be here, I didn't wish to be here.  After 20 years of not getting information, I don't know what to do and I don't want anything.",

Ms King, Pumla mentioned something that has struck me about the testimony today which is this exquisite cruelty in not telling people what have happened.\n I don't think it would ease the pain, but it certainly seemed to increase the pain to have to go from pillar to post, to go to police stations and hospitals and mortuaries.  It is important for us to take in this pain, all of us, and try to commit ourselves that we want to see a country where these things will never happen.\n Because whatever we may say about the people who committed atrocities (and we know that atrocities were committed on all sides of the struggle), we can keep remembering that they too, are God's children.  And that we - we need to keep reminding ourselves we do belong in one family.  And to help those who lost their humanity to recover their old. Again, we just want to say thank you and hope that the response of people here, the response of the people who hear your story in other parts of our country, such as the response we - we saw from this dominee whose letter - part of his letter I read this morning, that, that response somehow will strengthen you and give you comfort.
