<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ethel Nomalungelo Timba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Mr Chairperson, I would like to swear in the witness.  Ethel Nomalungelo Timba, please stand up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">ETHEL NOMALUNGELO TIMBA:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you.  I will lead you with questions.  I want to clarify this matter, Ethel.  You said in 1984 you were a member of ANC.  The ANC was banned at that time.  In which organisation were you a member?  Was it UDF?  Were you an underground member of an ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> I was a member of ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> ANC was banned at that time.  Were you a member of UDF?  Maybe you were working underground.  Please tell us your story briefly, because it is late now.  The Chairperson just told me that he wants coffee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> I am here today to give testimony about the funeral of one of the Tyuku family members, because I was one of the members who attended the funeral.  We were attending Madodana Tyuku's funeral in Port Alfred.  The police were there when we were going to the graveyard observing and trying to maintain peace.  When we came back from the graveyards, when we were going to, when we were about to reach the corner we met the police.  They then started shooting at us.  We did not ask anything, we ran away.  We managed to run to houses nearby, we went to hide under the beds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Was this a victim's funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> Yes, it was the one just described by Mr Gqolodashe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> After you were, you hide under the bed were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> One person came saying that we must come out, because Mr Mkwinti phoned the Magistrate to come and see the damage done by the police.  When we went out the tent was on fire.  We saw Mr Griffiths who was our Magistrate at the time.  We were taken by cars and the vans.  They took us to the doctor, Dr Dempers, in town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You were then taken from the doctor to prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What were you charged of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> I was sentenced for five years in which two years were suspended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> I was here in Grahamstown.  I stayed, I was detained here for three months.  I then was transferred to East London.  We applied for an appeal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You were in a group who stayed for five months in prison and then released on an appeal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> After that what was your state of health?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> After I was released I was not well, because even today I am under treatment every month.  I have to attend a treatment to the doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Are you working now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Where are you working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> I am working in the hospital in Port Alfred.  Even at work, sometimes I have to sit down, because I have a heart problem.  I cannot stand for a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Mam, what would you like the Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> Mr Chairperson, when I was arrested I had a baby of three weeks.  I have got nothing to ask from the Commission on his behalf, because when I came back from prison my child was six months old.  There was no connection between the two of us.  I do not have a husband, I have children and I am not well in my health.  The Commission will see what to do for me in order to help me and to support me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You would like the Commission to help you with the medical treatment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> Yes.  What happened is that I took a medical aid and my child is also receiving treatment from doctors, because when I came back from prison, the child was not well.  Every month I have to go for a treatment.  This costs me a lot.  The doctor told me to have pills every day.  I do make a mistake sometimes not to take pills, but I would be told to go home to have my pills, because they are supporting me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Is there anything else you want to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> No, there is nothing I want to add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> I will hand over to you, Mr Chairperson, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sandi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> The children you mentioned, how old are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> One of them is 17 years old, the other one is 11 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Are they at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> Yes, they are both at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> In which standards are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TIMBA:</span> The other one is doing standard five, the youngest is doing standard three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you, Mam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Ethel Timba, we thank you.  If, my colleagues have notified me that your story is similar to Mr Gqolodashe's story, we would have combined you, because you are talking about the same incident.  You were arrested on the same day, sentenced on the same time, you were released on an appeal.  We thank you for coming here with your story.  As a mother you were in a struggle.  We have noted your request.  We will combine them with those that have been brought to us before and we will hand them over to the authorities so that they can see what to do.  For now, we can say thank you.</p>
