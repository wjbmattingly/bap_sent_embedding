It was very brief, but indeed very touching and very deep.  We are going to proceed in the same fashion as in the past two days in this our last day here in Grahamstown.  We will ask that anyone who cannot understand Xhosa move to our administrative desk and obtain a set of headphones.\n Those who do understand Xhosa, we will appeal to you to please make these sets available to those who need them because yesterday there was a shortage of these headsets.  We will use Xhosa for our proceedings mainly except for those witnesses who prefer to testify in English and we request those people who have limited or no understanding of Xhosa to please get the earphones.  We request again that those be left on your seats when you leave after the end of the proceedings or when you decide to leave the hall.\n Tiny Maya will report to us on the order for today.",

We have a long list of people who will be appearing before the Commission today and we will appeal to everyone for your cooperation so that we can reach the end of our list in time and we appeal to you that you maintain discipline and order so that we can complete our hearings in time.  We normally have a set time aside in our hearings where we observe a moment of silence to pay respect for the deceased by announcing their names.\n We will now ask that everyone in the house rise, so that we can remember all those who have passed on.  We remember Mtandazeli Patrick mdyogolo, Nontle Koliti, Nonose Hoboshe, Yunguma Priscilla Hoboshe, Vuyiswa Hoboshe, Siphiwo Xhanga, Phindile Lhelhe Mbenge, Nontyatyambo Medeline Sandi, Jane Msuthukazi Matyani, Johnson Pakamile Mantile, Topsy Peter, and also Notiti Steven Kobese, Phindile Siyona, Thozamile Swartbooi Madakana, Selby Zanemali Ndingane.

May their souls and the souls of all the faithfully departed through the mercy of God, rest in peace, amen.\n We don't normally introduce people who announce people when we have our sittings, but we would like to welcome Reverend Lupata who is training priests of the Anglican Church here in Grahamstown, we would also like to welcome\nCyril Hartland who is a priest in Fort Beaufort and he is\nalso the Mayor of Fort Beaufort.

            "What happened too Mtandazeli is that it was a school day, although I cannot remember which day it was, he was on his way to school.  He had gone to school and he\ncame back from school that afternoon, had something to eat and went back for afternoon studies and at approximately 5 pm he had not come back yet, because normally they return back to school at 2 pm.  We were worried as to why he had not returned yet and we heard a toyi-toyi march past our house, move up our street.  We were then fairly certain that he was part of that toyi-toyi because  the children back then would join the toyi-toyi as soon as they heard one.\n At approximately 6 pm the Mdisa family came to our home to tell us that Mtandazeli had fallen at their house and they had come to fetch us.  We got into Mr Maneli's car and also the Mdisa family car and we went there.  When we got there we found him laying on the ground and they told us that he came there running and he told them that he had been struck behind his ear and that he had a headache.\n They asked him what they could do for him and he asked for headache tablets and said he would like to sleep.  They offered him a bed and he declined that and he said he wanted to lie flat on the ground.  They gave him these headache tablets.\n After a while - they kept checking on him and they found that he was laying very still and after a while they'd check on him every few minutes and at some stage they found a greyish fluid flowing out of his nose and they noticed that there was some hair missing from behind his ear.\n And they then realised that they should come and fetch us because we are related in some way and we found him laying there like that.  This Mr Maneli that was with the Mdisa family assisted us because he also had a car and he took us to Settlers Hospital.\n Because those were turbulent times - the 80's were\nturbulent times and there were so many toyi-toyi's, police presence and so forth, it was not easy for us to hear exactly what happened.  We just had to hear it through the grapevine because when we got to the Hospital, we met up with a Doctor White who told us, basically confirmed that he was deceased and then after a few days students came to sympathise with us after having heard that he was dead.\n And we appealed to these students that if anyone of them knew what happened, they should please tell us.  His one friend Whitey told us what happened and how it had happened.  Whitey's version of events was that they were toyi-toying up M-Street and when they got near the Nqoline Funeral Parlour the police came and dispersed them with rubber bullets and tear gas and what Whitey noticed was that while the police were standing there, Nombenqana and the Boers got out of the police vehicles and he directed, Nombenqana directed something at them and fired.\n This thing zoomed past Whitey and struck the person in front of him, who was Mtandazeli and it struck the back of his ear.  He fell and Whitey continued running.  Mtandazeli got up and ran into the Mdisa house where he fell.",
