            "Thank you, Mr Chairperson.  Bedford is a small town surrounded by many farms.  In Bedford the struggle for liberation started in schools.  Students formed their organisations.  This was also happening in the community where we formed organisations such as Bedford Community Organisations.  In 1985 when Comrades like Matthew Goniwe and Comrade Stofile, they use to come to our area to tell us about what was happening in our country.  The Comrades met and discussed about the ways of fighting the past Government.  While we were still discussing this, Comrade Matthew was killed.  Their bodies were found burnt in Greenwater Bay.  Comrades got together after hearing this.  We wanted to find ways to identify the killers.  We decided to close down shops, consumer boycott.  People are not supposed to go and buy in town.  The trouble started.  White people cried in town.  They said that they were not gaining anything.\n Police vans and Hippos would come to the township at night while we were sleeping as it was dark.  We would wake up and we would see soldiers and they would come with their vehicles and light the township.  In the morning you would wake up and see a soldier in front of your house with a gun.  The whole township was surrounded by the soldiers.  This made people to be angry.  They boycotted the councillors. Everything that belonged to the Government was a threat or \nan enemy to the people.  We tried to bring back the dignity of the people and people saw beer hall and the police houses as enemy to the people.  Comrades wanted to fight against anyone who was working for the Government.  The police will shoot people and disperse teargas to old men and women.  They would be taken to the hospital and small children, the beer hall was burnt down and everything that was seen to be part of the Government.  \n The situation was very bad because people did not know how to live, how to survive.  We would hear gunshots all over and you would hear that certain people have been arrested and certain things have happened and the people who were connected to those who were working for the Government were also affected.  There are cases where people who were buying in town, they will be dealt with and people would be arrested concerning such incidents.  Things would happen in places such as Cookhouse and those things would give impact to our area in Bedford.  That was the situation in Bedford at that time.  People were fighting for their rights.",

            "We were on our way to Comrade Matthew's funeral.  Our car broke on our way there and the police were on the road.  We were delayed on our way to Cradock.  We decided to go back home.  In the morning, after the funeral, I saw a Hippo in front of my house.  There were soldiers in that Hippo.  They wanted me, they took me to the Hippo.  I was on my way to work at that time.  They took me to the soldier's truck.  There were people from Adelaide, others were bleeding their nose.  The soldiers were all over them.  They were lying down.  We were taken to the Bedford Police Station.  We stayed there for three days.  We were then transferred to St Albans in Port Elizabeth.  We were not asked anything in St Albans Prison.\n In August I was taken together with other Comrades from Adelaide by a combi.  We were taken next to the sea and the police said that we were going to go to the sea and swim with the fish.  We were taken to the top floor in St Albans and they separated us.  I was together with Louis.  Louis took other Comrades from Adelaide to another room.  While I was still waiting there one black policeman from PE, Port Elizabeth came.  He was a short guy.  When I was explaining to the Comrades in Port Elizabeth they said it might be Vaku.  I was taken to a toilet.  There was a black drum filled with black water.  They told me to take off my clothes.  I asked them for what?  They demanded that I take off my clothes.  They told me to sit down, they poured this water over me.  This was very painful to me.  They told me to take, to wear my clothes and they took me upstairs to the room I was in.  \n When I arrived there I met Sam Gcali.  After a while two policemen from Port Elizabeth came in.  They said that is this the man who does not want to co-operate.  They would kick me, they would strangle me, take my, they would take my hair and they would tell me to swallow my hair.  This happened for a long time. They wanted to know my relationship with Matthew Goniwe and others.  I told them that I just heard about Matthew Goniwe.  I saw him in \nAdelaide in one funeral.  We were taken back to St Albans.  I was not feeling well.  I could not even eat.  On the following day I asked them to take me to the doctor.  The doctor weighed me and he told me that I lost weight, I lost five kilograms.  The doctor asked me what was happening.  I explained to him that I was being assaulted and tortured in prison.  That may be the reason for my losing weight.  \n In November 1985 we were released.  In May 1986 cars like a Nissan Skyline, combis and trucks, soldier's trucks came.  I was at work at that time.  I was working as a cashier at Bedford Hotel.  Aubrey van Jaarsveld came.  He said that he was going to, was picking me up, because I was wanted there.  I was taken to the barracks where the police were.  When I arrived there, there were white men there.  They were huge white men.  I did not know them, because they were not from Bedford.  They asked me Comrade Matthew, my relationship with him.  I told them that I knew Comrade Matthew, because he use to come to our area.  At the time he was already dead.  I told them that I also read about him in the newspapers.  One of them beat me and my nose was bleeding.  They gave me water to wash my face up.  \n Constable Maswili came.  They gave him a list.  They told him to write down what was written in the list to another paper.  They told us to go with them.  I asked them, where are you taking me?  They said I must not ask questions.  I was taken to this Nissan Skyline.  Police, two policemen were with me in this car.  One of them had a gun.  I am not sure whether it was a R4 or R5.  They pointed me with the guns in my back.  One Skyline was in front of us and others were at the back.  We went to an area, a building where jobs were created for people.  Maswili was told to \npoint out the people who were written in the list.  The people would be taken to the vans.  The police were talking to each other through their radios.  They were communicating with the police in other cars.  They would say that Ntsikelelo is working with us today.  Comrades would be taken by these police to the cars.  They took us to the police station.  The police argued with each other.  Some were saying I must be released.",

As we were this group of Comrades we wanted to get rid of the people who were known as the stumbling blocks.  In other words, people who were informers.  There were three ladies who were staying in Masikane area in Bedford.  They were Rooibot Chain, Selina Lange and Thembeka Sikasi.  They were together with the police.  They were having affairs with the police.  \n We sent certain Comrades to go and call these ladies, because a decision was taken that we will deal with them.  At that time it was half past four during the day.  They came to hear what they were called for.  We wanted to know about their position in the struggle in our community.  They did not give us an answer.  They told us they will shoot us.  They would get guns from their boyfriends and shoot us.  We must leave them alone.

I want you to look back, maybe if you can, I want you to tell the Commission how you feel today when you look back at your plans for burning these three ladies.  How do you feel today?",

What happened to you Mr Mentoor and Mr Bambiso is also painful, but what happened to women is not what is supposed to happen.  A woman at your age taken out of your\nhouse, being naked or wearing only an underwear, taken to prison and staying there with policemen for a long time.  This shows that people were not human, they were animals.  Mrs Bakauli is not a young lady.  We have her picture, her dignity was effected.  These people would not come to you and apologise, but on behalf of them, as a Commission, we would like to apologise to you.  We feel ashamed that we are part of people in South Africa and there are people, these are people, these are South African people who did this to you.  We are not saying that these things have to be done to men, but we are extra sensitive to women.  We thank the three of you and we thank the evidence from Bedford.  We will adjourn for lunch for one hour.",
