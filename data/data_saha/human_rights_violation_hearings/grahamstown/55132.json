I managed to go through the door.  Diliza came with a gun.  He broke the window with the back of the rifle.  I told him to break all the windows.  He insulted me and he put a gun in my neck.  I stopped talking.  After a while a casspir came, after a Casspir and then an ambulance came.  I was taken to the hospital.\n When I arrived there in the hospital there was one small room.  There was a coloured guy sleeping there.  He was dead at the time and one young lady and one police, white policeman.  I was taken to the ward.  This guy, white guy, took out hand-cuffs and hand-cuffed me.  The nurses asked him why are you hand-cuff, why do you hand-cuff him, because he cannot run away and he said that it was the Law, He was supposed to hand-cuff me.  One coloured man came to guard me.  He would change the hand-cuffs, he would hand-cuff me, my one hand to the, with the bed.  I stayed for two weeks in the hospital.  In the third week I was taken to the charge office, but when I was discharged there was a lawyer hired, Mr B Sandi.  \n On Monday I was released on bail.  I went to visit Mr Sandi.  He then transferred me to one lady to give out a statement to her.  This lady told me to consult a doctor in order to get a paper from the doctor, because we were trying to claim.  We then managed to get a doctor.  The doctor gave me tablets and some medicine.  We then went back to Mr Sandi with the paper from the doctor.  The case then continued.

When the case failed in the hands of Mr Sandi I went to the Legal Resource Centre and they told me to write to the Law Society and state what happened to my matter and they responded, I wrote to the Law Society after five years and they responded by saying that my file would not be able to be traced after five years and I then left the matter.\n I then came to the Legal Aid Clinic and stated my case and I was assisted by an elderly man who listened to my story and said, look, we would advise you to just let this case go, because it is an old matter.  If it was approximately three years old you could have had a chance.  I said to him, look, if a woman had shot me I would have let the matter be, but a man shot me and I am going to retaliate if I see him anywhere.  From there I tried to deal with this and last year I came back to the Legal Resource Centre where I met a young man who advised me to go back to the Law Society.  I told him that I had written to the Law Society and he then said I am afraid we will not be able to do anything for you, because the matter is quite old and I said, look, as men, if you assault me I am going to retaliate at some stage or another in whatever way.
