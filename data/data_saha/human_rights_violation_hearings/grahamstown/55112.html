<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>situation in your area because it is not clear why the police went to people's houses and kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> Nothing was happening Ma'am at that time.  We were sitting at home, I was just coming from work.  I was sitting with my wife and my grandchild.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a> We were sitting in the couch, it was myself, my wife, my grandchild and my daughter-in-law.  We heard a gunshot.  These people were coming towards my gate.  I was trying to go out and look at what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a> My daughter-in-law told me not to go out because those people had guns on them.  They then came to us and asked us why were you shooting at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Were these people asking you why were you shooting at them?</p>

<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> These people asked us why are we shooting at them.  My daughter-in-law then answered them, telling them that nobody was shooting at anyone.  They then told her to shut up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a> They shot at me, but I managed to bend down.  They then shot on top of me.  While we were still looking at that, they shot my wife and my son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What do you mean by saying that?  Did they kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> They shot my son and then they beat my wife in the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How was she injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> I don't know, but she was taken to the hospital and she passed away in hospital.</p>

<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> Jane was my brother's wife, Pakamile Johnson Mantile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was Johnson Jane's husband?</p>

<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened to you, why were they killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> I was at number 13 G Street and they were at number 28 Victoria Road with this mother and Peter.  I was on my way back from work at 5 pm where I was working at Lewis Stores and I went via my brother Johnson's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a> We were planning to go somewhere which was a church meeting.  And that was in 1987.  And he said, look I am not going to make it, he was working at GG at the time, the Waterworks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a> He was driving these bulldozers and loaders and the machinery used there.  I said to him, give me your jacket and your tie, I am going to go.  I am not going to go via</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>home, I am going to go straight to the church meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened when they were shot, what time were they shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> They were shot at approximately 7 or 8 pm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What news did you receive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> I was in J Street when a child came to me and said Uncle Pakamile has been shot.  The child didn't know why but the scull and brain was scattered all over the wall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>Is it possible that this person is still alive, it was just a small child.  My wife and I spoke and said this is very difficult to understand and she said that she did not think I should go alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a> We decided to go and tell my younger brother.  When we got there, we discussed what to do and we could see that it was quite busy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> When you went there, what did you find?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> When we got there, the place was full of soldiers and policemen and people and we were asked where we were going because no one was to go there.  We said that we were there to see what had happened.  We were family of the person who had been shot and then they opened up a way for us to go through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What were things like when you got there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> When we got to the house, I found my brother sitting like this, half of his head was shot against the wall.  Where he was sitting when I - he was still seated where I had left him sitting, and there was a hole in the wall and his - half of his scull had gone through that hole into the bedroom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a> His wife was still holding the potato which she was peeling and the bullet had penetrated her on one side and</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>gone out on the other side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you receive details of what had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> We enquired from the time we were coming on, we asked White policeman coming out on the other side of the school, carrying bottles of wine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> In your statement you say that these White policemen were intoxicated to such an extend that they told the court that they were so drunk that they did not know what they were doing?  Did your brother and his wife have any kids?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> Yes, they are with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How old are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> The oldest boy has been circumcised and the other two are also grown up now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Are any of them still at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> Yes, two of them are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is there anything else which you would like to say to us, with regards to the story?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> It is a long story but it is basically what I have told you but because nothing else could be done about the fact that they were dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was a trial ever heard at court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> Yes, there was a trial where we were represented by De La Harpe.  And as this gentleman said that policemen were found guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Were these policemen the same municipal policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> Yes, they were guarding the school because it was month end and they had received their salaries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What were their respective sentences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> It was - the one who was found guilty, was the one who was found who had shot at my brother and who</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>seemed to have emptied his cartridges on him</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you receive any compensation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> Yes, we did receive a bit of compensation after having instituted a civil claim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What is your request or what is your wish which you would like to express before this Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> I would like to ask this Commission for assistance.  More so in regard to the children because there are so many things which have now become my responsibility since the death of my brother and his wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is there anything else you would like to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTILE:</span> No, besides reiterating my request for help with the children and I also have an important request especially in regard to their death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a> I never received any kind of compensation because when I, or any satisfying response because even when I tried to enquire about why his wife was shot, we were just told that she wasn't working anywhere and I would like an investigation into their deaths so that these children can receive some kind of answer to the questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a> It is very difficult for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Mrs Bikishi?  Mrs Bikishi, your story is about Phindile Lhelhe Mbenge?  What was he to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MS BIKISHI:</span> He was my husband.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened to you?  He was also shot that day without you knowing why.  Where was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MS BIKISHI:</span> I was busy preparing his supper and he was sitting on the bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MS BIKISHI:</span> These people knocked on the door and I was</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>wondering who knocked and they - he went to open the door and they wanted to know why we were throwing at them and he wanted to know why should we throw stones at you, we don't know you and the one hit him with a sjambok and he fell on the bed and as he was getting up, the other one said, shoot at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a> Because I did not know them I came in and I asked them what are you doing?  The one said shoot this rubbish as well.   And they shot me in my leg, but I survived.  And my health has never been the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Your husband died there and then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MS BIKISHI:</span> Yes, he did.  I lost consciousness in the room and when I regained consciousness, I shook my husband, thinking he had also just fallen and lost consciousness the way I had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a> The police then came in and they said oh, dear, this person had passed away and they could see that I was confused and they decided to go and load me into a van or an ambulance or something and take me to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Were these the same policemen who were prosecuted in the matters of the gentlemen next to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MS BIKISHI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you institute a civil claim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MS BIKISHI:</span> No, but his family arrived that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You never received any compensation then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MS BIKISHI:</span> No, I did not.  I just received a little bit for my loss of blood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you have any request before this Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MS BIKISHI:</span> Yes, I do because I need help.  I am not well, I am ill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you receive any pension or disability grant or</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>anything from the Government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MS BIKISHI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you very much Mrs Bikishi.  Is that all you have to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MS BIKISHI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> I thank you all and I now hand you back to the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Peter, Mrs Mandile and Mrs Bikishi, we thank you.  If you were not residents of South Africa, we will not believe what you've just told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a> The cruelty of people who were behaving like animals.  We thank you for telling us your story today about this mini massacre.  We have noted your requests and we will forward them to the President.</p>
