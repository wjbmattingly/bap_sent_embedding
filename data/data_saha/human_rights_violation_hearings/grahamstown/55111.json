            "What happened was that Anele was just released from jail three days earlier because he used to break in and steal and so on, so my older brother was a policeman and he asked me if I was living with someone dirty here at home. When I asked him what he meant he said that a policeman was somebody evil, and he had friends who were living in the Tanke(?) area and my granny was living there too.  And three days after his release we went to visit my granny and then at 9 the following morning he wasn't back the following morning and towards half past nine that evening a man who owned a shop in Tanke came with four guys saying to tell us that a boy had been picked up naked in the park and that they had heard that this child lived here.\n My mother then we should go to this park, we got there, we found Anele naked and there was a lady who had asked him whose child he was and he had told her.  This lady then took him to her house and the ambulance was called in and it took him to hospital.  It was found that he had sustained injuries to his head, he was in hospital for two days, he passed away on the third day.\n   The explanation which we received from Anele while he was still in hospital was that he was taken by unknown people to him in the Tanke area when they kept him in a house all day saying that they were going to kill him. He said that they let him free that night but that whole day they assaulted him in every way possible, and he kept saying to them that he was not a policeman but that his brother was a policeman.  Their response was that they could not get hold of his brother, so the only way they could get to his brother was by assaulting him and family members. That was basically the explanation which Anele gave and he died two days after being admitted to hospital.\n He was still very young, Anele must have been about 15 years old, he was still very young but he was a very forward sort of curious child.",

When I got home Mbuyiselo was working at a shop in Xolani and when I got home he was off, I asked him for money and he gave me some.  He was a very generous kind person and he would try in all ways to help because he was the bread winner, so to speak.  He gave me money and I had this red car of my mine and I asked him where he was going and I offered to take him there by car and he said no he would walk.  I heard a noise in the next street and then I heard a whistle and I said to my mother that that is Mbuyiselo, and she said, please don't say that and that I should try and get the police.\n While I was trying to do that the police came and they said that Mbuyiselo was dead in Xolani.  I got into the police van and we went to Xolani Street and we got there and he had been burned.  He was pitch black the way he had burned and the one policeman was standing with him who had tried to douse the flames so that he did not burn out completely. I asked what had happened and I was told that he had been asking for forgiveness from the people and when I got to the mortuary the inquest or the post mortem showed that he had been shot in the neck and then he had been set alight, and I found that these boys were right in saying that lots of things were still going to happen to us at home.

It was even difficult to walk around there because even if you went into a shebeen or something there would be remarks that there was someone evil here and things like this, and much as I wanted to go to Xolani, I couldn't go and I said to my mum, I wanted to go to Xolani, and she said, rather don't go, you know what happened. And I mean as someone that loves liquor it was very difficult for me.\n When I went to the shebeen and got there, this lady said she'd like to see me, and she said that I should please take my things or she'll send them with children because children are saying this, that and the other. And I was still quite relaxed there but then I had to get out and jump over the fence and I was quite disappointed because I was enjoying myself there. I decided to just buy my stuff and go home but now what happened was once I remained at home and out of the community it was like I was aligning myself with what my brother was doing and I couldn't move around the community. And when I moved around there they'd say there was somebody dirty, there's somebody evil here and I was wondering what's so dirty about me? And I then took my car and went to Xolani that evening and when I got there my friends were very happy to see me and they gave me some money to go and buy some cigarettes and whatever we needed in town.  I went to town and I came back and I realised that I didn't have enough petrol but I didn't have money and I counted the money for cigarettes and I realised that I could possibly still get petrol from this. I asked my brother  if he didn't have an empty bottle for me to go and get petrol with in town, and he said he didn't.  I then found Sandile and said to him to him let's go and get some petrol.  When I got there Sandile dropped me and when I opened the petrol tank I felt a tap on my shoulder and I looked back and I thought, oh my God, I saw these guys who said they wanted to see me. I asked them what was up and they remarked that this car was bought with police money.  I denied it and said that I was working and bought the car with my money. On chap said that there was nothing wrong with me and the others told him that he was delaying them.  They took out a fire arm and there was a shot fired right next to me. I started to urinate in my pants and then this guy remarked that the gun is too small and they took out a much bigger gun and they started shooting and I thought, me I'm going to run now. I ran around the car several times and then I ran around the house and when I looked back, my car was on fire.\n I thought, my God where am I going to get another car, because I was unemployed.  I then got to the police station somehow and we came back and my car had been burned out, and it seems as if what happened was that there were some people who had been working there and had stripped the car of whatever they could use and I found that some kind of weird game was being played here.  The car was burned and these people who were responsible were arrested but they'd be released soon thereafter and when I'd go to the police station and enquire I would be told that the case had been withdrawn and I wanted to know how that was possible, I had not been informed? \n Long after my car had been burned I was walking down the road and I saw police up ahead. I'm policeman's brother, there was no need for me to be assaulted by the police and by the community, that's the last thing I expected. I was asked where I came from and before I could answer I was knocked with a shot gun on my head and I passed out and I was taken to hospital for stitches.  I laid a charge against that policeman and when I got to court I was told that the matter was being finalised and, in spite of me pointing out the policeman that had assaulted me I was told the matter was finalised and that's my story.",
