            "Mr Chairperson, the same, I will also read the statement of Mr Mtati to the Commission.  I Mzwandile Mtati, do hereby state as follows.  Number one, on or during 1986, the 23rd day of May, I was in the employ of the Alexandria Municipality in the capacity of a municipal policeman.  I also lived with my family in A Street, Alexandria, Kwaincubeli.  I was on duty that particular day on foot patrol in the township with Constable Mgene.  The situation at that time, during 1986, was very volatile due to the unstable political situation in the country.  Constable Mgene and myself decided to split up and go to our homes to check whether was everything in order as we constantly feared that our families would be targeted due to our affiliation with the establishment.  I went to my home where everything was still quiet.  My neighbour living about four homes from my own requested me to look after his home as he had to leave to fetch his coat at a friend's house.   When I went outside a while later I saw a burning tyre on the roof and that his home was set alight.  A crowd of people of about 2000 strong were standing outside his home throwing petrol bombs and stones at it.  Some of the people in the crowd saw me in my police uniform and started in my direction.  Someone threw a petrol bomb at me, but missed.  I shouted at them that they should stop or I would shoot, but they would not listen.  I started running away, but they followed me.  I again warned them that I would shoot if they continued.  A stone hit me on my body and I fell into a cement ditch lying on my back.  I took out my pistol and fired one shot into the crowd.\n I got up, tried to run away, but I came to a cement slab fence where I could go no further.  I was trapped.  The people started to surround me.  I had no option but to shoot again and I fired another fives shot into the crowd.  I believe that Constable Mgene also came back and fired shots into the crowd to disperse them.  A motor vehicle came down the street and the crowd started to break up.  Mgene came up to me and I requested him to call the police and the ambulance.  There was nothing else I could do to save my life as I believe that I would have been killed had I not acted as I did.  The same night my house was burned down.  Luckily, I had by then already vacated my home.  Signed, Mr M Mtati.  Thank you Mr Chairman.",
