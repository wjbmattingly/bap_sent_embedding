<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I was explaining to those who do not understand Xhosa that our proceedings here in Grahamstown will be conducted in Xhosa.  We apologise for starting late.  Our hearing was supposed to start at 09H15.  We were supposed to be having witnesses for the day, but because of the weather we found out that many people who made their statements to the Commission are not here today.  We will start with those who are here, and we will go back to those who are not here.  We hope they will be on their way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a> We want to give respect to people who made their statements to this Commission.  We would like you to stand up when they are coming in.  We would like everybody to stand up to give respect to those who are going to testify.  Thank you.  We will ask the Reverend to open this cession with a prayer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>THE HEARING IS OPENED WITH A PRAYER AND HYMN</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We thank you Minister for opening this hearing with a prayer in Grahamstown.  We thank what we heard in your scripture hearing as you mentioned that the truth is to be revealed to everybody, and I think our meeting here in Grahamstown, we are here to listen to what people are going to say to us, things that happened in the past, today we are going to hear them in front of everyone.  Thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a> We greet you all here in Grahamstown.  We apologise because it's cold today, but people from Grahamstown are used to this weather.  In the past two weeks we were in Pondoland, in Lusikisiki.  They told us there that we brought rain because when we arrived in Lusikisiki there was no rain but when we were there it rained.  People couldn't attend our hearings because of that.  We were happy because we brought rain to Pondoland.  Here in Grahamstown we brought cold.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a> We thank everyone who came here despite the weather to listen to what is going to be revealed.  I don't think you came here just to listen but you are here to help us to give respect to the people who are going to testify to this Commission.  I think that your presence here shows clearly that you are united with the victims, that you are supporting them in their pain that they experienced in the past.  They were fighting for everybody in this country, South Africa.  We thank you for coming here.  We will now start with our proceedings for the day.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a> We, as the Commission, we are disturbed when we see the victims.  They are opening their arms and their hearts to their perpetrators, and the perpetrators and those who benefitted in the apartheid system they are not like the victims, they are not opening their hearts to the victims.  In our hearings, as we are coming to the end, we started in April last year, from town-to-town we were very disturbed to see that those who are interested in the proceedings are the victims and the people who suffered due to the apartheid system.  Today we can see that there are people from the White community, they are here today and we thank them, and this shows that here in Grahamstown it is different from other towns.  We thank them for being here with us.   This shows that here in Grahamstown reconciliation is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a> We welcome you all, especially the Bishop here in Grahamstown, one of the heroes who fought for this country, who fought for the human rights.  We remember in Dimbaza where he was from the privileged community and he went to stay in Dimbaza with the people who were suffering, he became one of them.  We want to acknowledge as we are here in Grahamstown as a symbolic gesture for being here in this hearing today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a> I am not going to mention everybody here but we welcome you all with our open hearts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a> Our hearing in these three days we will be dealing with human rights violations here in Grahamstown and other regions.  I will hand over to Tiny Maya to introduce witnesses for the day.</p>

<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You always stayed here in Grahamstown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You made a request to appear in front of the Commission to tell us about what happened to you in 1986 is that correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Before you tell us what happened to you in 1986 can you please briefly give us, or tell us about what was the situation, what was happening here in Grahamstown in 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> In 1986 in Grahamstown the police came to my house, they were known as the Special Police.  They came to my house which was about quarter to nine.  They kicked the door.  We were all - our family was in the house at that time.  When my mother went to the door they kicked the door and together with her, Toto Mankayi together with his colleagues came in.  One of them was Tobile Nobebe.  They came to me and they beat me.  My mother tried to defend me.  They said they are going to shoot me.  They pointed a gun at my mother.  They took me outside because my mother couldn't defend me.  They didn't say what they were beating me for.  They took me outside, the assaulted me saying that they are going to shoot me and they are going to kill me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a> Toto Mankayi said that he wanted to kill ten people.  They were assaulting me all this time.  I managed to escape and I ran away to another street, End Street and I went to one house, no.4 in End Street.  At that time I saw that I was severely beaten up and I hid under a bed.  While I was still under a bed Tobile Nobebe came in.  He pulled me out because he asked from one little child where I was, and the child told him that I was under a bed.  He pulled me out.  He took out a gun and he shot me while I was lying down.  He dragged me into the street and he left me there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a> When he was going to shoot me for the second time children from that house they cried and they begged him not to kill me.  He left chasing these children together with his colleagues.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you receive medical treatment in hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> Yes. Nomangesi came to that street.  He took me to the Settlers Hospital.  In Settlers Hospital they transferred me to Port Elizabeth.  From Port Elizabeth they transferred me to Cape Town to Conradie Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I can see that you are in a wheelchair, were you injured on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> Yes I was shot on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> The people who assaulted you and shot you, who were with Tobile Nobebe and Toto Mankayi, were they arrested or did they appear in a court of law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> My sister hired a lawyer, Bonisile Sandi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What happened to that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> They went to testify in court but I was not there.  I heard that the case was dropped, Sandi told me, because I received certain money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you receive money due to your injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> Can you please repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were you paid by the government or by the Minister of Police as you were injured by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> I was paid.  I went to the lawyer and the lawyer received that money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you have a problem in mentioning how much were you paid?  How much were you paid due to your injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> I received R180 000 and I paid my lawyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you receive medical treatment now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What kind of treaatment do you get?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> I had bed sores, I'm still seeing a doctor in Settlers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> When you were giving your statement you had a request to the Commission to forward this request to the President, together with his team, do you remember what your request was?  Do you receive a pension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you have a request to the Commission as you have just explained your painful story to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> This question confuses me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What is your request to the Commission Mr Tom, if you have one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> The money I received was not enough.  I paid out lawyers and I paid for my wellbeing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all you want to say Mr Tom?  Do you want to add something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Tom.  Maybe you will be asked questions.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Sandi.  June Crichton?</p>

<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> I just have a couple of questions for you.  The police that broke into your house on that day, were they amaChaka, were they Municipal Police?</p>

<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And did I hear you correctly when you said that Mankayi said that he wanted to kill ten people that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Were you involved in a political organisation yourself, you were about 26 years old I think, were you involved in Greco(?)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> No I was at home at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> So you were not a student?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And as far as the payment to you was concerned was that payment made with your agreement, was the amount discussed with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> No it was not discussed with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Mr Tom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Rev Xundu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Sir I would like to ask you whether there are people who are dependant - do you have any dependants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> I am staying with my family, I don't have any children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Tom according to your view what made these people, what drove them to come to you and to shoot you and left you injured, what was the reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> I don't know Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there any political conflicts in the area at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> No I was not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you in a political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> No I was not a member of any political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When the case was in court what reason did they give for shooting you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOM:</span> I did not go to court, my lawyer went there to represent me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Tembinkosi Tom we thank you for appearing in front of the Commission.  I think that it is not only your testimony that affects us but the way you are, your situation, it affects us because now you are in a wheelchair, you cannot do anything for yourself.  You cannot support your family because of the two men who came to your house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a> We thank  you for coming in front of the Commission because maybe these people want to deny what you have because said.  They might say that all the testimonies are lies, but I think if they can come here and see you they will know that these things happened and they injured people, they murdered people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a> We heard your request and we will try to forward your request to the President of this country.  We promise that we will look into your request, but I want people to know that by appearing in front of the Commission they must not feel ashamed for their involvement in the struggle for liberation.  We are not a court of law because I know people used to deny everything in a court of law.  They would deny being involved in the struggle even if they were found with books of our liberation, they would deny everything because it was a disgrace at that time.  You told us that you were not involved in politics and I want to tell you that it was not a a to be involved in politics.  What we are looking at in this Commission is the cases of people who were injured due to political conflicts.  I don't want you to change your testimony, but I want to clarify that people are used to denying their involvement in political v.  Our main aim in this Commission is to find the truth, the whole truth.  We are not looking at the trial cases.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a> Thank you Mr Tom you may step down.</p>
