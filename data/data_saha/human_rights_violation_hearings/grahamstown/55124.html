<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What was the reason for his assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> It was a time when the police found you in the streets, they would assault you even if you did not do anything.</p>

<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did you lay a charge against him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Why did you not lay a charge against him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> I think we were not aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> As you are here today in this Commission, what would you like the Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> As Andile was a breadwinner, he was helping his mother to support the children, but my mother died and she</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>left the children alone.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> These children are Andile's sister.  Nobody is supporting them and nobody is paying for their education.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Would like us to help them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> In which standards are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> The other one has passed standard ten and the other one is doing standard six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Do you have anything else you want to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> No, there is nothing.  They are homeless if the Commission can help them to get a place to stay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairperson, I hand over to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sandi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  You said that you did not lay a charge against him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> No, we did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were you afraid or what was the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> Yes, we were afraid, because at that time it was difficult to go to the police to lay a charge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were the police protecting people in the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> No, the people were not protected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> In other words you mean that you were scared of the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> Yes, we were scared of the police in the community.  You would not go to the police station to ask the whereabouts of your family member, they would beat you up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you, Mam.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Nosakele, what is your relationship between yourself and Andile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> He is my cousin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is Andile's father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> He passed away when they were still young.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words, Andile was your responsibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you were giving your testimony, if I heard you correctly, you said this incident happened by the, the police were in a Hippo.  Where was this Hippo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> It was in Spikunye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What happened to this Hippo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What happened to, what do you think happened to Andile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> I am not sure, because they were chased away by the police and they ran away, but they managed to find Andile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Everybody who was with Andile was chased away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were these members of an organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said that this Hippo got an accident.  Was it in Dubane location?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are there any other questions?  June Crichton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Ma Kiva, can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  There is just one question I want to ask you.  There was a witness to this attack by the name of Zibangele.  Who is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> Yes, there was a witness by the name of Zibangele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And so, he saw the whole incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> No, but, because he ran away, he did not see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> But was it him that came to tell you about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MS KIVA:</span> Yes, he came to me saying that they were chased away by the Hippo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Alright, thank you very much.  Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Nosakele, we thank you for coming to this Commission.  It is very painful to see that your cousin was killed like a dog.  As you have already said that Tom said that the dog is dead.  It is very painful that after he was murdered there was no court case.  You did not get any compensation as a family.  What Tom said that Andile is dead, it is very painful.  We thank you for coming here on behalf of your sister to tell the story to the Commission in order to show that Andile was not a dog, he was a human-being.  We, as the Commission, we will investigate about this matter.  We will make sure that the death of Andile will not be like the death of an animal.  We will try to ask Tom questions if he is still alive in order to know what was happening at that time.  Maybe Tom will know that the death of a person is very painful, it is not like the death of a dog.  We thank you very much.  We will come back to you to get some clarity on certain issues.  Thank you.</p>
