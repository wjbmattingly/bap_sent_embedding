I slept.  His father was still alive then.  At sunrise I went to his room, found that he was not there and I sat and waited for him to return.  We all sat outside and waited.  Then a police car came driven by Putumeni and stopped in front of us, in front of our house and I was called.  Putumeni said something and left.  I was called back inside the house and told that Putumeni had come to tell us that Mtunyane had been shot dead.  He was my first born son.\n During the week a pile of clothes was brought to me.
