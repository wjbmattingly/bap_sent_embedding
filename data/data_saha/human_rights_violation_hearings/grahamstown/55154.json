We hope that this will remain in your mind that your mother sacrificed her life to protect you.\n I want to thank your father.  He said harsh words, but I think that he is an example of men, he is the father who showed that although his wife passed away he can raise his seven children.  I can see that this incident affected him.  As we are looking in his face it is clear that he was injured inside.  It is easy for us, as we are sitting here at the table to talk about reconciliation and forgiveness because we did not experience what you have experienced.  But we want to salute him and to give him respect because he lost his wife.  You were still very young.  He managed to try and raise you so that you can be where you are today.\n To you Mr Nombiba we would like to thank you.  You said something, I think it is very painful, that children did not tell us about their involvement.  We found that many parents are not aware whether their children died as heroes because at that time you couldn't go home and tell your parents what you were involved in.  You did not want them to expect you to be shot and to be in jail.  I think this is one of the important things in this Commission that old people like you, at last they would find the truth, the truth about the struggle of their children, because they did not tell them what was happening.  \n What is important to me is that maybe the Commission will give out a report that will help you to go to your children's graves, to talk to your children that you were not aware that they were fighting for their country, so that you can salute them.\n We thank you for your testimony.  We promise that what you have given us will be looked at, especially the two different views you mentioned about this reconciliation.  You may sit down, thank you.",
