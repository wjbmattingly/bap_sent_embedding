            "You have to make a statement about his incident, because what we have here is about yourself.  We will have a problem if we don't get Ndumasi's statement.  Thank you.\n I would like to thank the four of you, Mr Rwexu, Nomakhwezi Siko, Mrs Sandi and Tenjiwe Madinda.  These are very painful incidents.  \n I was saying that these incidents are very painful.  Starting with Mr Rwexu, it surprises us that you lost all your family, they have been burnt because there was someone who was working for the police.  You were only compensated, you only got R16 000-00.  Your house was burnt and three people were also killed who were inside.\n This shows that the Government of the day did not care because the police, whether we like it or not, were working for that Government.  The people did not like the police, the people were not fighting for the individual police, but they were fighting because the police were working for that Government.\n Some of the police lost their lives because they were protecting that Government, past Government.  It is surprising to us that when such a person lost three of his family members and the house was also burnt, the Government\nonly gave him R16 000-00.\n We are glad to hear this as the Commission, it confirms what we have already heard of incidents such as this.  In our minds as the people who were fighting against the Government of that day, we thought that such people get millions of rands.  We are surprised today to find out that this Government did not care for the people who were working under him.\n The Government was using this people but when they were in trouble because of working for him, as the police, the Government wouldn't care.  We would like to sympathise with you about what happened to you, about the scandal that happened to you.\n Nomakhwezi Siko has told us a terrible story, a painful story.  She managed to escape death.  We are glad that she is here today because as she was telling her story, she was supposed to be dead today together with Mrs Sandi by telling us about her daughter Nontyatyambo, who was also necklaced.\n Tenjiwe Madinda, telling us about her house which was burnt by people who were unknown.  These incidents are one of those incidents that were painful in the struggle of liberation.\n That the people who were fighting for the liberation, used such painful methods, they were burning people who were alleged to be informers, and who were alleged to be working with the police. \n We thank you for giving us this picture, it is a clear picture and it will remain in our minds.  People who are here today, who are listening to this story so that when we look back in our struggle, we also learn from the mistakes of the struggle.\n We have seen the mistakes that have happened in that struggle, we thank you for coming here because we did not want to listen to what the police have said but who have done to the people, such stories are part of our history.  We have noted your requests.  We are going to forward them to the President of this country who will decide what to do about your requests.\n For now, you may go back to your seats, thank you.",
