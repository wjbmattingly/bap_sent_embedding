<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Topsy Novakele Tembani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">TOPSY NOVAKELE TEMBANI:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you very much.  You may be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Over to you, June Crichton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Good afternoon Mrs Tembani, can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> I can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> We are going to talk, this afternoon, about Hermans "Pele" Zonwabele and he is your grandchild.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> I also have on my programme here two other names, Fetze Nomarwayi and Mzimkulu Mkele.  Were you going to speak about them as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> No, but if you, if you, if any questions were put to about them I would have been able to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mrs Tembani, we do not have any information about them on the statement so we will not be speaking about them then.  Thank you.  Right, now we can start then.  As I said previously, you are grandmother to Hermans "Pele" and you are here to tell us about his death in 1986.  He was a member of the Alexandria Youth Congress.  What age was at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> I have forgotten.  His documents are at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Was he at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> No, he had stopped school, he was a young man.  MS CRICHTON:  Can you tell us what happened on that day when he died, in your words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> There was shooting in the township area.  I was inside the house while the shooting was taking place and it was difficult for me to come out of the house because I was in the house alone.  After a while I went to peep out of the window and I saw an ambulance pass the house.  By this time all was quiet and I heard the following day when I was told by a young guy by the name of Joey, when I asked him if he had not seen "Pele" the previous day.  He told me that "Pele" was on ice and I was shocked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it possible for you to speak a bit louder, please, we cannot hear you very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> There was shooting that evening and I was afraid to come out of the house because I was alone at home.  After a while I saw an ambulance pass and I sat and waited until the morning, but I waited in vain.  The following day a guy by the name of Joey came and I asked him where "Pele" was and he said to me "Pele" is on ice, he was shot dead by these defence force police last night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mrs Tembani, can you tell me who this Joey was?  Was he a friend of "Pele's"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> Yes, he was a friend.  He was "Pele's" uncles son, a cousin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Alright, will you continue and tell us what happened at the post mortem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> They were all walking together and then they parted ways when they encountered the police.  These police  grabbed Joey and said that he should stay there and they followed "Pele".  When they got to the corner they found "Pele" and shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Did Joey tell you who it was who had shot your grandson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> Yes, he did.  He said it was Mbuta.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Is that the only name that he gave to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> No, it was Mbutana.  I wrote all these names down, but, because I was worried that I would forget them.  MS CRICHTON:  Alright, take your time.  We will wait for you.  Mrs Tembani, may I read these names out that you have written down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> Yes, you may go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> You have written here Mbutana Thembikos, Mzwandile Mthathi, Melekile Ncipa and ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> It is Ncipa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Ncipa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> Yes, it is Ncipa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you.  You are saying then that there was no court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> There was a court case, but nothing came of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Did you have an attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> No, there was no legal representative.  I do not think there was one.  No, there was not one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Was there any problem at the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> We buried them ourselves.  There was no problem, we buried them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mrs Tembani, you have been caring for or had been caring for this young man.  Where were his parents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> They were there, but they were unemployed.  They are no longer there.  He has no father, his mother cared for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And his mother, where is she now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> She has since gone to look for work.  She does not work there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mrs Tembani, the last question for you now.  You have come to the Commission, you have made the statement to the Commission, what were you expecting the Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> This Commission can help me in various ways, because he use to help me in lots of ways.  The two of us lived there together, there were two small children.  So the Commission can help me, because even my yard needs attention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mrs Tembani, is there anything other than that that you wish to say to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> I need help, that I be helped in some way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Are you not well, Mrs Tembani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> I have chest ailments.  I suffer respiratory problems from time to time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Is your testimony, therefore, complete now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Mrs Tembani.  I will hand you back to the Chairperson now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Tembani, in your statement you say you do not think that after he, this child died there was an inquest held.  Was there one held or not?  Was anyone charged with the death of this child or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you receive any compensation for his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> No, we did not receive anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Secondly, while you were giving your testimony before this Commission, even though you did not mention it in your statement, you say that you did not have a legal representative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you not have a legal representative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> I was very confused because when I enquired about this I did not understand what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The organisation of which this child was a member, did it not advise you as to what you could do, what your rights were since this child was killed in this fashion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> No, I did not go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Didn't anything happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you the head of the home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is your husband still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MRS TEMBANI:</span> No, he is deceased.  It was just this child and I and I am responsible for the home now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much, Mama, this is a very moving story and we have the deepest sympathy for you, because a lot of people your age do not understand the finer details of these processes as, and do not understand why your children had to die like animals and nothing was done to the perpetrators.  We trust that we, as a Commission, because we are here because of that, will try, by all means, to follow up on this matter and if there is anything which we can do, we will endeavour to do it and if we cannot, we  will have tried.  We know that elderly people, like yourself, will not know the intricacies of these problems, of these processes especially since you are the head of the house, you no longer have a husband.  We extend our deepest sympathy towards you.  Thank you very much.</p>
