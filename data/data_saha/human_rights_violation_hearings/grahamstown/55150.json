We are going to ask our investigating team to try and find out more about these peace-makers.\n Mamma Soya, we thank you for having come before this Commission to tell your story.  It also assists us in obtaining a complete picture of incidents which took place here in Grahamstown. It is possible that without your input we would have - there would have been some incomplete spaces in our story and as Mrs June Crichton said we would like to extend our sympathy to you with regards to the death of your husband.  We are going to attempt to investigate.  I do not know if we are going to ever be able to do what you asked us to do here, that being that we trace the ninth child and find out why you never received any compensation for the death of your husband.  We thank you for having come here.\n We are going to take a short recess, a 15 minute recess.  We will come back here after 15 minutes.\nHEARING ADJOURNS",
