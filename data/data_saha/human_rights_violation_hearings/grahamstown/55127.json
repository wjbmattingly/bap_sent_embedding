            "Chairperson and Committee Members, I am extremely disturbed by certain incidents where I was involved.  I Nombenqana Albert Koti are 46 years old, have made a sworn affidavit.  I am going to start with the incident regarding Mtandazeli Patrick Mdyogolo.\n In the above-mentioned year, 1984, although it is mentioned as 1985 here, I was in the employ of the South African Police as a reservist where I was from the 21st battalion of this army and we were based here in Grahamstown.\n At the time there were incidents of riots and I was with recruits where we were patrolling Raglan Road and\nAlbert Street because cars were being attacked in Rockland Road.  \n We were patrolling those areas.  As we were patrolling that street, we were called by Mr Junkin who had a shop in Albert Street, he stopped the van and when  he came to the van he reported to us that his shop had been broken into a few moments ago and that I should please take his children to James, a relative of his. \n We heard on the radio in the van, Sergeant Dekeda reporting to the police in New Street that a boy was found (indistinct), where he had been deceased, but had no wounds.  Sergeant Dekeda was making this report from New Street.\n Junkin was called and I said to him can you see it is bad in Joshua as well and also Makanaskop Bottle Store had been broken into and Junkin was surprised by this and he took these, this man's children to James.\n In the next few days I heard rumours that Mtandazeli Patrick Mdyogolo had been shot by me.  I went to Junkin there and then and asked him if he had also heard these rumours that I had shot Patrick Mdyogolo at Jole's.  He then said to me that if they wanted me at court, they wanted him at court that they should contact them and he provided a number because he was with me at this time of the incident, and other policemen were deployed at Jole's.\n We then went to court.  Captain Nel was in charge at the time, we went to court.  Although I don't see him here in Grahamstown any more, he had the occurrence book of the charge office because when we are deployed to places it is recorded in the occurrence book who is deployed where and I was recorded as having been deployed at Fingo and he gave the explanation at court, saying that Koti was working at\nFingo Village and he had not gone to the other area.\n I was then acquitted, found not guilty and set free to go.",

A White person had been shot dead in J-Street the day before where they were digging a trench, Mr Wewege,  he was working for the municipality and we heard information that this shotgun belonging to a policemen who had been set alight, Mr (indistinct), had been used in shooting this White man.\n And while we were here in J-Street this gun was rumoured to be in (indistinct) and it was to the north of Mr Sonwabe's yard in M.  We then stopped and discussed how we were going to go in, when children started shouting from L-Street.  \n At the time municipal police were called Amangundwana or rats and these children started shouting to us.  Hey you Amangundwana and I was driving the van at the time and my partner said to me let me go and look at these children that are shouting at us. \n He then crossed J-Street and K-Street and he passed a lady who was selling things in a certain yard, called Nothincia.  I then heard a shot and I got out of the van and ran that way immediately.\n And I found him coming out of a gate in K-Street which the lady, the previous witness testified about, which was\nfacing these children and I asked him what is the matter Khadi and he said I shot and children fell.\n I jumped passed him there and then over the fence and found the one laying near the door and others were scattered near the toilet, it was warm on that day and the child was wet with perspiration.  I then got an umbrella and said to, asked somebody to hold this umbrella over this child while I call some back up and also an ambulance.\n There is a lady that also shouted and wanted to know, Nombenqana, why did you shoot these children.  You are going to bring them back.  And this other lady said no he is not the one that shot them, that man shot them, the one that is smoking and Mpukumpuku was smoking a cigarette at the time.\n And they said that it is that man who is smoking.  I quickly went back to the van to call the other police Captain and asked them to call an ambulance ... (tape ends)  ... quickly came back and they were taken away.  Mpukumpuku was taken to the police station to go and submit a statement about this incident and we were charged, taken to court in connection with this incident and in court I said that I would like the court to go to the scene because there was a dispute over a bush which was near a toilet where the children were and Constable Rhade's statement said that he did not see beyond this bush.\n Back then this bush was still very small, it has since grown very much.  I think the one gentleman on the Committee was present there in that court where this matter was heard, where we went to go and look at the scene of the incident.\n The court went to the scene and measured the distance from where I was seated to where this little bush was and found that this bush was still very small at that stage and\nthat one could easily see people behind that bush.  And he passed away before this matter could be finalised.",
