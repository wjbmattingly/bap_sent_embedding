<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Why did he think the perpetrators were Amagoloda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS KOBESE:</span> He saw a brown van coming towards him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you Mr Kobese, we will investigate this matter.  We have been given this responsibility to investigate such matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a> Our Investigative Unit will try and investigate, but I would like to point out that it would be very difficult to investigate this but if we can get assistance from the community, if people can come forward, who are going to be</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>witnesses, for this case, or if there are people who applied for amnesty, who would help us, it would be easy because your husband did not see anyone, he did not even see the number plate of the van, but we will try to investigate this matter.  If we succeed we will tell you, but we will try even if we can fail, thank you Mrs Kobese.</p>
