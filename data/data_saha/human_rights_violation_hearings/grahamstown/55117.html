<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a> Yes, I still went to the hospital for treatment last Friday.</p>

<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> June Crichton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  You say that  you, Mr Duma, you say that you know Boyce from when you were</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>children together.  Did you ever talk about joining up with the police?  Did you discuss it ever and did he ever give you a reason as to why he did that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> No, he never gave me any reason for doing that.  He was part of the older group, he was amongst the older boys, he was not my peer.  He never gave me any reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And the second question is who is the person Nomonde Motinise, the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Nomonde Motinise was my brother's girlfriend, who was sentenced to 21 years.  I think she is teaching at Transkei now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> But she was a witness to the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, it happened before her because I was staying with her at the time, she was due to deliver any time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you very much Mr Duma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Ntsiki Sandi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> The lady you refer to, Nomonde, you say that you were staying with her, taking care of her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, because my brother was being harassed, the police were looking for him so he couldn't stay at home, and I had to stay with her, because she was pregnant and due to deliver at any time.  And when I was shot, I was on my way to the toilet.  She stayed close to where the people used to be set alight and the people were against them, and I was staying with her to ensure that she was not attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When did you drop out of school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> I dropped out of school in 1984, in standard nine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Sakumzi, thank you.  You gave your testimony very fast, at least we heard what you had to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a> We have taken note of what you have said here and perhaps our investigators will get in touch with you again</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>and see if they can get a statement from Mr Motinise.  For the moment, we thank you.</p>
