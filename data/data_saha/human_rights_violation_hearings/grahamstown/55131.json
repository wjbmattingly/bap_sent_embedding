We hope that those who were responsible for declaring the state of emergency, we hope that they are listening as you are talking.  One day they will come forward and ask for forgiveness.\n You have also reminded us that those days were dark days to many people who were fighting for liberation.   There were White people who were caring for us, there were very few, but today you have reminded us by mentioning Miss Priscilla Hall from Black Sash, you mentioned that she's the one who helped you.  You are reminding us that there were people although there were few, that these people took care of you.  It is very difficult today to find people who supported apartheid.  All of the people are against apartheid today, but we thank that people like Priscilla Hall at the past time they showed solidarity to people like you. We thank you for mentioning her name in your testimony.  We hope that she's listening. We want to pay our warmest tribute to her and to people like her that at that time they were amongst the privileged people but they identified themselves with the oppressed people.\n We thank you for your requests.
