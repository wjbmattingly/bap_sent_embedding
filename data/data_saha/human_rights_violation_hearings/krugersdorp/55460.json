            "Chairperson, I just want to emphasise a few points here. I have in my possession, and I think we need to understand this process very clearly, that we are asking all these questions. I mean, today with the people from Swanieville, out of the four people three identified once more the involvement of the police, in that massacre. I have a statement here from a policeman actually who also verifies that the internal stability unit was involved on that morning and identifies one particular policeman, that he recognises.  That he actually went after that unit, stopped the Casspir and nothing was done.\n Tomorrow's Sowetan carries an article again on this very massacre, and it was a massacre. I think we must be - although the people who have come forward today are not victims.  One person lost a family member.  But there were 26 people killed and over 100 people injured.  Was must not forget that.  \n The point I am trying to make is that we are investigating this massacre once again.  The opportunity is there for people on this particular massacre, people from the police force as well as members of the Inkatha Freedom Party, to come forward and apply for amnesty.  \n We have had in the last week the director-general of the South African Police Services clearly appealing once again to members within the services, to come forward and talk about what they were involved in.  Now the deadline for amnesty is 14 December, which isn't far away.  We also heard\nKRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n9 N VARA\nheard yesterday, and I don't want to be misinterpreted by what I am saying, we also heard yesterday about the killings that took place in Futsong. \n Now once again, in the last week we have had a statement from, if I can say that, from the African National Congress, who clarified their particular position and said at the Press conference that they have got processes where within each branch and in each region, if people want to go and talk about these issues, they will advise them accordingly.  I think people need to take advantage of that situation.\n I just want to emphasise that point again.  Thank you very much, Chairperson.",

We know you did all these things when we had the struggle, and I am sure now that we are trying to heal our land, you will still come forward to help your neighbours.  Some of the people who came here are known to you, some are your neighbours, some are relatives and I know they will need your support after they have been here today.\n We thank you very much for your attention and the interest that you have shown today.
