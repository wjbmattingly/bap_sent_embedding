It must be a terrible experience that you will be reliving.  We appreciate you coming to us.  We have heard a number of witnesses from Bekkersdal. If you could start off by telling us in 1990, more or less what the township was like, what was happening there, plus a little about what appears to be faction fighting or political wars, however you would want to\nKRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 MRS T M MONTSHIVA\ndescribe it.

            "In 1990 the location was a troubled one. There was a conflict between the ANC and the Azapos.  The others were calling others Varraras and I don't know what the other party called the other party.  The main issue was about the school.  The ANC members didn't want the children to attend school.  That was the main issue.\n One day, amongst all the trouble, it was in March, on a Friday, we were inside the house - my husband and myself. He sent our son to a boy called Patrick Msia to buy some cooldrink, that is his brother's son. He left Patrick Msia.  After some time he came back running.  He was shouting. I said to my husband there is a child shouting, it sounds like Pinda. When we went out, he went in.  There was a group of people. It was a big group of people.  My husband closed the gate and they demanded this boy.  They had all sorts of weapons, stones and pangas.  Pinda said they have already injured me.  My husband demanded that they go away, but they refused.  I looked to see who are these boys.  Then I realised that their leader was Thabela Syoke with two of his brothers, Bunny and Modibe. \n To my surprise there was also my brother's child amongst them.  He was in that crowd as well. I demanded to know why was Sipho there, but they didn't respond and they just left.\n It was hardly 20 minutes when two boys came. The other one is Mr Nkosi's son.  When they came back they said we are busy with this one, we want to take him to the hospital, the one who was injured.  \nKRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 MRS T M MONTSHIVA",

When we got there with my husband, we found the child with his head axed. He was axed all over his body as well.  We took him to the hospital. When we got there, one doctor said this man is very strong, he should have been dead by now.  They took him immediately to the intensive care unit where he stayed for nine days.  Thereafter he passed away.\n When we were supposed to bury him, we were not allowed, because they said that his body cannot enter the location. We had already made arrangements that he will be buried on the Saturday.  Even at the mortuary he told us that his body\nKRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 MRS T M MONTSHIVA\nis ready, but when he was supposed to be brought into the location, it was not allowed.  He was only brought in on Monday.  We made other arrangements again. We cooked again.  This is when we finally buried Mbuselo.\n Mbuselo, he was killed simply because of an ANC badge that he took from Sipho. He took this badge from Sipho, he wanted to know what is this nonsense that you have on.  Because he knew that Sipho is his cousin, and he destroyed this badge.  Sipho went to tell this to his friends, Thebelo and that's where the fight started, because Mbuselo did not belong to any political organisation.  That's how Mbuselo's matter went on.\n These people were arrested.  We were told that we will be called.  The policeman came to fetch us on that day, but we never appeared in court.  We only saw the matter in the newspapers. No policeman came to notify us. That was the last time we heard and these boys left. We never heard of them again.",

I only found out that whilst I was away he decided to ride on his bicycle.  I don't know whether he rode off to, but we picked up his body at the stadium.\n Whilst I was sitting at home in the afternoon, a gentleman known as Mogadi came to tell me.  He didn't tell me exactly what was happening. He just wanted to know that do I know whether that Dan has been injured. I told him no, I don't know. I didn't believe what he was saying.  He was still reluctant to tell me when the phone rang. I said he must please answer the phone. He did answer the phone.  I heard him saying that I am scared to tell her.

I was sitting on the mattress and I was told that these boys have arrived. I phoned five times to try and notify the policemen about this.  But they kept on asking me how many are these people.  Whilst I was still trying to phone the police, Robin Mgwana who was my relative was shot outside.  The tent was burnt.
