            "I'm Zondiwe Mtshalie.  It was on the 6th September on a Monday, my husband left home for work in the morning and we waited for his return to no avail.  We started panicking now because we didn't know his whereabouts. We only went to bed when it was late at night and he was not back yet.  The following morning we started panicking even more and wanted to go out and look for him.  We went to his company where he was working and when we got there he wasn't there either, he did not even show up.\n From there his brothers took me home and they left in search of him at the hospital and got back at one where we remained at home. That's when I discovered that my husband had died because my father in law came and sat right next to me, and he said to me, we've been defeated by life. I wondered as to what I could do.  \n They started explaining how they recovered his corps, how they went to the mortuary first and they did not see him and the police asked them when he was murdered or killed.  They explained that they were not even sure if he was killed because he had left for work the previous day and he did not come back home. The policeman helped them by taking them to some other parts of the mortuary but still they could not locate him.  As they were leaving the mortuary one of the brothers said he had a problem of going back home and giving up like that without recovering his corpse.  They went back to the mortuary and they saw one shoe but they could not recognise him because he was burned.  The only things that they could recognise were his shoes.  When they tried to take off his shoes they could tell from his feet that he is the one whom they were looking for.\n They left the mortuary and came home after recovering the corpse to tell me that they located him.  I was dark, I did not know where to start because the funeral arrangements had to take place now, and that's where we encountered the most difficult problem as we did not even have money for the expense.  What I will say here is that my husband was no buried by myself or by he brothers but the relatives a significant role. We had no money because this happened unexpectedly.  We were moved from one place to another and we wasted so much money in transferring from one place to another, so we encountered financial problems.  Even to this day we have the same problem because what I'm earning is peanuts.  I can't live with my children even today, I went back home to ask if they can't take them because I can't support my family ...(indistinct) and it is five years and the satisfaction they derived from a mother.",

I'll read from your statement here,\nWhen we moved to Panduka in preparation for going to Natal, we were labelled Ndwembe and that resulted in the death of my husband.\nCould you just explain what that means, we were labelled Ndwembe?",

Like so many of the accounts that we've heard, yours is also a very tragic account, especially the circumstances under which your husband was killed, that he was shot and then he was actually burned and in your statement you say that the only way that his brother was able to recognise him was because of the shoes, that the body was actually burned beyond recognition, and that's quite a hard thing to have to live through.  But one positive thing is that your statement and coming here, just shows us how this conflict had so many sides to it and ravaged so many .......(turn over tape)......which was the background to the decisions taken by whoever, that your husband should be killed, and that he disappears on his way to work.  So there's nothing we can say that can relieve your hurt and your pain, but from the side of the Commission, We're very grateful for you coming forward and sharing this with us and helping us to see just how terrible this conflict was and the costs involved.  Thank you very much Mrs Mstshali.",
