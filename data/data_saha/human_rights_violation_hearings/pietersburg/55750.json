While I was sitting there relaxing and the cows were grazing, I just saw something like a car, and when I looked at it I saw a group of people.  I stood up and they said to me I must just stand still.  After that I was very frightened and they said I mustn't mope.  They came to me and asked me for papers.  I asked what papers and they said they wanted papers of settlement.  I told them I didn't have those papers and they asked me why I didn't and why I was there when I didn't have such papers.  I told them it's because I didn't have money at the time, and they started beating me.\n I started to run away, I tried to but they beat me and others were screaming at me and shouting.  They beat me again and I ran away.  I ran to the field and I never came back.  At the same time the houses were burned.",
