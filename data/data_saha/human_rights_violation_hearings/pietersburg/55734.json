            "Mr Mahudu, you are going to take us back to a day many years ago, the 26th of May 1987 when you were arrested and taken to Burgersfort Prison and many things happened to you that day and afterwards.  May I ask you to tell us all about that?",

            "They took me from my work place, it was on the 26th of May 1987, there were two policemen, a white and black policeman, they asked for me, we went home, they searched my house and found documents which they said were illegal as well as the poems which I wrote. From there they took me to Burgersfort Prison. When we arrived there they told me they knew that I was in the Sekukuland Executive Organisation.  They asked me about the link between me and the one comrade who escaped.  Where was he sleeping, who was taking care of him, the AK 47.  They said we have hidden some AK 47's and we must give them up.\n The first evening they left and said they're going to fetch some other comrades in Phalaborwa and then we slept.  The following day they took me to Togoyang next to a river called Stubatza.  They put something black around my face, they undressed me and poured water on me, and I started feeling pains which I can't explain until they reached my private parts.  At the same time they were asking me repeatedly where the AK 47's are and whom I am on the executive of the organisation where, where do they stay and who are those people who left or came back from exile.  They repeated this while torturing me with electric shocks, then they stopped to give me a chance to think again, were the names which I gave them connected with the ones they know?  Then they repeated the torture and  repeated questioning for the next hour.\n From there they stopped, forced me to drink three or four cans of beer hoping to intoxicate me in order to make me spill the beans, but that did not happen. \n Next they used a rubber tube which blocked my nose and suffocated me for 10 to 20 minutes repeating their questions. After this they took me back to the police station where another group interrogated me upstairs.  They told me that if I don't cooperate with them, if the National Party is still in government, they would take me to Lydenburg Prison and I would stay there with common law prisoners as long as the National Party was in power. They said if I cooperated with them, they would buy me a car of my choice and a house which I want as well as going to any university I chose and they would pay me every month if I give them information. I was a freelance journalist at that time, they said I could go anywhere with my journalism and can infiltrate any organisation if I give them the information, all these things would be given to me for my cooperation.\n I didn't agree with them.  When the senior one left others came and threatened me that if I don't agree to work with them, I would be killed. They opened a safe of money and said that they would give me that money because my family is suffering and my family would live well after that. \n They then took me back to the cell and released me to go home. On the way they told me that I should know that where I stay and where I work there are a lot of informers who would inform them about my activities.  They dropped me at home.\n The following week they came back one evening and picked me up and took me to Burgersfort again.  They said that they had information that I was not at home, but this was not true.  They were just beating around the bushes and they took me back again. They came back again saying there were pamphlets in the village and asked me who could have distributed them. I said that I saw them but had no idea who distributed them.  Another group from Pretoria came with them when they returned to deal with me for not cooperating with them.  They told me their names but I can't remember them.  They told me that from that day, that they would send me to any university and promised me money if I cooperated with them, they were attempting to force me to be their informer, but I still refused.  They took me back home and two days later, one white man arrived on a motorbike and he found people at home with family members. There were no documents and I thought I was safe because if I did something they would know everything within a minute.  Towards June 16 we heard a rumour that they were going to detain us.  They wanted to know our plans for June 16 because it was very near and I told them that I know nothing. They put us together as a family and told the family that I don't want to cooperate with them, refusing a car, a house, a university offer, and appealed to my mother to discuss it with me. \n When they met me on the way hiking to work they would take me and harass me asking what it is that I wanted, why was I a member of the UDF.  When I got to work I found some of them there looking for me and I sat down with them. They wanted it to look to the public as if I worked with them.\n That is briefly what I want to say.",
