We ran away from the place and they were killing people but I was away from home, I was at work, and I went away because I couldn't even get water from that place. They used to sell water to me and I realised that I didn't have enough money so I decided that I should have work, be employed, and that was the time they decided to burn my house.",

            "Before my house was burned, this man just came to our place. We had been in the place before him under different chiefs.  When this chief arrived, in response to our questions, Maruteng people told us that we should know that they brought Manangani to us who will trouble us, so we were surprised by this kind of person.  We didn't bother at the time because we thought them to be just human like us.  When we were ploughing we were sometimes surprised because he would just take a place without letting us know.  He took our fields and he removed all our names and ploughed all our fields, so that it could all be one big field and he said he was the one who was in control and he made us pay money to plough our own fields.  We didn't like that, so when we were supposed to report there to our chiefs, they told us that we should just pay our for own fields because they were also surprised by the fact that the government didn't tell them anything about that. We paid for a long time but were not given the chance to plough our fields. He was the one who was ploughing our own fields, then we realised that we should leave the place and go and work for our keep and when I left the place, my houses were burned.  Everything inside, the furniture, I lost everything and there was no one to help because I was away from home. My wife and kids were also almost burned in the house but because God is great, they was able to run away.  They ran away because they saw people coming with litres of paraffin to burn our house in the evening.  In the morning people just found our place burned.\n Having lost everything I moved from the place and went to stay at Gangwana. I ran away at the time when my house and my furniture and my kids' place was burned. All the clothing of my three kids was burned in the house.  I was confused and frustrated but I'm thankful now because God helped me not to retaliate.  I used to think day and night how I could go and burn their houses and burn their houses too, I thought of burning all their houses but God helped me not to do it. None of the chiefs helped with anything. That man never came to my house to apologise.  Until today nothing has happened and I was relieved when I heard about this investigation and the Commission, and I went there thinking that they might help me and find those people because I want to see them, I want to know those people who did those things just want to find our who these people are, they are so terrible, they are just like witches who would kill even an infant. I was just an old man, I don't know what will actually relieve me. I would like the investigations to cover it all because I lost everything, I don't know if I will be compensated or what they are going to say when they appear before the Commission about all that they have done to me. I don't know what I can depend on, because this man never came to apologise.  He's acting as if he just killed an animal and you cannot apologise for killing an animal.  Up to this day he is resting with his family, having burned my and my son's property and the money that we paid him, he doesn't care about all that. I don't know what I can do, as I'm really broke.  When I see him I get angry and don't know how really to come to terms with this issue.",
