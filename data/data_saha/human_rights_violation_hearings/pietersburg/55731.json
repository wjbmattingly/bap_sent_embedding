            "In January 1986 my son left home.  It was early, before he left he washed his washing and he ironed. I only knew that he'd gone away to play with his friends.  I didn't have a problem with that, I thought he would come back at the time that he finds convenient for him.  Late we prepared the food and we put it aside so that when he comes home he would eat.\n The next day about nine or ten o'clock I got worried, but the previous night I had this dream while sleeping.  I heard a voice saying , \"Mama Mama\", and I woke up.  I went outside, I took a sjambok, I said I want to see this thing that's shouting Mama Mama outside.  I went outside but I couldn't find anything.  I went back into the house and I slept.\n At about nine of ten o'clock the following day a boy known as Normal Malak came and he said, \"I want to see whether my friend is here\". I said, \"No, where did you sleep?\"  He said, \"We went to Majas' place but the people were fighting for chairmanship, and we wanted to stop the fight but in that whole incident there was a white flag written in red letters, saying, let us negotiate, we are not fighting, we are the black people, let us understand each other\".  \n But these children who had left the place to go and resolve the issue, because there was a chairman elected who was above the others with points, and seemingly other people were against his chairmanship.  Then my son was attacked.  Shots went off and my son fell.  The people from Maja took a panga. You know when I looked at my son's head, it had wounds and the eighth one chopped his neck.  That's when I went to the hospital to see him.\n I was so surprised by the police at Lebowa, because they knew the incident and the police at Nebo knew this thing as well, but they took my child to Simanyana Hospital and when they arrived there no doctors were available.  It was afternoon and the doctors had already gone home, they took him to Jane Furs, they didn't alert the nurses that we have a patient here, they just chucked him on the stoep and they left him there.  My son was helped by the workers, they realised that this person must be injured.  They took him to the hospital.\n You know, during the weekends it's hard to get hold of doctors.  He slept there on Saturday, Sunday and the doctors came to see him on Monday but the doctor who was supposed to operate on him realised that he was dead.  The police shocked me because they didn't even come to my home to tell me that my son had died.  They only met a person on the road you know, I saw their car and I saw them speaking with this person.  This person was in a light yellow vehicle and the driver was Marisane Pasha, he was driving the Moshate car,  Then they said to him, \"Stop at that place, tell them that Solly died in the hospital\".\n After a few days a man called Mashego came and he said he was an investigator.  He wanted to know from me.  I couldn't bear his presence.  I chased him away, I said it doesn't help to come here and ask me questions because my son was killed by the police, and he was also chopped with the pangas. Go to Maja Village and ask them what I happened.  I said to him that I don't want to see him here anymore.  He left and he didn't come back.\n After that the police from Lebowa didn't take any action regarding Solly's matter until today. I went to the hospital because I wanted his death certificate.  They said the police at Nebo came to fetch his death certificate.  I said to them where is the bullet that you said was a police bullet.  They said that the police also took that bullet, and they said they could not do anything.  Up to this day I haven't heard anything.",
