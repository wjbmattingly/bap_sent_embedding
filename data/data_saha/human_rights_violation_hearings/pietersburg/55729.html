<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> You're coming to tell the Commission about what happened to you in 1986 about an assault which eventually led to you being in the wheelchair today.  I'd just like you to recount your story to us please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> In 1986 I was one of the ANC members at Radiwana.  At Ga Radiwana we as members of the ANC were trying to tell the people what the organisation is and what the organisation is all about. We called a meeting at Ga Radiwana and Ga Lamela to explain to them when we talk about the ANC what we are talking about.  While they were assembled in a hall at a school at a meeting to organised to explain to the people what politics are another group of ANC youths surprised us when they came singing freedom songs which were not familiar to us, because at that time we used to sing freedom songs that were not like these. We waited to see what would happen and what surprised us was that these youths had pangas, axes and knives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a> I don't know if I can mention our leader's name and we had arranged an agenda for the order of speakers but the group which entered did not regard did not regard us as ANC followers and presumed that we were going to talk about chieftainship.  They called themselves AZAPO and inside the hall they insisted that our leader should explain to the people what the meeting was about and one AZAPO member took the microphone from our leader.  We were not prepared to fight with them as they were the youth of the African National Congress and we came out of the hall and went home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a> The following day we were forced to assemble again to go and solve the problem.  While trying to do so, those people came again and started throwing stones on to the roof of the hall and you could see that they were prepared to fight.  We went out of the hall and didn't fight with them. We said to ourselves that they wanted to fight with us because they said we were not talking about the ANC but about something that affected chieftainship. </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a> Because there were problems in the village they came to me and said to me there are people who are my younger brothers and sisters, who I took to Mamonebi. When I came back from there in the afternoon, it was cloudy and misty and when I arrived in the village there was no one in the street.  I went home in order to find out what was happening.  We called the people from Marulaneng, Magane, ...(indistinct), we called them to come and explain to the people what we are doing.  When I arrived at home there was anther group which came from Marulaneng to the hall to go and explain to the people.  When we arrived at the hall we found that there were no people in the village, they had all gone into the mountains and the veld.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a> While we were sitting waiting for them to come and assemble, another group brandishing sticks arrived and we started running.  They caught me and hit me with an iron bar or the back of an axe and this put me into a wheel chair.  After that, one of the ANC guys who heard that I was injured took me to a shop in the village and from there he took me by car to Jane Furse, where I was told that I had to be transferred to Garankuwa hospital, where I stayed for three months. I realised there that I could not walk or use my hand.  I came back to stay at Jane Furse for a while using a wheel chair.  I went home after I was discharged where they said that I can't go and stay with people since I was paralysed.  I made little progress and they took me to Marishana where there was a priest, a Mr Mogau, a Zionist and I stayed there until 1984.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a> I was doing standard 8 when I got injured.  In 1984 I told the youth I don't know where I'm going to earn a living and asked them to call a meeting with the ANC to talk about my issue and if I can go to school. I was assisted by Divert Monakeng, Monakedi Colbert Marutad, Geddes Stamaga and Moswoso who contributed R50 each at the end of each month to pay a driver to take me to school.  I passed standards eight and nine.  When I started doing standard nine and people were asking for money from the ANC, one of them went to the South African Breweries which gave me R4 000 which was used for my schooling.  The man who started assisting me was my uncle to whom we paid R250 a month but he complained that the money was too little as he had his own children to maintain and needed an increase.  I was paying from the money I received as assistance and increased this to R300 but he disagreed and demanded R350. At the end of the year my money was finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a> In 1996 I stared staying with one of my friends who I could and can mot pay anything because I do not have the money, I only receive enough to buy food and pay R25 monthly for rent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Mr Baboa, in your statement you speak about the conflict between the ANC and AZAPO in 1986.  Do you mean the ANC or the UDF, because at that stage the ANC was still banned? Could you just speak openly about yourselves as the ANC or the UDF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> The UDF was a branch of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> And you say that the background to your story is this clash between the ANC and AZAPO but you also say that these other youth, went by that name, now when you say that, are you sure that this was AZAPO or who was this other group? Are you absolutely sure what the name of the other group was which you are speaking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Because you also said that this group was linked to one of the chiefs in the village, in your statement you speak about the chief of Radingwane, Moleme , was allied to or part of it?  You say this was really a front of the chieftancy.  The chieftancy was using the name of AZAPO to try and frustrate the activities of the ANC youth.  The chief of Ga Radingwane, Moleme who is still a chief to this day, was a member of AZAPO and all AZAPO members were supporters of the chieftaincy. Now I just wanted you to help us to make it quite clear, are you saying that this was AZAPO or are you saying that they pretended to be AZAPO or what exactly are you saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> On top of what you are asking me you asked me a very good question which I'm able to answer.  This group was AZAPO, the fact that we are talking about, that is chieftainship, this group of AZAPO, when they started fighting with the youth of the UDF were with their parents and went to burn the schools of Mila, so we felt that these people don't understand this problem as a youth problem but as a problem which affects the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> What was the background to this conflict, what was going on in your village, what was the fight about, do you have an idea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> As we were not a fighting people we wanted to let people know what the UDF is all about, the people who were fighting with us thought we were not talking about the UDF but about chieftainship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Thank you very much Mr Maboa, I'll see if there are any other Commissioners who want to ask you any further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MIRING:</span> Mr Moboa, thank you for your testimony.  Do you mind if I ask you a question or two about your own circumstance at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> My position is very difficult now.  In 1988 while I was still having problems, I realised that I'm grown up and was forced to meet a woman who I wanted to marry.  Because of my injuries there was nothing which I could do with her.  We are divorced now because there is nothing which I am giving her.  I'm left alone now.  My body is just a body, there is nothing that I can do with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MIRING:</span> There are no children that you have to care for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MIRING:</span> And can I ask about your studies, you are at school at the moment taking standard nine, and do you think after you have completed your schooling that you will be able to do work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> Yes I think I'll be able to work.  I would like to be in public administration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MIRING:</span> Do you think of going to university to further your studies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> Yes I want to go to university.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I'd like to take you back to those two conflicts between the two groups which you refer to as the ANC and AZAPO, and you said the AZAPO group and the community damaged schools.  What were they fighting for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> I think what made them to damage schools, they thought what we were doing in the ANC was something about chieftainship. They didn't actually know what our youth or our group was all about, because where I'm staying, we have two chiefs, we are all in the same place but we have two chiefs, so when we were growing up we used to go to the same school from both communities, to Radimela School.  The secondary school in our place comprised two communities and those people were forced to separate the schools.  One community therefore went to damage the school in the other community.  This all made us realise that the other people were fighting chieftancy and the ANC was only fighting for freedom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Are you saying that those people burned the schools?  What was the other community, were they the ANC or the UDF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> They said our organisation was not ANC, underground we were fighting chieftancy under one of the chiefs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You also say in your statement that these were the youths on the other side?  I don't understand when you say that it is the youth and if the community were realising that it's the youth, how did it come that the older people or the parents interfered in this conflict?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>How did the parents burn the schools?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> All this was caused because the AZAPO did not take what we were saying as an organisation thing.  The main thing they thought was that we wanted the other people who were supporting the other chief to come and support our chief, but that was not our main aim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> When you talk about the youth, I understand that you talk about the school kids or do you only talk about the other group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> The youth that I'm talking about are the school kids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What were these students calling themselves?  What was the name of their organisation at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> No most of the students didn't participate in our organisation.  They were just youth in the community, they had a certain name, but what surprised us is that in that organisation of the youth, parents were involved who were fighting the other community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Again I do not understand clearly the reason for the conflict between AZAPO and the ANC like you said in your statement that it was controlled by the youth and not the students. Knowing exactly that during this period in 1986, the conflict was mostly between students in COSAS and others in the AZAPO organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> In our community we called ourselves the Sekukuni Organisation.  The other organisation we only knew as AZAPO.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You didn't know their motives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> No we did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You said that the AZAPO organisation did not know your aims, they thought that it was about chieftainship, they were wrong, but tell us at the time what indeed were the aims of your organisation, of the Sekukune Youth Group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> Our aims as the Sekukune Youth Group, we realised that our youth were actually not understanding the aims of organisations, so our aimed were to teach and to educate the youth, their policies and the aims of the organisation. That was our main aim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When you arranged that meeting, you say the first meeting was arranged between the AZAPO and ANC or Sekukune Youth Organisations, the first time you went.  In your statement you say that it was arranged between ANC and AZAPO to call that meeting, that first meeting, to clarify issues about the youth related to the election of youth leadership.  Why, I mean what did you have in mind as a programme there? Tell us a bit about the programme, what did you intend to achieve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> As the Sekukune Youth Organisation in our whole community, we had this organisation in all those areas, Apel and Rangkwana, we had organisations and we realised that in our community we didn't have those organisations, so our leaders towards what the other organisations in other communities were doing, so they wanted to do the same in our community in Sekukune just like in Rangkwene and in Apel So we wanted the same thing in our community so that when we have problems as youth, we can solve them together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I don't think I have any questions outstanding.  Dr Ally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Mr Maboa, the other group who you say were AZAPO, were any of their members ever attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> No they were never attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I would like to ask you the last question.  If I understood you clearly, you thought the other group was AZAPO and you didn't know their aims.  Did I understand you clearly there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> This group calls themselves AZAPO even now, they still call themselves AZAPO.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Maboa. thank you for coming to us.  It's a very complex background that we have to look into. We appreciate your story, we know that you have a difficult time and difficult circumstances but we are impressed by the way in which you are furthering yourself in your studies and so on and we wish you well.  Thank you for coming to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOA:</span> Thank you.</p>
