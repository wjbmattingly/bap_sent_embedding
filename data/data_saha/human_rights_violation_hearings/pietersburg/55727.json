            "On the fifth of April 1986 I was in my house in Soweto and I received a call and I got a phone message where I was asked if I am Morenanna, and I said yes. They said they want to come and see me and when I asked them who they were they said that they are Lucky's friends and they are going to Moedeloos, and will see me in passing. I agreed but I was a little bit worried because when I came home in 1986 in March I expected my son to come home and he didn't come back.  Saturday, Sunday he didn't come and I decided not to go back to Jo'burg.  I went to Mukopane hospital and I didn't find him there.\n When I was supposed to call Pietersburg, I discovered that I don't have the Pietersburg hospital telephone number,  went to the police station and they said he wasn't there.   decided to leave, but I left a message that when he comes he must call me.  When I arrived there my heart was disturbed because I didn't know where he was.  In the afternoon I received a call and he said to me he was in Sishego and he was detained, he was arrested and was in the police station. I felt relieved because I realised that he was still alive. And then later I heard that he was dead.\n On the eighth of March I went to Seshego and they told me that he's no longer alive, and when I went there I discovered, it's true, he's dead. I found out he had been injured, his face was swollen, he had been really injured.\n On the sixth, it was on Sunday, we wanted to know who else was with him and I found out it was Phiri Gegane, Teredi Kegane, Galedi Tobejane, Jeffrey Mohale, Martha Balitswale, Baledi Silolo and someone else.  Actually they were all six, he was the seventh.  And they found them in one shebeen, they were sitting there drinking, except for him because he didn't drink liquor, he had a cool drink in front of him.  When they were sitting there eleven policemen came and said that these boys were having a comrade meeting, so they took them to the police station.  They hit them, they kicked them and they took the seven of them to the charge office.   They said that they released seven of them, and they said Jeffrey Mohale, Baledi Silolo, Phiri Gegane, John Teredi Gegane, these four were supposed to be dead, and he was just injured, but they couldn't really walk because they were really injured. \n One policeman by the name of Morare asked them if they knew what they were doing, they were killing the children. Then he said that he didn't even want to hear about them, all he wants is to see their corpses the next morning.\n From there he couldn't sleep, he had nightmares and blood was flowing all over.  Some of them couldn't even walk. Then they said, \"Your boy are stubborn, you write in the newspapers that we policemen are killing people\". On that newspaper it was written that police were killing people and they were accusing him of writing that. They took him to one police station which they called Stadium.  They assaulted my son and they told him they are going to kill him because he was reporting nonsense to people, telling them that the police are killing people.\n One of them by the name of Amos Rampedi kicked him in his private parts.  The next morning they discovered that he was dead.  Then Tobejane was admitted in Rankuwa.  After that they conducted an inquest.  In 1987 we needed lawyers to conduct the inquest and then we were told that Lucky was killed.  Dr Tlatla and Gadimeni and Richard Ramodiba, conducted a post mortem on Lucky's body and they discovered that he was killed by 41 sjambok marks, and afterwards the started conducting the inquest.\n In March 1988 they told us that police are now in Pieprus.  Mr Mabuza who was a magistrate, he found that the police were guilty because this kid was killed by 41 sjambok marks, and then the case was referred to a regional court.  We didn't even know that Lucky's case was on and we heard afterwards when sentence was supposed to be announced.  \nJeffrey Mohale's mother and myself went to the regional court and we discovered that the policemen were there and they were discharged.  They were found not guilty.\n We tried again to write to the Justice Department from 10th January 1994, we asked Mr Vosloo and he advised us that this case is an old case and therefore it will be difficult.  We explained to him that we have been trying to do this for a long time and Mr Boyd is the one who destroyed this case. They told us that this case been for over two years.  They kept on doing that.  When we were supposed to go to court, we were not told and they told us this case has no witnesses so it's going to be difficult.  They were found innocent. The witnesses were there but they were not called and that's how I see this whole case. I tried to work on it but nothing happened.",
