            "Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Thank you for this opportunity that you have given me, for me to be here today.  I thank the Commission for giving me the opportunity to talk about what I saw on the 7th of September 1992.\n We had a march that was emanating from King Williamstown, Victoria grounds.  We were going to Bisho.  It was at about 11 o'clock.  We went up using the main road towards King Williamstown to Bisho. On the way to King Williamstown on the sides there were police and soldiers of the Republic of South Africa.  I realised that they were guarding the White man's houses.  We walked on as a crowd.  When we were going towards Bisho I looked at my right side next to the Parliament and I saw Ciskean soldiers with arms.  We then walked on, and as I looked at the gravel road that was going towards the stadium I heard a sound that sounded like fireworks.  I was shocked and amazed as to what was happening.  I asked a comrade next to me, I said can you hear comrade what is happening?   He said, yes I can hear it.  What is it?  I looked at the stadium and I saw people falling.  It was almost like it is the stadium that is falling over.  There was a  ...(tape ends)   I tried to get up and I realised that my left leg would not cooperate.  I looked at it and it was swollen.  I had been shot at the knee.  I looked at my right hand.  I sensed something and I \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n1 P DUDA\njust saw a muscle hanging, bleeding.  I tried to get up yet again, but my leg would not allow me.  I called out to the comrades to help me.  As I was crying out another bullet was shot next to my head and I thought maybe I should just stay there.  I cried out, four comrades came towards me running.  Bullets were just being shot sporadically.  I cried out still because they left me there.  Six more came, they grabbed me and ran, there was a van parking on the tar road that was helping injured people.  They put me onto the bakkie. I was just so helpless, my strength was evading me.  \n When we got to the Grey Hospital it was just bloodshed everywhere.  People were lying on the floor on chairs.  We were helped initially.  I was put on a drip and the others as well. Those that were injured badly were taken to the hospital.  \n From Grey Hospital I got into an ambulance, it was two of us, another comrade that had been shot in the forehead, there was a big hole, bullet wound on the forehead.  The ambulance attendants tried to find out who it was.  He could not even speak.  They asked for his details, they could not get that from him.  He was too badly injured. \n We were taken to Frere Hospital.  I was taken to theatre.   I was in theatre until 3 a.m.  The next day it was clear that I was very ill.  I was taken to an intensive care ward.  I was given oxygen.  I thought that I was dying.  I was given treatment and things were better.",
