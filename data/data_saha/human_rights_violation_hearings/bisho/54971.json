            "We welcome all of you very warmly to this the second day of this special event hearing around the Bisho massacre.  As you all saw yesterday, we are going to have quite a few people who are going to come and give evidence and we want to welcome especially the former General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches, the Reverend Dr Frank Chicane.  Please stand so that they can see you.  We reserve the better for the last, his successor as General Secretary, Ms Hlophe Baum You may also rise so that they can see how beautiful you are.  \n We would also like to welcome the Chief of the Magagabe Clan.  Where are you sir?  I would like to ask you to rise as well so that everyone can see.  I was saying, I mean that you saw yesterday, we will have witnesses ranging from victims and survivors of the massacre and people who may have played a particular role in it.  We are expecting that Brigadier Gqozo may in fact come.  What I want to say, which I have kept saying throughout all our hearings ever since we started in April, that it is not always easy to give a fair hearing to everyone especially to people who may hold views that are different from your own.  \n We are learning and we have, I think, been conducting ourselves very admirably and so when that time comes it is important that whoever is a witness must be given the space and the freedom to be able to articulate their point of view and I will not permit any one to be intimidated by the remarks or the reactions of the audience.  You have up to now, conducted yourselves well and it will be a very important test when the time comes because others who may be alleged perpetrators might not come forward if the treatment they think they will get is one that makes them uncomfortable, and so we appeal to all of you that for the sake of this promotion of national unity and reconciliation, we should seek to give every one a fair chance and without further ado I will hand over to Commissioner Bongani Finca but before I do that let me introduce the panel.  \n The extreme right Mcebisi Xundu who is a member of the Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee based in our office in East London.  Tiny Maya, member of the Human Rights Violations Committee based in our East London office.\n Denzil Potgieter, Commissioner, member of the Human Rights Violations Committee and based in our office in Cape Town.  Bongani Finca, Commissioner, member of the Human Rights Violations Committee and convenor of our regional office based in East London.  Mapule Ramashala, Commissioner, member of the Reparations and Rehabilitation committee based in Cape Town.  Dumisa Ntsebeza, Commissioner, member of the Human Rights Violations committee and head of our investigative unit.  June Crichton, member of the Human Rights Violations committee who has recently returned and we are very glad that that has happened.  She is based in our office in East London.  Ntsike Sandi, committee member of the Human Rights Violations committee based in our office in East London.  Bongani Finca?",

            "Thank you Your Grace, I report on the matters that are going to come before the Commission today as follows.  The two matters that were held back yesterday because we couldn't complete our work, will be taken first.  Ncumisa Alice Kali appearing on the matter of Tobile Kali, murder, during the massacre and we will take Busisiwe Veronica Gwayi appearing on the matter of Thembinkosi Harold Billie, also murdered in the same massacre.  \n Your Grace we would request that we take those cases together with the first three cases in today's order.  Zolile Jonas appearing on behalf of himself for attempted murder and Sicelo Jonnie appearing also on behalf of himself, attempted murder.  And Paulina Thandeka Gibe appearing on behalf of himself, attempted murder.  Those are the first five cases that we will take at this stage and if we have time before tea, we will take the next five cases from 6 to 11 in our order and Your Grace I will announce that at that time, may I also report on the rest of the proceedings as per our schedule.  We have after tea, a submission which will primarily be focusing on the perspective of the former Ciskei government.  \n We are expecting as per the letter that was delivered to us yesterday, Brigadier Gqozo to lead that delegation from the former Ciskei government in making their submission.  We have confirmation that Mr M B Webb will be coming also.  At the time he was Minister of Foreign Affairs in Ciskei.  I confirm that we have already present in the hall, Mr P P Jacobs who was a Minister in the same government.  Mr Zantsi and Mr Ngcofe who were also ministers in the same government.  We are grateful indeed that they have come to give perspective of what that government thought about this massacre, before, when it happened and after it happened.\n We will then also be taking a submission from the South African Council of Churches and we are most grateful that the former general Secretary, Dr Frank Chicane, is here accompanied by the present General Secretary Ms Hlophe Baum whom we have already welcomed Your Grace.  They are going to be giving us a submission on a proposal that came from churches to try and avert the bloodshed that was eminent at the time, on this massacre.  We will take lunch and then the afternoon we will devote to listening to testimonies of victims.  I propose Your Grace that you accept that order?",

When the other people had already entered the stadium and we were still walking towards the stadium from your left, closer to the Radio Ciskei route.  When we were there we saw people entering the stadium.  We were hurrying and as we were getting closer an unexpected helicopter rose up.  It was yellow in colour.  As it rose up, it was facing towards the Parliament, towards Pick 'n Pay.  It then turned towards the Bisho police station.  As it was rising, people were running towards Bisho.  When it was up there we heard things like cricket sounds.  They were coming towards the Pick 'n Pay direction.  As they got closer we saw people running from the stadium towards us.  As we were coming closer to the gravel road we saw people falling ahead of us.  We then ran through the fence.  As we got closer we saw smoke.  As the smoke continued we saw a lot more people running towards us.  We then turned back and ran as well.  Next to me there was my colleague who was in standard seven with me.  As I was with him we parted in [indistinct].  All of a sudden something hit my thigh.  I did not realise that it's a bullet shot.  I thought it was teargas somehow but I thought that there is something definitely wrong with my leg.  As we tried to run towards Bisho, towards Red Cross, I came across marshals who were very shocked and I was shocked.  I then realised that I was shot and my leg was really not functioning at the time.  We were taken from there and we were treated by the Red Cross.  They put Savlon and used cotton wool on our wounds.  After that we were taken by ambulance to the Gray hospital.  At the Gray hospital they said that we must eat water with ice cubes.  We drank this water with ice cubes, I didn't know how it would help us.  They registered our names.  We went to a room where a nurse treated us.  They took out my bandage and put Savlon yet again on my wound and Betadine.  After they put Betadine on my wound they said I must come back the following day.  I went home and slept at home.  When I went back the next day they still put on Savlon and Betadine on my wound.  After they put on the Savlon and Betadine, they gave me a letter that I should take to Bisho and I said this is the very place where we were shot, I am not going there.  I then went home.

As I was entering the stadium, I was ahead of most of the crowd.  We heard sounds and we were told to lie on the ground and we started crawling.  As we were crawling I sensed in my knee that it's very difficult to walk.  When I looked, there was a hole.  I was shot in my left knee.  I tried to get up and run but my strength just left me.  As I was trying to crawl on my right arm, I realised that my left elbow is bleeding, it had been shot.  I crawled on my stomach and there was a helicopter hovering, a yellow helicopter hovering.  The most bullets were shot from the helicopter.  I saw a lot of cars, I think they were the leaders' cars.  I tried to go towards them and I put in my head but my body was behind.  The leaders put us in cars.  As we were driving outside the stadium there were doctors from the Red Cross, they helped us and they took us in Kombi's with GCJ registration to the Gray hospital.  When we got there we were given pain tablets and we took them.  We went for x-rays.  I was told that my - I was fractured and that I was to be taken to the Frere hospital.  We went to Frere, we got there after five.  Dr Watt told me to go to bed.  At 8 o'clock I was going to go to theatre.  I went to bed and I was operated on my knee and elbow.  They took out the bullets.  When I went back to bed -  I stayed at Frere hospital for five weeks.  On the last week, it was close to my examinations.  I requested that I be transferred closer to Queenstown so that I'm close to my teachers so that I can write my exams.  I stayed at the Frontier hospital for five weeks until I wrote my exams.  I wrote in bed because I had to get bed rest because my leg had not healed.  I wrote my exams and finished.  I went back to Frere hospital.  I was checked and I was discharged on the 19th November.",

I was there for about 20 to 30 minutes and there were bullet shots, it was, I couldn't see properly because of the teargas smoke.  I was there and I was joined by many others.  After a long time I then heard, I was also feeling dizzy at the time and feeling very weak.  I couldn't even stand.  Then some comrades took me into a van that had taken all day injured people.  Whilst I was there we were taking more people, even the dead bodies and I was still very dizzy and I could hear that there were some who had died and I just couldn't believe it and I wanted to indicate that I was still alive so I decided to come out of the bodies that were on top of me to show that I was still very much alive.

I confirm that yesterday morning Brigadier Gqozo received your invitation to attend today's hearing and as you are well aware, he responded to yourselves and accepted such invitation.  As his legal council, pursuant to his acceptance of your invitation and his willingness to co-operate with the Commission I embarked on consultations with Brigadier Gqozo.  It became abundantly apparent to me during such consultations that Brigadier Gqozo was not in a fit position to make a meaningful contribution during consultation, to enable me to advise him as to his legal rights or to prepare him for today's hearing.  He suffered from a lack of concentration, confusion and extreme fatigue.  \n Yesterday I consulted with Doctor Elizabeth Weiss who is a state psychiatrist, who confirmed that Brigadier Gqozo's behaviour is consistent with the major depressive episode from which he is presently suffering and in this regard, I refer to the affidavit of Doctor Weiss who examined Brigadier Gqozo, which affidavit is annexed to the notice of application served on the Commission earlier this morning.  I place on record that Brigadier Gqozo is presently receiving treatment for his condition under the care and supervision of Doctor Weiss.  Accordingly, it is for these reasons that I humbly request that the contribution of Brigadier Gqozo to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission be deferred until such time as he is in a fit position to do so.\n I shall ensure that the Commission is kept abreast of Brigadier Gqozo's condition.   May I take this opportunity further Your Grace, Mr Chairman, Commissioners, to apologise for any inconvenience caused to this Commission.

            "Okay, thank you for that clarification.  In that case, Your Grace, Honourable Chairperson, members of the Commission, I was invited to testify by the Right Reverend Bongani Finca before your Commission as to the role played by the then government of Ciskei at the time of the march to Bisho.\n I have explained to the Honourable Commissioner that I was retained by the government of Ciskei at the time in my capacity as an attorney.  As such, I was concerned about professional privilege that exists between attorney and client.  In addition, I further explained that on the fateful day of the tragedy I was attending a meeting in Pretoria and that any knowledge which I might have had about the march would have been hearsay and would lack the credibility of a witness present on the scene.\n The Honourable Commissioner Finca telephoned me in response to my letter and advised that I should nevertheless testify as the Commission sought to understand the perspective of the Ciskei authorities and how the authorities saw the African National Congress at the time.  I accordingly expressed what I understand the Ciskei government's position to have been and I respectfully ask the Commission to note that this was a position at a specific time in history, it was not necessarily my own position, and indeed my advice was not always followed.\n Nevertheless subsequent events such as participation in the multiparty negotiating process, a member of the ten-man planning secretariat, the Transitional Executive Council will have identified some of my personal positions which I do not however, believe to be at issue at this Commission but which I am happy to record, found the support in some ways at the Constitutional Court last week.  The relationship between the African National Congress and the government of Ciskei had appeared to me to be cordial in those months shortly after the expulsion of Mr Lenox Sebe in 1990.\n Regrettably this relationship soured through differences of opinion and management styles and frequent outbursts of a mutually critical nature became the order of the day.  The Ciskei government which I sincerely believed wanted to be a benevolent government, was literally caught on the one hand between the Nationalist Party government  [i.e. the Pretoria regime]  which communicated manipulatively through Foreign Affairs Minister, Pik Botha and who held the purse strings, and on the other hand between the liberation movements determined to destabilise until democracy was achieved.\n Chairperson, Honourable Commissioners, at that time there was so much misinformation being disseminated, what with the National Intelligence from South Africa, South African Military Intelligence, Ciskei Intelligence Services and a plethora of confidential aides employed to sell false information and mislead.  Indeed in retrospect sir, the cross-fertilisation of mystery and intrigue would have done justice to a best selling suspense novel.  At the time however, it was serious business, conveyed with urgency and clandestine calls and covert messages.\n Agents of the various intelligence services, each with a different mission in the total political activity, proliferated Ciskei government with information which could only have ended up in confrontation between the authorities and the African National Congress.  These influences through the wholesale dissemination of misinformation, exacerbated the tension between all the groups.  With the extremely manipulative South African government which became less and less supportive with its devious methods to mischievously undermine the Ciskei government.\n Simultaneously Sir, the liberation movement strategically would keep government busy with demands, strikes, threats, boycotts, stay-aways and the like.  All the while it is my belief that my client sought to achieve the best possible solution for the people.  It made decisions, it provided concessions, it assisted with taxes, it had numerous development programmes, it abolished the death penalty, it produced and passed the first real Bill of Rights in Southern Africa.  It past through consultation and a creative and innovative Labour Relations Dispensation, and generally speaking was focused in trying to create work opportunities for the local people.\n Importantly Commissioners, it participated in every initiative in a lawful and responsible manner to bring about peaceful change.  Chairperson, I trust that I have set the scene.  Undermining, manipulation, misinformation from the Pretoria Regime which was in financial control, and strategic confrontation from the liberation movements desperate for democracy.  \n The march was planned and advertised.  From the Victoria grounds, King Williams Town to Bisho.  The purpose was declared by the marchers and leaders of the march.  As far as I know not legitimate request was sought to obtain from the Ciskei authorities for permission for the march to go ahead on Ciskei soil.  These requirements were consistent with those requirements throughout the greater South Africa and we are not just a Ciskei aberration.  Legal advisors were called in to ascertain the proper legal processes to be followed.\n For the safety of the people, it was considered critical that there be no unauthorised demonstration.  It was not so long ago that the demise of the Sebe error had brought with it a euphoria which manifested itself in wholesale destruction and vandalism.  The Ciskei government was determined to prevent and avoid any hysteria which would overflow into violence and anarchy.  The posters and promises in speeches identified the goal as the removal of the Ciskei government and the destruction of Bisho.  The legal advisors, Chairperson, in order to be proactive, addressed the ANC executive and advised the African National Congress that if it marched into Ciskei without the requisite authority, such march would be illegal and the ANC would then be accountable for the due process of law enforcement.\n Application was made and ultimately the ANC approached the Supreme Court to request the magistrate to rule on the matter.  The irony is that when the magistrate did make his ruling at the behest of the Supreme Court, the very organisation which had obtained the order, failed to observe it.  It is common cause that the march was to be limited to the stadium.  It is my view that the magistrate, under immense pressure and faced with protracted acrimonious debate, made a brave ruling.  The Ciskei government had been made aware publicly and through its sources that the invasion of Bisho, the removal of the Ciskei government and the assumption of power were but three objectives of the march.\n Newspaper reports told of plans to replace government.  Information sources listed the names of the new Head of State and responsible ministers.  Rumour had it that most of the buildings here were to be set alight so that Bisho would be raised to the ground.  Frightening stories were prevalent and the mood of the Ciskei government, which included three high profile seconded ministers, absent here today, was to prevent an invasion, destruction, and insurrection.\n On the morning of the march when I left to go to Pretoria, I felt that we had done everything possible from a legal point of view, to prevent a tragedy.  Indeed it appeared that the magistrate had shown excellent wisdom to direct the marchers to the stadium and back.  In order that the demonstration could proceed but would be contained and peaceful.  The events later that day showed a disregard for the rule of law with tragic consequences.\n In conclusion, Chairperson, Honourable Commissioners, I need to record in trying to sketch a perspective, that in the last few days prior to the march, there were numerous representations made to change the attitude of the Ciskei authorities.  Clergy of national profile, Ministers from the Republic of South Africa, friends, politicians and councillors tried to persuade the authorities.  ... end of Tape 3, side A ... \n However no one would guarantee that the information about violence and insurrection, that the threats of destruction, that the promise to take control of government would not materialise and that the march would in fact remain peaceful.\n Tragically, history has proved that the Ciskei authority's understanding of the purpose of the march was indeed correct and that the promise of a peaceful, controlled march could not be sustained.  Your Grace, Commissioners, it was on Sunday night during my quiet time that I became aware of the awesome task which you have in the reconciliation process.  This community, and I include myself as one of them, have agonised at the dreadful results of that march.  I pray that what I have said will shed just a little light on the conflicting conditions which prevailed at that time.  \n I ask not for justification but that when you consider your deliberations at the end of this session, you consider the legal implications which prevailed.  There is also my sincere hope that the testimony which I offer today may assist this Commission in its arduous task of establishing the truth and bringing reconciliation to our people.  I thank you.",

It is exactly what he has said, you know there was a high strong point of departure between the then Ciskei government and the ANC.\n Now you of course I suppose because of manipulation in the dark because Ciskei was between the ANC and the RSA and the RSA was a domineering power which you have if you serve it you tow the line here and there otherwise they hold the purse.  \n Now many delegations came up to the then government, eminent ministers of religion, a Doctor Geldenhuys who was a peace monitoring officer and many others trying to persuade the government to allow the marchers to come up as far as Bisho.  But the government was adamant because the government then feared that should they come to Bisho, what we think is that they may usurp everything as the placards were saying that.  That was the fear now from this side of the government.\n Now on the day of this, unfortunately I was with him in Pretoria.  I cannot describe it very graphically the 7th September.  On that day we attended a meeting on federalism but from what we heard, when the marchers went into the stadium, when a group of them went through a hole in the fence of the stadium and rushed towards the area where the soldiers had some kind of a road-block for themselves, then it is then that the shooting took place but we couldn't get the answer who gave the direction or the instruction to do this  [indistinct].\n Then after that day then there was a commotion, a high tension in the area.  People's houses were burnt down, some of the security forces were removed from their houses to be housed at Mount Cook.  That's my verbal contribution Your Excellency.",

I gave my staff permission, they asked for permission quite early and I gave them permission, I said since I have got to go via Fort Beaufort I will follow.\n So unfortunately the Indian, Mr Ragavan, whose transport I used to commute from Fort Beaufort to Hill Town was not available at the time so that I had to go home and not come anywhere into Bisho.  \n When I got home my wife told me that in the news at 1 o'clock there was this announcement that all was not well at Bisho, so that the first that I got to know of what was taking place was what I got from my wife when I got home on the 7th September and I do hope that - I only came onto the government in February 1993, 1st February.\n So that the goings on before, I was not aware of.  It is only when I came in and even then the matter was now history so that I cannot contribute materially about what took place.  But Mr Chairman, I do believe that the happenings of 7th September emanate from the event which culminated in the establishment of a Ciskei self-government.  \n In 1972 when Koornhoff and De Wet Nell dug the first soil here saying they are making self-government possible and it will interest the Commission to know that those of us who were  [indistinct]  then, stood up vehemently and opposed this.  We said we want to remain as part of South Africa and I really cursed the day that the Ciskeians decided and labelled some of us as traitors because we could not accept the concept of self-government.  And from then during the Sebe regime we were sidelined because we believed we were part of South Africa and this dividing of South Africa into states was not conducive for us so that, Mr Chairman, I was in no way connected with it but my views which are known even to the Supreme Court in Grahamstown when I contested the legality of the elections which were held to set up this homeland.

As we know, I am one of those people that were present when there was a coup in 1990.  At that time after this happened, there was great joy amongst the people, some were saying this is happening and it is good.  The late Mr Sebe is removed because of us and the soldiers were saying it is because of them that Mr Sebe was deposed.\n Everybody who was in Ciskei at the time knows what was happening especially before 1990.  They know also what happened on that particular day of the 4th March 1990.  As things went on and we were working with people, things were going well but there were a lot of people who had grievances who did not agree with the way the government was doing things but they did not speak freely or outwardly, but most voices were saying you helped us, Brigadier Gqozo.  Things continued in that manner, these people with different opinions but it was clear that most people were pleased because we were even going to...\n There were a lot of people who came to the offices when I was there.

These were Ciskeian citizens that were uttering these statements, elderly people.  Brigadier Gqozo, you are letting young people lead us, do you know what is going on in the villages?  There is no order in the villages.  There is discordance.  There is continuous discordance.  The side that was constantly asking why Brigadier Gqozo was letting us be led by young people were not saying anything but there were vibes that they did not want this.  \n They gave me stares when I walked home, when I was home and some of them who did have the guts to ask me what we were doing.  I am very outspoken and I would say to them you are the ones who feel this.  If you come and tell me as an individual, there is nothing I can do, you must forget it.  What you must do, get up, make noise so that there will be direction but if you just sit at home and catch us an individuals and ask us what is happening, nothing will happen, there will be no progress.  It went on like that.  There were a lot that we saw that was going on in the village.\n People started killing each other in the villages.  Other people came.  When Brigadier Gqozo formed an organisation so that we could also be heard, this organisation was called ADM, this party.  People started killing each other in Ciskei.  People really started killing each other.  People were dying.  It is these two parties that were killing each other.  It was the African National Congress against the ADM.  The PAC also came to our offices asking Brigadier Gqozo what is happening.  Brigadier Gqozo said that they did not count and they were told, they said they came as the PAC party but they were turned away.\n There was the ADM and the ANC.  Those were the major parties that were fighting against each other.  People died.  Then the South African government intervened.  I went a lot with Ministers to the South African government.  There was a day when it was clear that we were working with the ANC, I remember when we were going to a meeting which Brigadier Gqozo was meant to attend and Minister Pik Botha but they could not go to that meeting even though they were waiting for him.  I led the delegation then because Brigadier Gqozo could not make it.\n I am trying to form a picture.  I was then asked what is going on in Ciskei.  I said there is no problem there.  They asked me if I know Mr George, I said yes.  I told them there is no problem.  We are working with people, we even give them vehicles, they are using them.  There is absolutely no problem.  Good he said.  I don't know what else they said beyond that with Brigadier Gqozo.  \n There are not too many meetings that I attended where there was, that there was discussions with the then Minister Pik Botha.  We got there all prepared, the delegation from South Africa was not meant to meet all of us.  We were supposed to meet at tea.  I told Brigadier Gqozo that I don't like the way things are going, that we are not fully involved.  His deputy Mr Schoeman insisted that he wants to see Brigadier Gqozo on his own.  It was difficult that day.  I then entered to hear what was going on.  It was very difficult, Mr Schoeman didn't know what to do.  He didn't want me to be present.\n Brigadier Gqozo then said you can talk in his presence.  I don't really know what was going on.  I just want to say what I know.  That kind of situation carried on with the discordance between the African National Congress and the ADM.  There was then an intelligence that was constructed.  It was clear that this discordance was going to cause trouble but sometimes when something is happening around you, you don't recognise it or acknowledge it.  It is at a distance that you can be objective and see what is going on.\n We just realised the magnitude when we looked from a distance and we were told by other people what was going on.  It was very difficult at the time.  The African National Congress wanted things done in a particular way and there are other people, the ADM that wanted things to be done in another way altogether.  They did not come out in the open to say exactly what it is they wanted.  All they said was that they have been intimidated.  I pleaded with them to try and talk in the open.\n Going back to the 4th March, or rather 7th September, before that as a security council, we used to get reports as to what is going on in Ciskei.  Intelligence reports, security reports, army reports, we would then ascertain what is best to take it to the City Council as a constructive report.  There were a lot of things that were being said as to what was going to happen on the 7th September.\n On the 7th September there was a rumour that the Ciskeian government, there was going to be a coup, that the MK was going to take over, that it is going to take all of us and take us where we don't want to be taken.  Whether this was true or not but there were such rumours.  This was a security report.  We didn't know where it came from, we didn't have sources but these are the reports that came to us.  They came to us and told us that it is a fact.  In my memory as I remember these things.  In my memory the march was not committed to pursue, to continue because there was these rumours that there was going to be a coup.\n There were certain people that were provoking us but we were told by the leadership that these were not members of the ANC.  Some would go to marches with bad intentions and wanting revenge.  We then asked them that they should look at these things.  We asked the magistrate to consider these things as well.  At the time we were at the offices when the march was going on.  It is the soldiers that prepared how this march was going to work and where the soldiers were going to be deployed.  We then wanted to know what preparations the soldiers had made, that people were going to loot and that Bisho was in danger.\n They then told us what was going to happen, where the soldiers were going to be deployed and the police.  They told us how they were going to prevent people from going to Bisho and that there were going to be people standing at the fence where there was a gap.  We could see all this from the office and there were a lot of people.  As we were watching, there were people that did not enter into the stadium.  We could not see properly, we just heard shots and people were falling over.  We were at the offices at the time.  That is how people died, from my perspective and people were injured.\n After that the government talked about this incident.  We then thought that an investigation should be made and a Commission was set up and there were results.  That is all I can say about that day.",

So we moved on with the march and we went through the gate but just before I get into the yard I waited outside talking to one marshal that I knew.  As I was talking we saw a helicopter flying out and then thereafter I didn't know what happened.  I just saw people coming out of the stadium.  They were running and I heard some gunshots.  In fact I wasn't even sure of the sounds, what sound it was.  It was rain of whatever and then I saw a lot of people running away.  Just before I turned, watching and looking at what was happening and I was facing the police station and I could see that there were people on the grandstand of the stadium watching and it was an extremely hot day, so I just felt something hitting my leg and I fell down but I struggled and jumped up.  I was dressed in this very attire I'm wearing and I tried to cover my face but I noticed that I couldn't use my leg and I could hear the noise, it was continuing, so as I was running there was an instruction that we should crawl, so I rolled and I became dizzy but I felt this was of no help to me.  Then there was shooting on the way then I tried to run away then I rolled and I went into the forest and I drank water and I found that there was blood in my shoes and I, the people were still running and I could see that there was war.  So I ran towards the forest and met a certain man and asked for assistance and this man decided to leave me as soon as this helicopter came back, so I decided to run as fast as I could so I met some men who were soldiers there and they asked what was happening.  Then they said there was nothing wrong.  Then one of them shot me at the back, then I decided to tell them that I was injured.  Then he instructed me to lie on my stomach.  Then as I was resisting, then a policeman came.  It was a white man and he was armed.  Then I lifted my hands up and I said to him I've been shot already and he held me and only to find that these were members of the Red Cross and they took me into a van together with another one and they left the door of the van opened and they drove to a certain field and put us there and I was so scared and my leg was getting swollen.  Then a certain lady who I think was a member of the ANC gave me some tablets to swallow and as I was still intending to run away, I saw some soldiers who were on guard and then there was this helicopter that was hovering over the, all the time.  Then as I was trying to run away I was held and I was asked to lie down.  Then they promised to call for an ambulance which came and was sent to Gray Hospital and it was full there.  I couldn't trust anyone and I decided to hide under a bed.  Then as we were getting in I could see some bodies that were covered with white sheets and I was worried about my family and didn't know what to do.  So as soon as I got discharged from hospital - Where exactly did you get help? ---  I got, at Gray Hospital they just stitched my wound and later the day they referred me to East London which is my home.  That is where I was admitted for a day and in the morning I was attended to by the doctor and I was discharged because the hospital was full.  So I went to look for my relatives and I was followed once more by the soldiers and I was afraid and I tried to escape.  I ran to the forest and I was helped by other men there.",

I was going to say what grieves me about these incidents is that when somebody loses a family member, being sent up and down, not knowing whether, if the member of your family is at hospital or has already died.  You go up and down until you find out from newspapers.\n This causes great grief but you are special people because even though we've gone through all these experiences we can, we are even able to love if somebody cracks a joke.  We would not be implying that we've taken lightly what has happened to us but it's a God given gift that we are able to laugh even though we are so grieved.\n It's God's way of making lighter what is so heavy in our hearts.  We thank God for this gift.  We also thank you that in your pain you are able to come here without bitterness and now as we heard that as one of you testified that the perpetrators of this violence should come to the Truth Commission so that there is reconciliation.  We thank you very much.  Knowing as we said that most people that went through the most pain was the youth.  The blood that was shed was watering the grounds of freedom, such that all that has happened did not happen in vain.\n Today we are able to see this nation as a people that is in freedom.  We thank you very much.  We know that your pain is not lighter but I'd like you to know that you talked to people who empathise with you.  May the Lord strengthen you and comfort you and may His Holy Spirit be the bandage of your wounds.  We have listened to your requests.  We will try our best to help you.  Thank you.\n We are going to adjourn until 9 o'clock.  Commissioner Finca has suggested last night that we should please ask you to be seated by half past eight so that we can start on the dot of 9 o'clock.  I would just want also to say a very big thank you to the police who are providing security.  These are new things that we are able to thank the police because it was very difficult during the past times.  We thank you very much.  We thank you all at the back and the whole place.  Let us get up.\n The witnesses can leave.  Please wait at the back.  Thank you.   ... end of Tape 6, side A ...",
