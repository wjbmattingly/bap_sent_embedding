            "We welcome the victims and next of kin of those who lost their lives in the incident that we are looking at.  Today is the second and the last day of the resumed hearing on the Bisho massacre that happened on the 7th of September 1992.  I would also say a warm word of welcome to the dignitaries and other leadership figures who are with us this morning.  It's important in order to assist this process and to help with the reckoning of the past that this process is engaged with to have our leaders supporting, physically and otherwise the process.  Thank you for coming.\n I just need to make one or two preliminary remarks before we start listening to the testimonies.  Again just to place on record that this panel hearing the evidence will not be making any findings today.  We won't be making a final decision on any of the many issues which have arisen in this particular matter relating to this particular incident.  Findings will be made in due course once all of the investigations are done and all of the relevant material has been collected and that will be done by the Commission itself.  That's the first point.\n Secondly, I need hardly make this point, but for the record I do, and that is to remind people that although we are not in a court of law we do require a measure of \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2\ndiscipline at the proceedings and that the decorum be maintained throughout the proceedings although sometimes \nthere are issues which arise that we don't always agree with, or we find hard to hear, but it is the very nature of this process that we are called upon to listen to all the perspectives and all the sides, popular or unpopular or otherwise in order to come to an objective decision.\n Finally in this regard just to place on record that it is an offence, like it is in a court of law to wilfully mislead the Commission.  A person who does that is liable to prosecution.\n Just briefly again to introduce the panel which hasn't really changed much since yesterday.  On the far right, on my far right is Advocate Ntsiki Sandi, who is a member of our Human Rights Violations Committee. He is from this region.  He is based at our office in East London.  Next to him is Ms Tiny Maya, member at the same committee also based in East London and in this region, Eastern Cape region.  Next to me is June Crichton who is also a member of the same Human Rights Violations Committee, she works in the region but she is based in Port Elizabeth.  Next to me on my left is the coordinator of our region in the Eastern Cape and of our office in East London, the Reverend Bongani Finca who is a Commissioner.  Next to him, from the Western Cape, based at our Cape Town office, is Dr Mapule Ramashala.  She is a Commissioner and a member of our Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee.  Next to her from Gauteng, based in our Johannesburg office is Ms Hlengiwe Mkhize.  She is the Chairperson of the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee.  Next to her is Reverend Mcebisi Xundu who is a member of the same committee, Reparation and Rehabilitation, EAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3\nand he is based in our offices in Port Elizabeth.\n I am going to ask Ms Maya to read the list of witnesses that will be heard today.\nMS MAYA READS THE NAMES OF THE WITNESSES APPEARING",

After the tea adjournment we would be getting a submission from Brigadier O J Gqozo who was the Chairman of the Ciskei Council of State at the time in September of 1992 when the massacre happened.  That should take us up to the luncheon adjournment and after that we will receive submissions from Dr Antonie Gildenhuys who was at the time Chairman of the Peace Accord Secretariat, as well as testimony from Colonel Chris Nel who was then the head of the Ciskei Military Intelligence.  So we will receive those submissions in addition to the testimony of the persons who have been named in the list read by Ms Maya.

When I arrived home one of my sisters who was working at Bisho came and told me that she was not going to work that day, she was going to Bisho Hospital because some of the survivors were at Bisho Hospital and some of them were at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital.\n At about eight I received a telephone call saying that my son is at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital.
