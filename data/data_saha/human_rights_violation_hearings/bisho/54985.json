            "On the 7th of September my husband got up in the morning and went to the march in Bisho.  We stayed together with our little child.  Our child was seven at the time.  I looked up to my husband, even the child looked up to the father.  My husband then went to Bisho.  At about one o'clock I listened to the news.  I realised from the report that there were shootings in Bisho.  I saw the people that he had gone to Bisho with coming back and he was not amongst the people.  I just assumed that he is still coming.  I slept without seeing him, without hearing any news.\n In the morning of the next day a lady from our area came to me, she asked me if my husband had come back, I said no he did not come back.  I was starting to feel restless because a lot of time had elapsed.  I went together with a lady and a gentleman from my family, we got onto a taxi to Grey Hospital.  Before we got to the Grey Hospital I realised that the people I was with were talking about something.  I was not sure what it was they were talking about.  The taxi then stopped and I was told to get off the \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n1 B SKEPU\ntaxi.  There's a lady they were talking to in the taxi.  I was told to get off the taxi because my husband is in Frere Hospital.  They told me he was injured in the leg.  I then went home.  I had no hope at all.  I got home.  My mother-in-law wondered why I had come back and I told her that I was told to come back home.\n These people came back after a short while.  They said they saw Zanethemba in Frere Hospital, he had been injured in the leg.  I realised that people kept on talking to each other and excluding me.  I then went to one of them and asked exactly what happened, then they still would not tell me.\n I then was told to go to my mother-in-law.  Two men came, if I am not mistaken, but before they came the ladies from our area came to my home.  It was a very hot day.  I was sitting outside.  These women came in and sat in the house.  Then two gentlemen came by.  They told us that my husband had passed away in Bisho.  That was the last time I heard about him.",
