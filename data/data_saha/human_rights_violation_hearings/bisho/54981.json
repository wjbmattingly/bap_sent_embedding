            "Thank you Reverend Finca.  Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen.  A warm word of welcome to you at this the resumed hearing into the event that has become known as the Bisho Massacre.  We have previously listened to a part of the testimony and submissions in regard to this incident in Bisho between the 9th and the 11th of September.  It was not possible at that stage to hear all of the testimony and to take all of the submissions and in view of certain submissions made at that stage it has become necessary to listen to further submissions in response, and for that purpose we will be having the resumed hearing today, the 18th of November and tomorrow the 19th of November, into the massacre.\n Before we start may I bring to your attention just one or two household rules if I may.  Perhaps it's important to explain that at this hearing no findings will be made in regard to any of the issues that are placed before the Commission.  This panel simply receives the testimony and the submissions and findings are made eventually after all the facts are before the Commission and the Commission is satisfied that there has been a thorough canvassing of all the facts and the circumstances as well as a full investigation, or as full an investigation as possible into \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2\nthe particular matter.\n Secondly, just to get it on record, although we are not conducting a court case, and although we are not sitting as a court of law there is a need to maintain decorum, there is a need to maintain a level of discipline at these proceedings and for that purpose I am reminding you of the need in this regard.  Often there are emotional issues that are raised, and often not everybody agrees with what is being said but it is necessary in order to enable the Commission to hear all the sides to a particular incident, that everybody be given a full opportunity to present testimony, to make a submission unhindered, and I'm quite sure I don't need to remind you in this regard.\n Finally insofar as the applicable rules are concerned it is necessary for me also to remind witnesses that in the event of a person wilfully misleading the Commission, or wilfully making false accusations and making false submissions, wilfully, that amounts to an offence and there is provision for appropriate steps to be taken against a person who does that.  Also just by way of a reminder, I am quite sure that there shouldn't be a difficulty in that regard.\n May I also before we start, introduce my colleagues on the panel with me this morning.  I will start on my right, my far right is Advocate Ntsiki Sandi.  He is a member of our Human Rights Violations Committee and he's based at our regional office in East London.\n Next to him is Ms Tiny Maya who is also a member of the Human Rights Violations Committee and she's based in our office here in East London.  \n Next to me on my right-hand side is Ms June Crichton, \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3\nalso a member of the Human Rights Violations Committee.  She is working in this region but she is based at our office in Port Elizabeth.\n On my left is, and I've got to be very careful about this, Ms Pumpla Bogodo-Madikizela who is also a member of the Human Rights Violation Committee and like myself is based in our Cape Town office and works in the Western and Northern Cape region of the Commission.\n Next to her is a well-known face in this part of the world, it's Rev Bongani Finca, who is the convenor of our office in the Eastern Cape in East London, and he is also a member of the Human Rights Violations Committee, he's a Commissioner.\n Next to him is Dr Mapule Ramashala.  She is based in the Western Cape, in our Cape Town office and she is a member of our Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee.  She is a Commissioner.\n Then right at the end, on my extreme left, is Ms Hlengiwe Mkhize.  She is based at our Johannesburg Office, in the Gauteng region, and she is the Chairperson of our Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee.\n I am Denzil Potgieter.  I am based in Cape Town and I am in the Human Rights Violations Committee.  Thank you.\n As you have heard Reverend Finca reporting that we have a bit of a delay, understandably in view of the weather, and for that reason we have re-scheduled the items on the agenda and we will proceed immediately to the submissions on behalf of the National Party which will be presented by Mr Roelf Meyer, Premier Hernus Kriel and Mr Ray Radue.  I invite them to the podium.",

            "MR MEYER",
            "Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson, members of the Commission first of all I would like to say thank you very much for the opportunity that the Commission has also created for us to be able to come to East London this morning and to testify to the Commission and to give evidence regarding the views of the National Party as to what happened on the 7th of September 1992 at Bisho.\n We recognise the fact that Mr Pik Botha was before the Commission previously and no doubt he has given also certain views that related to the position of the National Party, but he has also given evidence in regard to his portfolio that he then held responsibility for, namely the then Minister of Foreign Affairs. \n In the light of the submissions that were earlier on given to the Commission, and in the light of the fact that it appeared to us that there might have been some corrections that we would like to put to the Commission we have therefore asked the Commission, through the Chairperson and the Vice Chairperson to be given the opportunity, and we are very glad that, especially Reverend Finca, has taken care of the arrangements in this regard, and has made it possible for us to be here this morning.  So we would like to express our appreciation to the Commission for the fact that especially at our request the arrangements were made \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n5 R MEYER\nlike it is.\n I am here in my capacity Chairperson as Secretary General of the National Party and therefore I will start off by introducing our submission.  Premier Kriel, of course, at that particular occasion when this incident occurred, was the Minister of Law and Order and will be able to give evidence as to his experience of that particular occasion and he was assisted on that very day by Senator Ray Radue, who was the then member of Parliament for King Williamstown.   We have drafted a submission Chairperson which we have made available to the Commission and also to the Press and in the submission we have stated our position as it will be clear from the document itself.  But in order to save time and as the document itself is quite clear, will be quite clear for everybody to read we have also drafted an Executive Summary which I am now going to put for the purposes of my introductory remarks, and then of course Premier Kriel and Senator Ray Radue will also come in if they would so require and in any event would be available for questions. I am reading from the Executive Summary therefore Chairperson.\n Certain submissions have been placed before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission regarding the tragic shootings which occurred on the 7th of September 1992 at Bisho in what was then the Ciskei.  The National Party wishes to submit further information regarding that unfortunate incident.  This submission is not intended attribute guilt or liability.  That is a matter which has already conclusively been determined by the Goldstone Commission, but to assist the TRC in its endeavours to promote reconciliation by establishing the truth.\nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n6 R MEYER\n Circumstances leading up to the shootings indicate that rolling mass action, which when exercised responsibly within the parameters of agreed mechanisms in itself is a democratic tool to express one's opinion, but was under these circumstances deliberately organised to put pressure on a negotiating process, even whilst negotiations on the Record of Understanding which was signed on the 26th of September 1992, a mere three weeks later, was in its conclusive stage of finalisation.  It was this document that put negotiations back on track and that eventually led to the free and democratic elections of April 1994 and the peaceful reincorporation of the Ciskei.  On the other hand a dictator was determined to fiercely protect his fifedom until the last moment regardless of the consequences.  This submission alludes to the dismal failure of the so-called Leipzig Option advocated by the SACP with the ANC in tow and the grave mistakes made by the SACP leaders in under-estimating the Gqozo regime's resolve not to abdicate its power because of the mere presence of the ANC/SACP alliance and its rhetoric.\n The submission highlights the political agreement which had been reached by all parties at CODESA 1 and in its work groups.  It focuses on the multi-party agreement which was supported by the then government, the ANC/SACP alliance and the Gqozo regime had all been party to those agreements which provided for a peaceful and constitutional reincorporation of the so-called TBVC states into the New South Africa.  \n It underlines the government's continued commitment to deal with this sensitive matter on an inclusive and agreed basis replacing unilateral action with consultation with all EAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n7 R MEYER\nconcerned parties.  The  submission emphasises the then \ngovernment's honouring of its commitments to all inclusive negotiations at all times.  It serves to stress the progress which had been recorded at working group 4, under the auspices of CODESA 1 and to question the ensuing occurrences against the background of unanimity between all relevant players in this strategy.\n It notes that agreement had been reached inter alia between the government, the ANC/SACP alliance and the Ciskeans on reincorporation of the independent states, the restoration of citizenship, the testing of the will of the Ciskean people in respect of reincorporation, the necessity of retaining business confidence during reincorporation and most importantly that the reincorporation process would have to be formally legislated through the relevant legislative bodies.\n The agreement reached in Working Group 4, pertaining to reincorporation were eventually all implemented in the interim constitution.  Bloodshed had not been necessary to achieve this goal.  The notion of reincorporation of the TBVC continued to be accepted by all parties, even after the collapse of Codesa II which had not been precipitated by the issues dealt with by Working Group 4.  At no time after the collapse of the negotiating process did the ANC/SACP alliance distance itself from those agreements, nor did it at any time thereafter deny or break off its recognition of the Ciskei or its rulers as important players in the negotiating process.  \n This underlines two important issues.  Firstly, that the government of the day had fully cooperated in including all TBVC states and their constitutional future in the EAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n8 R MEYER\nmulti-party negotiating process.  At no time and nowhere did the then government try to prevent the constitutional reincorporation of all TBVC states and at no stage did it try to preserve any of the TBVC states' independence indefinitely.\n Secondly, that the ANC/SACP alliance had accepted and actively supported the TBVC states' status right to participate in a negotiating process.  It vociferously advocated and supported the inclusion of those states in the process and actively cooperated with all of them at the negotiating table.  \n The government had adopted an even-handed and fair attitude towards all of the TBVC states.  It sought to accommodate all interest groups in the process and often mediated and facilitated talks between differing parties.  It sought to create circumstances within which the constitutional future of the TBVC states could be determined by agreement with all parties and interested groups concerned.  \n In trying to achieve this it was often caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.  The ANC/SACP effectively, but irresponsibly exploited the government's dilemma of having to fulfil its duties in respect of impartial and good governance whilst having to take part in the negotiating process at the same time.  It reflects on the ambivalence and opportunistic attitude of the ANC/SACP alliance in accepting the Ciskei's presence and participation at the negotiating table, yet trying to hold the government responsible for all the Ciskei's actions, of, at times rejecting independence of the Ciskei, yet forcefully defending the independence of its allies, the Transkei and EAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n9 R MEYER\nVenda.  And by blaming the government for not unilaterally \nand extra-constitutionally removing Gqozo and revoking the Ciskei's independence whilst insisting on an all-inclusive negotiating process.\n The submission traces all the positive steps taken by the government of the day to avert bloodshed or a crisis.  It provides a reminder of the successful mediation undertaken by the government on a previous occasion when a march to Bisho had been peaceful. It indicates the number of steps taken on all fronts by the government to ensure the peaceful and free exercise of political rights in the Ciskei.  \n The submission includes, Chairperson, details of the weak and deteriorating relationship between the government and the stubborn Gqozo regime, and how the government sought to use its good offices as a positive influence on the increasing tensions developing between the Gqozo and ANC/SACP alliance.  \n The submission traces the contributory causes of the shooting starting with the attempted coup d'etat by Onwod Gozana and Charles Sebe in late 1990, resulting in a clash between Oupa Gqozo and Chris Hani, leading to the mass action and the Nehawu strike action against the Gqozo regime in March and April of 1991.  The first attempted and failed march of 25 November 1991 to Bisho.  The second campaign of mass action designed to facilitate the occupation of Bisho which was foiled when exposed by the media.  The peaceful march to Bisho on 4 August 1992 after the then government had successfully mediated between the Gqozo regime and the ANC/SACP alliance.  Finally the tragic and unnecessary violent confrontation on 7 September 1992.\nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n10 R MEYER\n The submission notes the Goldstone Commission's \nfindings on the strategy namely, that had the Ciskei authorities acceded to the pleas of the South African Government the SAP and the NPS to allow a peaceful and negotiated mass demonstration to take place, the violence could have been averted.  That the Ciskean defence forces' failure to close the gap in the fence of the Bisho stadium amounted to gross negligence and unprofessional.  Its condemnation of violence or strong-arm tactics to physically occupy a town or public facility as the ANC had been planning to do, especially when the vast majority of South Africans believed that no effort shall be spared to move to a democratic government by peaceful means. Its finding that the threats made by some leaders of the ANC/SACP alliance to embark on mass action with the intention of intimidation and directly causing the change of existing power is against the letter and spirit of the National Peace Accord.  And its recommendation that the leadership of the alliance should publicly censure Mr Kasrils and other persons who were responsible for the decision to lead demonstrators through the gap in the fence and thereby knowingly and negligently exposing them to the danger of death and injury.Chairperson I would like to read, lastly, the concluding paragraph on page 20 of the main submission, paragraph 5 on page 20.\n The epitaph to this sad and avoidably regrettable tragedy will be written by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.The tragedy had been totally unnecessary because it had been avoidable.  All relevant parties had been involved in open negotiations on the constitutional future of South Africa and of the Ciskei.  All relevant parties had committed themselves to a peaceful resolution of conflict \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n11 R MEYER\nand a peaceful transition and the government and the ANC were in the conclusive stage of preparing the Record of Understanding.  Those who were killed and injured at Bisho were at the wrong place at the wrong time being led by irresponsible and reckless leaders against the tyrant and the regime with weapons wrongfully shooting at them, and although all measures had been taken to try and safeguard a peaceful outcome to the crisis they paid the ultimate price for reasons we may still not fully comprehend.  They should not be forgotten.\n The National Party therefore requests that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in its final report on the tragic shootings at Bisho on 7 September 1992 include a list of the names of all children, women and men who died on that fateful day under the burning African sun.  Let the names and tragedy of that day remind us all, and our children, of the price they paid for us to enter into the New South Africa.\n I thank you.",

            "Thank you very much Chairperson, Honourable Members of the Commission.  I think my contribution will be more on the efforts made by the then South African government to try and prevent any bloodshed on that day.\n Let me first of all say this to you Sir, that it became quite clear from the media, as well as information that came to the South African Police at the time that the march on that fateful day was going to cause problems and trouble and may lead to bloodshed.  That is why I believe the South African Police, and they have to talk for themselves, but \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n12 H KRIEL\nthat they deployed more people on that day than would normally have been here in Bisho, or on the King Williamstown side.\n We regarded this matter of such importance that on that morning the following politicians from the old regime found themselves at the South African Embassy at the time ...(tape ends)... \n ...room were set up to deal with information and if necessary to be used as a place for negotiations.  The late Mr Gert Myburgh who was then my deputy minister of Law and Order, he arrived here.  So did Mr Wynand Breytenbach, the deputy minister of Defence. So did the then member of Parliament who is now Senator Radue, he also arrived there, as well as myself who was then the Minister of Law and Order.\n Now Sir you will recall, and I think that evidence must have been led, that there was an application from the ANC/SACP to hold this march.  It was agreed to by the South African side magistrate.  It was eventually also agreed to by the magistrate of the Ciskei.  But in spite of this it did not meet with the approval of Brigadier Gqozo at the time.  \n However, on that morning, and I was during that morning constantly also in contact, and so was Senator Radue, and especially, and I want to mention one other name and that is the Ambassador at the time who was Mr Piet Goosen, we were in constant contact, trying to make contact with Brigadier Gqozo, with the Peace Monitors, and two of them were present that day if I remember correctly, it was Mr Antonie Geldenhuys and Dion Rudman, and we were trying to sort-of set up a shuttle diplomacy that day to try and prevent \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n13 H KRIEL\nproblems arising.  \n Eventually and to our great relief at that stage Brigadier Gqozo told us, or Mr Goosen if I remember correctly, that he will not act against anybody taking part in that march.  You can imagine, Chairperson, our relief, but just to make sure we decided we wanted to have a look at the march but at the same time also personally make contact with Brigadier Gqozo.  \n We therefore got into a helicopter, the people I just mentioned, flew over these thousands of people preparing for the march.  We then flew to where Brigadier Gqozo had his office.  We landed. We were escorted into his office where some of his then people from his military council assisted him.  We met, I congratulated him on his wise decision that he will not prevent the march from taking place.  He was very nervous at the time, I must say this to you, that he was worried that the march could be just a sort-of a facade to get rid of him and his government.  In any case we had a discussion about this.  I said to him at the time that if everybody sticks to the rules of the game then nothing will go wrong on that particular day.  I then took my leave and left, again with the helicopter and landed back at the South African Embassy at the time.  I told the other, or we came to the conclusion, both Senator Radue at the time, myself and the late Gert Myburgh that we have a chance to avert any bloodshed that particular day.\n Whilst we were sitting in the Embassy waiting to find out what will happen eventually when the march will take place we were kept informed that the march started and that everything was going according to plan, that everybody stuck to the route, and then all of a sudden Sir,  the very \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n14 H KRIEL\ndisturbing news, the very upsetting news that shooting had started came to us.  One sort of got the feeling that with everything you have tried you didn't achieve what you set out to do.\n Unfortunately that is what happened, shooting did take place.  Shortly afterwards when everything calmed down after this horrible thing has happened, Mr Antonie Geldenhuys and Mr Rudman returned to the Embassy.  They gave us a full account of exactly what happened. I didn't see what happened at the march as such because I was in the Embassy.   They gave us a full account of what happened.  Later that afternoon we were also presented with two videos by the South African Police Services that they took.  We had a look at that, and I can only recommend to this Commission that if they can get hold of that, and that should be available, that that will be a very informative piece of evidence for this Commission really to see what happened on that particular day.\n So you will Chairperson, Honourable Commissioners that we did try to prevent people from being hurt that day and from being killed.  We did not succeed.  I will not sit in judgement as to who must take the blame, but it certainly wasn't through lack of trying of the then South African Government, and what we tried to do that day and before that, through the Police Services, through politicians, through diplomatic representation to avoid this, certainly we have tried to prevent that.\n Thank you very much.",

            "Thank you Chairperson, Members of the Commission.  It's a privilege to be here.  I am actually in\nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n15 SENATOR RADUE\nmy own area and very familiar coming from King Williamstown, having served that community for many, many years as a member of Parliament and subsequently the Eastern Cape as a Senator.\n May I just say that I would like to give perhaps a slightly local perspective of the whole situation.  When the mass march was announced there was a great deal of trepidation in King Williamstown, both among businessmen and among the local residents.  They were aware of the fact that there had been a call for rolling mass action.  And they knew from previous experience that this disrupted their lives immensely.  There was also a fear that there could be repercussions if the march was finally frustrated at the boundary and that frustrated people should return again via King Williamstown.  It was therefore in the interests of the people of King Williamstown and in the interests of the Republic as it then was of South Africa, to ensure that the march as far as humanly possible would be made to be peaceful.\n I had, and there is reference to the question of Codesa, I had had the privilege of being one of the National Party representatives at Working Group 4 which dealt with the reincorporation of the TBVC states and I can confirm personally that there had been complete consensus and agreement between the then South African government, the ANC/SACP alliance and also the Ciskean regime who were represented at those talks, that the process and procedure for a peaceful transformation of Ciskei and reincorporation would take place, and that was never, ever queried.\n Let us move on to the actual events of the day as my two colleagues have indicated.  The magistrate at Zwelitsha \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n16 SENATOR RADUE\nhad specifically agreed to the mass march within the borders of the then Ciskei.  There were three conditions.  The first was that it was to be peaceful.  The second was that it had to follow the route designated by the Ciskean government and thirdly that the rally had to terminate at 4:30 in the afternoon, 16H30, to allow the people to return home peacefully.\n Now Mr Kriel has clearly indicated the background as to what took place.  I wish to confirm that I was also part of the delegation that went to Brigadier Gqozo's office at the time.  I was present when Premier Kriel thanked Brigadier Gqozo for cooperating finally, after a great deal of pressure I may add.  Premier Kriel also reminded him at the time that it had been then President F W de Klerk who had broken the ice by allowing mass marches, particularly the one in Adderley Street in Cape Town, and that we believed that this was a democratic right which was owned by the people and that in fact what Gqozo had finally decided was the right thing.  \n He expressed his concerns at the time that the leaders of the march had indicated that they would not abide by the decision of the magistrate, but that they would try to Bisho.  He was very concerned.  He indicated that he had given orders to protect Bisho.\n Now we move on to the situation where, and this appeared later in the video which I trust that members of the Commission will look at, which I also was privileged to see, that the National Peace Committee at the boundary repeatedly warned and advised the marchers to be very careful to adhere to the Zwelitsha magistrate's decisions and conditions of the march to stay within the designated \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n17 SENATOR RADUE\narea, to proceed to the Bisho stadium peacefully and to disperse peacefully.\n Unfortunately that did not take place. After we had returned to the Embassy I wished to confirm with the National Party Federal Information Service for purposes of a possible media release precisely what had happened in King Williamstown up to that stage, and I sent personally, through the Embassy's fax, a fax to the NP Federal Information Service at 13H49, that was immediately prior to the tragic events, a fax which I would like to share with the Commission and which I will hand in the original, if I may read it Chairperson.\n\"The National Party views the whole position in the Border Ciskei region in a serious light.  We welcome the presence of a strong contingent of the South African Police, backed up by the South African Defence Force as a necessary precaution against possible bloodshed and as a reassuring factor for the South African citizens residing and carrying on business in King Williamstown.  The position is now clear.  The march has been sanctioned by both the magistrate in Zwelitsha, Ciskei, and the magistrate in King Williamstown.  The important conditions are that it must be peaceful and abide by the agreed route, and also that it will terminate in the independent stadium in Bisho at 16H30.  No march will be permissible in Bisho itself.  The South African Government and the Ciskei Military Council have accepted these terms and the march is proceeding at this time.  It appears that there are approximately 18,000\nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n18 SENATOR RADUE\npeople taking part.  The ANC and its alliance partners have been fully informed of the conditions.  Any breach of these on their part could lead to serious confrontation with the Ciskean Security Forces.  The National Party therefore expresses the hope that all parties will abide by the conditions laid down by both magistrates, and that the march will proceed lawfully and peacefully.   The NP welcomes the thorough protective measures taken by the SA Police to ensure the safety of the people of King.  It accepts unequivocally that everything possible has been done in this regard.  The National Party rejects criticism that the declaration of the magisterial areas of King Williamstown and East London was an over-reaction....\"\nthat is a reference to the declarations of emergency for the purposes of the march.\n\"It is the NP's view that the position is so serious, and the danger of conflict so real that the additional powers placed at the disposal of the police were in the circumstances absolutely essential.  It is also clear that this is a temporary measure to cover this mass action protest march only.  I personally welcome the presence of Minister of Law and Order Hernus Kriel, and his deputy minister Gert Myburgh as also Mr Wynand Breytenbach, deputy minister of Defence, as well as the senior officers of the South African Police and defence force in King Williamstown.  I express my sincere appreciation\nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n19 SENATOR RADUE\non behalf of the citizens of King Williamstown for the deep concern which their presence reflects\".\nThat was a fax I sent through, and the proof of the fax is attached to the documentation, if I may hand it in for the information.  Thank you.\n To finalise my few remarks, one might ask and as the National Party has already indicated clearly we take no sides in this matter.  It's for the Commission to decide as to exactly what happened.  But if one was personally asked, and I refer only to my own personal view now, what was the cause of the shooting, I would say that the actions of Mr Ronnie Kasrils amounted to a flagrant and reckless violation of the conditions laid down by the Zwelitsha magistrate.  Mr Kasrils was aware of the high emotions generated by the mass march.  He was aware of the strict conditions imposed on the Ciskean side, especially that a demarcated route into the stadium should be followed, yet he chose wilfully to disregard the warnings of the National Peace Committee and the magistrate's conditions, and he initiated the breakaway.  I believe, myself personally, that it is his action that led and was the effective cause of the whole tragedy.\n I honestly believe that if the marchers had stayed within the precincts of the route and gone into the stadium, held a demonstration in the light of the Codesa agreement, that no firing would have taken place and the tragedy would not have occurred.\n I thank you Mr Chairman.",

I indicated that Mr Pik Botha spoke from what I read, according to his submission, he spoke mainly regarding or on behalf of the position that he held at that stage as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and obviously he was  called upon by the Commission to come and speak in that capacity, namely his own dealings with the situation in that capacity since the Ciskei was then regarded as an independent state, and of course he had to take responsibility of, by the South African Government, in that capacity.  So what he actually presented to you on the previous occasion was his own experiences and memories in that capacity.  What became clear to us after having heard of the submission that he made to the Commission was that there were also other aspects of what the government at that stage did, as Mr Kriel has particularly referred to, in trying to prevent the tragedy of the 7th of September.  And we thought that it would be appropriate therefore for the National Party to ensure that that particular experience, that Mr Kriel and Mr Radue could share with the Commission should also be submitted to you, and that we would like to reflect from an overall perspective, therefore, how the National Party see the events that led up to the shooting and what actually went wrong at that occasion.

So whatever the description is that one would use in terms of how we experienced the gentleman, I think we all came to the same conclusion, and that is we were dealing with a person that could act irresponsibly with power.

Because what we attempted to do, from the side of the South African Government, was actually to get a\nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n22 R MEYER\nconstitutional resolve to the whole conflict as quickly as \npossible.  I might point out that throughout the period after the normalisation of the political process has started in 1990, it was our endeavour all the time to, as quickly as possible, find a way forward as far as an all party or a multi party negotiated settlement is concerned.  Therefore throughout 1990 and 1991 we tried to urge all the parties to come to the table for negotiations as quickly as possible.  In that process I would say that the first and real objective of the then South African Government was actually to find, as quickly as possible, a negotiated settlement, get all the parties there and that eventually of course happened when we got all the parties together at Codesa 1, and that was the main aim that I believe the South African Government amongst ourselves shared, but it was certainly also the main aim that was shared by all the parties as I indicated in the submission, inter alia also by the ANC and its alliance partners.",

            "Thank you Chairperson.  Roelf Meyer, I would like to refer my comments to you.  You, in your submission, you make reference to the fact that all parties were involved in the negotiations and you frame your debate in a particular way which reflects a specific perspective suggesting that putting the blame of responsibility on the shoulders of the ANC and suggesting that the ANC should have trusted Gqozo's commitment to the process of negotiation.  I think that perspective ignores an important context which is that within the Ciskei itself there was a lot of heavy anti ANC culture which was reinforced, seems to have been EAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n23 R MEYER\nreinforced by the visible presence of the South African \nDefence Force secondments within the management of the Ciskean Government.  So I think that is a very important context to remember even though all these parties were involved in negotiations and the ANC should have, theoretically, trusted the commitments by that process and by Gqozo especially.  But what was happening on the ground, there were state of emergencies, there was a very anti-ANC culture, so those factors should also be considered, I think.\n The second comment I'd like to make is around your submission that the South African Government, the then South African Government made every effort to ensure a peaceful and free exercise of political rights in the Ciskei.  I am wondering whether the ideas, your ideas to achieve that peaceful and free expression of political rights was then reinforced or not by bringing on board of people like Major General Victor who used to be the head of the ANC/PAC desk in the headquarters, security branch headquarters, who was also in charge of Vlakplaas activity according to the dossier that we have of him, and in fact Dirk Coetzee who is supposed to have reportedly told by the dossier that Dirk Coetzee reported to Victor, now Victor was the Commissioner of Police at the time in Ciskei and he was seconded by the South African Government, I am wondering if those strategies, you know bringing somebody with that kind of background to the Ciskei whether that in fact assists your ideas, would have assisted your ideas of ensuring peaceful and free expression of political will within the Ciskei?  I am just wondering what the relationship between bringing a person with that kind of background, with the Vlakplaas \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n24 R MEYER\nbackground like Victor to that situation in Ciskei, whether \nit helped in fact bring about peaceful change or whether in fact it achieved the opposite.  And what the South African Government's role in bringing that kind of mentality within the governance of Ciskei was.  Those are the comments that I would like to make.  \n The final comment is about your submission and how in fact it seems that the South African Government at the time remains blameless, totally blameless, and it's either the Ciskei Defence Force or the Ciskei Police or the ANC.  One of the documents that we have makes reference to the involvement of the South African Embassy in the planning of the deployment of forces around the march.  And generally the involvement of the South African Embassy in appointing former South African Defence personnel to the Ciskei to manage departments like Finance, the Army, the Police.  And I am really wondering what exactly was the role of the South African Government in maintaining a certain kind of mindsets within the Ciskean government and in fact in encouraging the anti-ANC thinking, or even in encouraging a certain kind of management of policing within the Ciskei.",

            "Thank you Chairperson, thank you Commissioner for the comments.  Maybe Mr Kriel would like to respond to your second comment in regard to the specific gentleman that you have referred to.  Can I say....(tape ends) ... the right to organise the march.  I think there's sufficient proof of the fact, through our submission now, but also through what Mr Pik Botha has early on testified before the Commission, namely that both on the 4th of August and again on the 7th of September the then South African Government, definitely, was not against the taking place of such a march EAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n25 R MEYER\nand the demonstration, and that it was a sort-of ongoing type of event at that stage.  I can recall that between June and September of 1992 many such demonstrations actually took place right through the country because it was quite clear that the ANC wanted to make a point very clear to the nation as a whole at that stage, through demonstrations, and in support of their demands to get negotiations going again.  And what we are actually saying is that by the time of this tragedy on the 7th of September we were in fact very close to come to agreement on the Record of Understanding and that it was practically not necessary for the ANC actually to proceed with the demonstration at that stage because the point, so to speak, was already made and that we were on the conclusion, almost, of the Record of Understanding.  \n So, yes, the ANC had the right, no doubt about that, to organise the march and one might even say that the reason why they selected Bisho as the venue for that demonstration, one can also, from the perspective, if one has to be objective, understand.  But on the other hand, as Mr Radue has clearly indicated the way in which it was conducted that led to the shooting was quite clearly going too far and that was the problem that we believe the Goldstone Commission has already concluded on.  \n That is why we are saying in our submission it is not for us now, in any event a person like myself was not present, and one can only judge from the facts that were presented to, for instance, the Goldstone Commission.  And we believe, on the facts that were presented to the Commission, right then, during the month of September 1992, because the Goldstone Commission report was actually delivered before the end of that month, so the facts were \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n26 R MEYER\nvery clear in everybody's mind at that stage, and on the basis of those facts the Goldstone Commission came to certain conclusions and we are saying maybe that would be the best to stick to those findings and take that as the acceptable factual basis to come to any conclusions.\n On the last comment the question of responsibility, it would be difficult for me to actually respond to that, maybe Mr Pik Botha might have been in a better position to respond on behalf of his department, the then Department of Foreign Affairs.  But I think what became clear from the evidence presented to the Goldstone Commission as well as the information available to us, that the then mission of the South African Government under Ambassador Goosen, actually tried to do its level best to find a way forward as far as peaceful handling of the situation was concerned.  I have no evidence available to me that indicates that there was actually any form of cooperation to assist and support the Ciskean Government in what they have done finally on that particular day in planning for that and whatever, but of course I have to speak in terms of information available to me and therefore it would be difficult to respond specifically to any other alleged information.",

I would like to raise then the question that I had originally prepared before I looked at the statement, and I would think that perhaps I will raise the question and direct it to the three members representing the National Party.  There is a view, and I think it's a very strong view widely held by a number of people in this country and even abroad, that the South African government had the power and had the means to prevent the bloodbath, what they lacked was the will to do so.  We have put this question to Mr Pik Botha when he was here and the answer we received was not satisfactory.

They had the power, they had the means, they intervened in Ciskean affairs right to the point of appointing Cabinet ministers when they wanted to do so, but in this particular case, and the submission is made to us EAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n32 R MEYER\nthat because lives which were in danger of being lost were Black lives, and Black lives are cheap, the RSA government did not have the will to act in this particular instance.

            "Chairperson thank you very much.  I think this is an important issue that is being raised by Reverend Finca.  I would first of all like to state categorically that a perception or a submission that might have been made to the Commission in that regard, namely that the previous South African government failed in its duty because Black lives were not dear to them, I reject totally that suggestion, that submission or that perception.  That is absolutely incorrect.  I think proof is there as it was submitted here this morning by Premier Kriel and Mr Radue that they were actually sent, a delegation of the South African Government was specifically sent to Bisho on that very day by the then State President Mr de Klerk to ensure that the demonstration can be carried out peacefully.  It was for that reason that Premier Kriel went to see Mr Gqozo and ensured that he allows the demonstration to take place in a peaceful way.  And with all due respect as it is being proved by Mr Radue's fax which was sent just before one o'clock that day, it was actually accepted by all present at that point in time that the demonstration would be carried out peacefully, and that there was actually no reason, at that very moment, to further intervene or interfere.\n The question overall of how we handled the situation as far as the TBVC states are concerned I think is also a relevant one Commissioner.  The point in that regard I would say  is  by  September  of  '92  we had a total break-up of\nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n33 R MEYER\nnegotiations and by the 7th of September of '92, if one just looks back a little bit at the perspective of how matters developed, one must recall that by the 16th of May of that year Codesa II collapsed, so multi-party negotiations came to an end.  In spite of that, however, the work of Working Group 4, which is also indicated in the submission, was confirmed by the parties.  In fact I think one can say that Working Group 4's report was the only one that was actually approved by Codesa II before it collapsed on the work of the other working groups.  In other words although the parties could not reach agreement on the work of the other working groups, including the question of progress with the interim constitution, at least there was agreement between all the parties on the work of Working Group 4, and that included the South African Government, the ANC and all relevant parties.  \n What I am saying by that is that there was confirmation by all parties, including the South African Government, that the TBVC states must be reincorporated into South Africa and it was a question through which means it should take place, and the obvious answer to that was to get agreement on an interim constitution, to ensure the reincorporation.  Now after May of '92 for almost a year there were no multi-party negotiations, in other words progress towards the interim constitution could not take place, but between June and September of '92 the relevant parties, including specifically the South African Government and the ANC, were on a bilateral basis involved in ironing out the stumbling blocks impeding the negotiations as it was then perceived.  And that was the main, or the crux of the whole objective at that stage, to get negotiations back on track so that we can EAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n34 R MEYER\nmake progress towards an interim constitution.  \n It was therefore, with due respect Chairperson, to my mind not the appropriate moment then to find other ways to deal with the TBVC states, but to get negotiations back on track with a view to come to an agreement, as quickly as possible, also on the question of reincorporation of the TBVC states.  And that applied to all four of them, Transkei, Venda, Bophuthatswana and Ciskei and that was the view held by the South African Government.  And with all due respect, although Ciskei might have been a pain in the neck, both to the South African Government and to the ANC there was not a reason for any deviation from that agreed policy position, that was the agreement between the South African Government, the ANC and all other relevant parties at that point of time.",

I fully accept that.  And in the same spirit I would say yes the mistake is obvious, the mistake that we have created an independent state like the Ciskei is the most obvious of those mistakes.  And I would not deny responsibility for that as far as the previous South African Government is concerned.  Whatever happened that particular day, and where the blame was for that particular day is almost different to that question.  The real question therefore is how could this have been avoided, and it could have been avoided by not having had the Ciskei as an independent state at all.",

I want to bluntly refer to the golden handshakes that have been publicly pointed out.  I would like to publicly refer to the rewards that were given to the people who successfully committed missions to kill and to kill and to kill.  We have been very successful in killing.

Have there been any discussions at all within the National Party about these children, about these women who were left without?

I don't think it's possible now, I would not do right to the issue you have raised if I try to respond now to that question.  I can say, yes, we are in various ways within the National Party attending to this question and related questions.  What I would like to suggest is that we have a responsibility to come back to the Commission on this very question.  We have already indicated to the Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson of the Commission that we are preparing a further written submission to the Commission and I would like to suggest that this very issue should form part of that further submission to the Commission.

Mr Meyer you will appreciate the fact that we haven't had time to look at your document, I will just ask a few, not really questions, but points of clarification.  On page 1 of the Executive's Summary, there is a paragraph starting with \"Circumstances leading up....\", the last sentence there it says,\n\"This submission alludes to the dismal failure of the so-called Leipzig Option advocated by the SACP with the ANC in tow, and the grave mistakes made by SACP leaders in underestimating the Gqozo regimes' resolve not to abdicate its power because of the mere presence of the ANC/SACP alliance and its rhetoric\".\nI would really like you to briefly explain what is meant by that.\n Then page 2 to 3 there is a statement where I would say you argue that the government leaders of the TBVC did not try to preserve any of those states' independence \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n40 R MEYER\nindefinitely.  That argument it seems to be a contradiction given the fact that people who then led a march, that march led to brutal shootings of defenceless marchers, it's a contradiction which I would like you to talk to, because given your statement I would imagine that nobody will decide to shoot anyone in view of the fact that it was no longer an issue.  So it's a point also which I would like you to sort-of clarify us or elaborate upon.\n Then page 5 where you say, the last line, you say,\n\"The NP wishes to achieve reconciliation between all who were affected by this incident by establishing the truth so that all can make peace with their adversaries and themselves and so that all can tackle the challenges which face all of us\".\nI would just like to put it to you that I can tell you straight away that having had the advantage of talking to survivors in different communities we are not likely to achieve peace if we have no way of declaring in full the thinking which went on at the time and how people sees it especially now when they look back.  As some of the fellow Commissioners have indicated people might be gracious when they appear before us but often when we do community education they raise penetrating questions regarding what happened and why was it done.  \n The last question which I have, I would just like to know whether there were specific instructions given possibly by the Minister of Law and Order at the time to all people who were armed, particularly people who represented the State and the government so as to handle the situation differently as against what had happened in June 16, we have EAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n41 R MEYER\nheard about the six day wars, the seven day wars, this incident happened at the time when peace negotiations were well in advance, one will assume that the State and government officials were given specific instructions to handle the situation differently?

            "Chairperson, Commissioner, as far as the first point of clarification is concerned on page 1 of the Executive Summary, in that particular sentence we are referring first of all to what is being referred to in the main document also as the so-called Leipzig Option.  I think that is terminology that comes from certain newspaper quotes that is being referred to in the main document where I think it was Mr Raymond Suttner was quoted by referring to that Option.  There are extensive quotes in the main document referring to Mr Suttner and others who have apparently been responsible to design the strategy and afterwards they were called upon to give their reactions and so forth by the media, so that is what is being referred to there.   I would say that I think the clarity will come if one reads the main document in that regard.\n The other part of that sentence indicates that maybe on the side of those that led the demonstration there was an under-estimation of what actually Gqozo had in mind, and that there was something of, if one also reads the comments afterwards, again in the main document, it appears that there was almost a challenge that was executed by those that led the demonstration to see almost how far Gqozo might go in his reaction.  And I think that is what is being indicated to in this sentence.  But that links up with the next page and your second question actually.\nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n42 R MEYER\n In that regard Chairperson I think it's important to note that, and I think one has to make the observation that although the parties, be it at Codesa or at a later stage, all agreed to the reincorporation of the TBVC states they resisted it in various ways, up to a very late stage.  I must remind Honourable Commissioners of for instance the case of Bophuthatswana they were not even after the conclusion of the interim constitution, or the negotiations on the interim constitution, they were at that stage even still not prepared to give up and to become part of the New South Africa.  I don't have to refer now, because it's not relevant as far as this meeting is concerned and I believe the Commission will separately deal with that issue, but various other decisions and actions had to follow before the actual reincorporation of Bophuthatswana could be effected, although they were also part of the original agreement in Working Group 4.  So what I am trying to prove with this point is to say the parties were all part of the original agreement in Working Group 4, but it didn't mean it's true.\n Now with hindsight one can reflect on that and say it is clear that they did not right through up to the end, or at every given moment, agree to actually work for the execution of those agreements.  And that again is reflected also, to my mind, in what happened on the 7th of September. Because in a certain way that was an indication of Gqozo's reaction against the agreement to which he was himself part of.  \n I hope I have tried to clarify that particular point that we are actually getting to in the submission, namely to say there were agreements, all parties were part of it, including the Ciskean Government, but they were not \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n43 R MEYER\nnecessarily executing it in the way that one should have thought they should have.\n Maybe the last question Mr Kriel would like to respond to.",

I think the question you have put to me is a fair one and that is, if I understood you correctly, and that is whether there were any changes in methods to deal with situations.  I can say to you that certainly at the time when the ANC were unbanned and other parties - when the negotiating process started and when I came to the Police the whole attitude of the Police was to use minimum force to handle situations.  But it must also be remembered that at that very crucial time in the history of our country it was essential that we have a climate in which negotiations could take place.  So we also had a duty to try and maintain order in our country.\n Coming back closer to what happened at Bisho, I can say to you if you think that on that day we should have taken away all the weapons, there was no way that bar creating a war that we could take the weapons away from the Brigadier's army.  I also want to say to you that there was no way in which the Police could search 18,000 people, I think that's the number they say that were there that day, to find and confiscate weapons.  There are certain situations that it's just not possible to do that and that was one of them. You couldn't, with the number of policemen available and policewomen do that, it's just not possible.\n We must also say to each other that at that stage it was not only the defence force in possession of firearms, but many of the people, not part of the old regime, were also in possession of firearms.

I just don't have it available right now.\n On the second question Chairperson I am afraid that I don't have a specific framework within which to respond to the question.  The Commissioner apparently is referring to \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n47 R MEYER\ngeneral, or allegations of general gross human rights violations that took place in the Ciskei, if I understood him correctly.  If there would be specific points in that regard I guess it might be easier to respond and indicate what actions or steps we might have taken.  But I must again point out that the situation as far as the TBVC states are concerned, in general, at that stage, even in 1992 were such that they were regarded as independent states, wrongly maybe one would argue, but the fact of the matter is that we, from the South African side, didn't have the authority over the Transkei, Venda, Bophuthatswana or Ciskei for that matter to act like the Commission might have suggested.  These governments, again rightly or wrongly, were in full control of their own justice departments, they appointed their own civil servants in those different capacities, they had their own defence forces, their own police forces and so forth.  The question is therefore difficult to respond to unless there are specific references that the Commissioner would like to point out then maybe one can follow up on that.\n As far as the third question is concerned I don't have, unfortunately, that letter available to me that the Commissioner has referred to but I guess if that was what Gqozo has stated in that letter he might have referred to the so-called informal alliances that existed in Codesa.  And then maybe I should just for a moment refer to that and inform the Commission that at the time of Codesa, between Codesa 1 and Codesa II, that was between December and May, December of '91 and May of '92, there existed an informal alliance that consisted on the one side of the ANC and its formal alliance partners, namely the SACP and COSATU, together with a number of other parties, I think they were \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n48 R MEYER\nall in all seven or eight parties that were on the side of the ANC, an informal alliance as far as the negotiations are concerned.  Similarly on the side of the then government there was also an informal alliance consisting of seven or eight parties and it's true that the Ciskean government was one of those parties in that grouping.  There were also other parties for instance the Homeland parties of KwaZulu Natal, I am sorry, yes the IFP was there of course, but other Homeland parties like for instance the Deconquetla from the old Kwa Kwa, Shimoko from Gazankulu and a number of others and the Ciskean Government was also part of that grouping and I think that is maybe what Gqozo has referred to.",

I think if one looks at the video which, if one can get a copy of the video for the Commission from the South African Police I think that the position will become very much clearer for you.  As far as I recall it the position was that the marchers broke away from the official designated route, through the gap, over a grassed approach\nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n52 SENATOR RADUE\nto the stadium wall, there is no wall there, there is a grass verge, ran over and into the stadium, a number of them following Mr Kasrils, and it was only when they crossed the field and emerged at the far end through another tunnel in the stadium that the shooting commenced on the Bisho side.  Subsequently, probably through panic and I think one has also to have reference to not only the Goldstone Commission's report but also to the report commissioned by Brigadier Gqozo and he probably will refer to it at some stage of Judge Pickard, who also was commissioned to have an investigation and made certain findings, it seems that once the firing commenced on the Bisho side that the troops in front of the Parliamentary complex panicked and open fire on the innocent crowd that was still on both sides of the boundary.",

How is it possible that the victims will be led through the road of reconciliation?
