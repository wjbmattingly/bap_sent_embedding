We also have Mr Craig Padayashee, Local Government and Housing MEC.  Also Ms Candice Mashego Health Welfare and Gender, but also coordinator of the Local TRC Committee and who has been extremely helpful and kind to us.  I would also like to welcome Mr L Chiwayo who is the MEC for Sports Recreation Arts and Culture, and later on tonight when we are so tired from the whole day you can give us some recreation. Thank you.  Mr Peter Sanders who is the mayor of White River, and then finally the Deputy Speaker of the legislature Ms Cynthia Maropeng.  I wonder if all of those people could just stand for one moment just so that we can recognise you and welcome you, all those names that I have stated.  Thank you very much.  Some of them may still be outside, please tell them I did welcome them.  So let's start now.  Thank you very much indeed.  To those of you who have come during tea you are very welcome indeed.  We have tried to say that witnesses should be heard in silence irrespective of whether you like what they say or you don't like what they say they have a right to tell their story.  Now to start with I am going to call Msongelwa Amos Maseko.  Please come forward.  Mr Maseko may I welcome you on behalf of the Commission. Please speak up as loudly as you can so that everybody can take part.  You have a very tragic story\nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n2 M A MASEKO\nas well to tell about yourself and what happened to you also in 1986 and in order for the taking of the oath and to assist you in the telling of your story I will ask my colleague Jasmin Sooka to take over from me.

            "This started with the uprisings in the Lowveld region.  We were at school and we left the school premises.  I have to say that the pupils from Kalipane and Stintile High Schools were arrested during those uprisings and they were arrested and sent to the cells in Kapukwene(?) Prison.  On the 10th of March in 1986 we went to the Pukwene Magistrate Court where we were supposed to support the students.  Kapukwene it's a very small place to accommodate all the students.  Police arrived with barbed wire and they fenced the area so that the students that were inside the Kapukwene Magistrate's Court area could not leave anymore.  But the students were not satisfied with this situation and they tried by all means possible to force their way through the barbed wire into the magistrate's court.  The policemen started shooting.  It was on the 10th of March 1986.  It was the day of the Lowveld massacre.\n On the 22nd, which was the following week, it was a Friday, and we were told that everybody should go to the stadium, it was going to be for the arrangements for the funerals of the Lowveld massacre victims.  On that Friday we were at Kwanyamizani Stadium for the night vigil and in the NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 M A MASEKO\nmorning at about 5:30 to 6:00 we were all supposed to disperse to go home so that we can prepare ourselves for the funeral proceedings which was to take place at 10 o'clock on Saturday morning the 23rd.  When we went to the stadium on Friday there were buses transporting everybody who wanted to go to the night vigil.  \n On Saturday morning we didn't have transport and many of us decided to move from Kwanyamizani to Pienaar, we decided to walk.  We left the stadium heading for Pienaar.  While we were at Kwanyamizani we met three police vans, powder blue in colour.  They were from the White River direction.  All three vans were filled with White policemen.  They were heading to the stadium and we were going from the stadium to Pienaar.  They didn't give any warning, they just started shooting.  They used teargas at first and there was a crossroad where they turned and that is where I also got injured because I just fell.  I wasn't tripped I just fell and I realised that my shirt was full of blood.  Another person came, I don't know if he was from the neighbourhood, he was driving in a private car and he took the two of us to Temba Hospital.  But before he could get out of Pienaar the people said to him you aren't going to drive in Pienaar please use the alternate road.  \n We were then taken to Temba Hospital and I was admitted on the 23rd of March 1986.  One of the pellets got into my eye but when I was admitted to the hospital other pellets were removed but the other one was right inside the pupil and Doctor Steyn was responsible for the eye ward and I spent days in the hospital from the 23rd of March until July, I can't remember when it was in July, and I was then discharged.\nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n4 M A MASEKO",

We have said over and over again that we wish it was possible for those who have done the damage on any side of the conflict to be present when people like you and others who we have heard today tell their stories.  We are still hoping very much that perpetrators, who themselves are carrying a very heavy load, should still come before the Commission so that both victim and perpetrator should be healed.\n You have also reminded us, as have others, of the very high cost that young people have paid in leading up towards a new South Africa with a new democracy, with new opportunities, and one of the main objectives of the \nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n8 M A MASEKO\nCommission is to make sure that what happened to you and so many others like you throughout the country will not happen again.
