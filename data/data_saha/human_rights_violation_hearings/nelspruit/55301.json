            "In 1986 on the 16th of June it was a Sunday.  Comrades came into my home.  I was at home together with the members of my family. They wanted our brother here and he was not available and they said they discussed something because there were a lot of girls outside. And then they said Phindile should walk out.  Then I went underneath the bed and another boy came in and then he said, \"They are not in here\". And they found Phumzile and Phumzile said, \"I can not go if Phindile is not accompanying me.\"  Then I had to come out.\n As we were walking and they were collecting other comrades, fetching them, we arrived at the 35's next to the butchery.  On our arrival there some soldiers came and they were using hippos.  Their lights were on and then we went to another house and then they passed there and went out trying to fetch every comrade from each house. At the park we had to come together there, up till six. \n At round about 12 at night one boy said he can see people and behind you there are soldiers. And we were about to go and celebrate about June 16 and then from there we had to eat. I could not eat because really I was not feeling well, it was chilly that night, I did not wear enough warm clothes.\n From there, on that mountain I slept.  After that I woke up and then I said to them, \"Let's go, we are going to Section Six\". Before we could reach any further there were a Cabasa group and some soldiers and they started shooting at us.  As I was shot at I did not feel anything whether I was injured.  I only felt something cold because I was shot by pellets.  After that they shot at me at the knee and the other side of the knee also.  I could not walk and they only NELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 NQOBE\nhad to lift me up and they allowed me to jump the fence.  The other one was allowed to take me. I felt that I was injured but I could not see actually where I was wounded.  Then I asked another boy to knock at one of the houses there in order to get assistance.  As we entered the house I was bleeding heavily and my colleague who was also wounded was also bleeding. And then they undressed us.  They were trying to make contact with our family members.  It couldn't help.  Then from there we saw another boy who was just outside who was also injured but they could not be assisted because there were a lot of soldiers and the Cabasas.\n And this boy was beaten and he was screaming until death. And as we were feeling that pain after some time it was around about one or two o'clock. Another person came out to assist us with transport and then they took us with a combi, we were four, two boys, two girls.   They took us as the soldiers were following us, we reached Temba.  As we were waiting for admission there and the soldiers refused that we should be admitted at a hospital, the other soldiers said we had better be taken to the grave yard and be buried alive. And the other one said, \"No they cannot go with the sister.\"  Then he phoned the police station that they should come and fetch us, and as we arrived at the police station at Nelspruit, on our arrival they did not say anything to us.  They just put us in a cell.  As we were sitting there waiting, the following day we were called in. Two girls, it was myself and the other girl and the two boys, and they asked a lot of questions.  We could not answer those questions and those boys were beaten and we were slapped at our faces.  And they said we will only be released after fourteen days, yet we were injured and not given treatment.  NELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n4 NQOBE\n After that we remained at the police station and the food was very irregular to us and although our parents did try to bring some food, it could not reach us. Now the other day they took us with the other colleague of mine and they said we should go and check some corpses at the mortuary and they opened there.  Then they said to us we must identify those corpses and we said there was no one we could identify.  They took us back in the cell.\n After that, after fourteen days we were then released home.  We then started to receive treatment.",

You told us that you were injured, you were shot and you were taken to the hospital and instead of being treated you were followed by the police and they took you to the prison and you were there for fourteen days. Now you say in your statement that during those 14 days you received no medical treatment, that you stayed in your clothes which were blood stained because you were bleeding from the ribs and from the knee.  I want you to think very hard. Did no doctor that worked in the prison, did nobody come to see you during those 14 days at all?",

Don't let anything stop you. Make something of your life, don't be a victim for ever because it wasn't your fault.  You were just a youngster, you were caught up in all the happenings at that time, there were some very evil things taking place in our country. We have now moved and we are very very hopeful that young people like yourself and your friends can make a new start and give new courage for a new South Africa.  I hope you will be able to do that.  Thank you very much indeed, it's not easy to come and speak in front of all these people, and we are very grateful to you. We hope you go well, thank you.",
