            "It was in 1986, in May on the 12th.  We were going to the cemetery.  The proceeding was normal on our way to the cemetery.  There was no problem at all.  While we were at the cemetery the ceremony was already done and then we were told that the elderly people should go, and I followed.  On the way they trapped me and I was called back to the cemetery and they said only the elderly people should go and I decided to go back to the cemetery, and the ceremony was completed in a traditional way and the police were that other side, waiting there, carrying their guns.\n I wanted to be on the forefront so that we can get \nNELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n2 MATHEBULA\noff the cemetery very early because I was scared and as I was walking, I was now in the middle of Spayville. I was crossing the bridge, I heard a loud noise behind me and I was scared to have a look. And as I was concentrating on the sound I have heard, I heard a very heavy blow behind me. I didn't know what happened, how did I fall, but when I regained consciousness I was in the hospital patted by white people. And when I asked as to what happened, they said you are arrested.  I asked them why and the answer was, \"You are being charged with public violence\".  I said, \"Was it a sin to go to the funeral?\".  They didn't give me an answer. They said, \"Bring the things that are at your back, they have to be removed\". They said they were taking me to the district jail.  They left with me and when we arrived at the police station I was taken to the cell. That was the first day.\n The second day, the third day and I was transferred to prison on the third day. I stayed three weeks.  They would be coming to check me, the person was Gerald, and they would continually ask me about my health and I would tell them that I am not feeling well, I am not really feeling well and they would console me, and after the three weeks that I stayed in prison, the said the case would be heard and the bail was R50.\n Gerald and Comfort came to bail me out with the R50 and I was now released on bail.  I didn't stay long. Now this thing that they used to hit me at the back affected my whole body and I became sick. I was at home feeling sick and at home I was taken to the hospital by the family members. I don't know how I reached the hospital because I was losing consciousness all the time and they decided to carry me to\nNELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 MATHEBULA\nthe hospital. \n I don't remember how many weeks did I spend in the \n 3 hospital.  I don't think it was a week, it was just a few \ndays and the family members were called into the hospital because I wasn't speaking any more.   They came to check me, they took me with.  I was taken to Rockfell and I was taken to special doctors.  They wanted to check as to what happened to my body actually and they were told that the\nbullets had been removed from my back and the doctor checked me, examined me once more.  They didn't know what was happening and they had to operate me on the stomach.  And they said my intestines were just mixed up. I was really injured. I stayed some time in the hospital, the case was waiting in the middle because I was charged with public violence and I was told that I should appear before the court of law. And I was in the hospital then.\n The first case was remanded.  I was now trying to sit because I couldn't sit before. After I was given a few therapeutic lessons on sitting, we went on to the second stage of standing. Steady but sure I tried my best and I was much better and the family was called in again.  Together with my brother in law we left the hospital and the sister next to me was also there. They took me to their place so that they can always take care of me.\n Time went by. The day of the court hearing arrived. I was made to stand in the court of law and was charged for hitting the police vans with stones. I said, \"Where did I throw stones at the police vans?\"  I said,\" How could I throw stones because you shot me from behind. Why couldn't you shoot me at the front?\"  I couldn't get an answer to that question. They stood on their statement that I threw \nNELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n4 MATHEBULA\na police van with stones. The case was remanded once more. At on stage we went to the court of law, it was the second \nand I was sent, I think it was the third time, they said I was sentenced to four years. I couldn't answer, I couldn't do anything. I just got blank because I had my husband, I had a child and why would I pick stones and throw them at a police van? I knew that I didn't do it.\n I left my family under those circumstances. I went to prison.  When I was in prison, the family came together and they said, \"Can we try to organise an appeal?\" Yes an appeal was organised, it was well accepted by the Court but the time was so limited and I had to go back to the cells. Then the family members were told to come and fetch me the next day.  The next day they came to fetch me and I went back home. I stayed six months at home, knowing that I didn't do anything.  I had hoped that when the results of the appeal were out, not be found guilty, I would not go back to prison, I would go back home, take care of my child. But things turned the other way round.\n It was on the 22nd of July, Hiski came to me and he said they want you inside. He gave me a letter, he said, \"You should go and spend your days once more in the prison\". And he said to me, \"When you go in for detention, take this letter with you\".  I became helpless, I didn't know what to do.  They took me with this letter and I was taken to the cells.  \n Because of all these things that happened to me, I am always sick.",

            "I was welcome back in prison,\nNELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n5 MATHEBULA\nbecause I tell you I got a very warm welcome because the people in the prison knew my situation, they knew my conditions.  Since that day I have never been a healthy person any more.\nI spent those years in prison as they charged me but before even six months that I spent in the prison I was attacked by high blood pressure and I fell sick and I lay in bed. I was taken to the doctor and he  ken to the doctor and he diagnosed me as having high blood pressure and he ordered them not to disturb me in any way.\nI was undergoing treatment very often.  I spent three years in prison.\n They said, \"Because you have been charged with public \nviolence, we are not going to cut your years, you are going to spend four years in prison. And when Mr Mandela was released, I was given mercy, one year was cut off. I was released on the 22nd of July in 1990 and I was released. But when they released me they released me with this terminal illness in me. \n When I went back home I kept on attending medical treatment. I was attending Bobitt before I was taken to prison, I went to Sally and he was the person who was really getting the cure of what was taking place in my life.  Even today I still feel that there are parts in my body that are not well and I just go to him, I'm a regular customer now.  I cannot work, I cannot do anything.  If I try to do anything the hand is painful.  When I try to do \nanything, the arm is hurting, the leg, my stomach, everything.  I went to him and he checked me. He used a machine to check me and he said there was a hole in my bladder and I just looked at him as he was telling me this.  He said, \"Please do not get disturbed by what I'm telling NELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n6 MATHEBULA\nyou now\".  And I kept quiet. He was telling me this and there were things that I could see on my body.  There were bullets on my body and I was scared to go to the hospital to let them be removed. I told  myself that this was something from God, I had to accept it. God raised his hands and he protected me.  He didn't want me\nto leave this earth but I must tell you the pain is still with me and my body is damaged. I am well today, tomorrow I  am not.  Even at work, where I am working, because I realised that I was at all times sick. My employer said, I'm now going to reduce the days.  I said to him, \"Well that will be the way I have to accept, I lost my family, I lost my house, I lost my belongings, I lost everything. When I came back from prison, everything, my future was destroyed and this is disturbing me a lot.  People have places of their own where they can sleep when it's cold. I cannot sleep, I don't have a house, I don't have a home. I was innocent. I went to a funeral of our neighbour, Duty Embata. We wanted to bury her son and that is where I met my fate.
