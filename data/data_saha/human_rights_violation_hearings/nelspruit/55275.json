We went past one passage and we didn't know that the police were always around that passage. As we were passing we heard a gun fire. I didn't know that when someone is shooting or when you hear NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA\n2 MS N N MABUZA\ngun fire what to do. We were many.  Three of us died and some of us got hurt. One of the people who got injured is my brother next to me. \n After that we were taken to hospital, Shongwe Hospital.  When we arrived there they could not treat me. They transferred me to Numbele Hospital. At Numbele Hospital they also failed.  They transferred me to Rob Ferreira, and Rob Ferreira also failed. I was transferred to Garankuwa. I had 11 bullets in my body.  One in my hand, one in my arm, one in my rib, spinal cord, 11 the total of them.  \n Those bullets were the result that I am paralysed today.  Even up today it is difficult for me to go and pass urine on my own. I have a problem.  I can't even go for a short distance without messing myself. After that, when I came back from hospital, when I was discharged, it was difficult. I have to go for medication from time to time. I went for neuro-surgery and they also brought me for physio-therapy at Rob Ferreira Hospital. \n They gave me some walking sticks to try and walk.  I was also transferred to hospital. There I met Dr Van Graan.  One doctor said to me there is no space for patients. They have a shortage of beds. I was supposed to be transferred to Shongwa Hospital. Also Shongwa Hospital had the same problem, a shortage of beds. I was discharged. I went back home. \n I would also like to be like the rest, to be like other girls. I want to go to school. I want to be in a nicer place. I am no longer staying at home, because I was injured. I am no longer staying at home.",

Then we heard gun fire and I was shot in my stomach when I tried to run.  Another bullet hit my leg. I fell down and I could hear some gun fire. When I woke up I\nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA\n4 MS N N MABUZA\nsaw whites and then I realised that I was at the wrong place.   I went back. I was looking for water.  When I arrived there I saw - I went to a car in a scrap-yard. I saw an ambulance and those people at the ambulance were looking for people who were injured. I tried to scream.  Because I wanted them to see me. I said I am here.  I heard one boer saying where is this guy.  When I said I am here, I asked them why were you shooting at us.  So they said to me no, you came to burn my house.  So I said to them why do you think I was going to burn your house because I am not smoking, I don't have matches, I don't have anything with me. You can search me.  They said okay then, they left me there. \n The ambulance took me to Shongwa Hospital.  At Shongwa Hospital they transferred me to Ngodini Hospital. After Ngodini I was discharged.\n From that day my life started ... Most of the time I will try to lead my life clean. I was one boy who like to play soccer.

Only to find that he did not sleep there. Then I went back home and I informed my husband that well, he is nowhere to be found.  Then he said what must I do. I said let's go around.

As we arrived at Naas, we asked another boy and this boy said to us no, go to Komatipoort.  \n We then went to Komatipoort station although we did not have any money.  I had to get money from home before getting to Komatipoort. On our arrival there we went to the police station.  The police said no, go there, they are there where we are keeping the corpse. He was not there, because he was too small.  Then we said to them he is not there.  \n We went back home again.

            "In 1986 while we were fast asleep, I heard them singing. They were singing slogans.  Some children outside.  Now my child came out of the house, to join them. As he was going, I heard a gun sound at Naas township. It was round about nine at night. It was not yet dark.  The others were singing then. They were shooting.  Shooting in the air. Then from there a few minutes therafter some came running, and they came knocking at my door. As they were knocking at my door, they said I must come out of the house.  Then I woke up. Then I said to myself what has happened now with my child.  Then they said to me let's go.  I discovered my boy was almost dead.  I cried there, where he lay. After that he said to me no, don't cry, Mamma, I won't die.  I discovered that the bullet went inside the right leg and the other bullets went inside the body, from the back.  From there we took him to the clinic at Mongweni. At our arrival there they transferred him to Shongwa Hospital. At Shongwa Hospital they did not help him.  During that night they had to transfer him to Nongeni Hospital.  On his arrival there there was nothing that could assist him.\n Now I am told that there were six soldiers who were actually guarding him at the hospital.  As they were guarding, surrounding the bed, if they wanted to assist him to remove the bullets, these soldiers refused. If he was asking for water and the soldiers refused that he should be given water.  At the end they were just guarding and \nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA\n14 MRS THEBELA\nsurrounding him in the bed.  From there he died.\n When we went there we discovered that he has already passed away.  Then we asked.  Well, they said to us he is dead already.  \n We said we wanted to see his whereabouts. They refused.  Later on we went back again. I think it was almost after a week, we went there. On our arrival there they took us, they told us where he was kept.  They removed the clothes which he had on.  We said to them they had better transfer him from Ngondeni Hospital. They refused.  They said no, he cannot be transferred, because these people are actually prisoners. We had to ask a question;  whom did they kill, why, what's wrong with them, because they have never killed anybody.  These people were just singing and they tried to join them and they were shot at.  They were young in fact at that stage. They only joined their friends.  Then they transferred them to Nelspruit mortuary.  \n Actually it was said that we are not going to get the corpse, because they have done something wrong against the government.  We asked the question; what wrong have they done.  They were refusing that we should have the corpses for the funerals.  Until to a stage where we had to take this matter up with the high authorities.  Then they released them.\n The day came for the funeral.  We went, we had a funeral, a mass funeral.  As we were waiting for them, they brought them.  Then we went to the stadium where the mass funeral was to be held.  Actually on that day it was sort of like a rally.  But to us, who were affected, it was painful.  But people were laughing, some were singing and after that they said well, we can take the corpse for the funeral.\nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA\n15 MRS THEBELA\n At the burial there, nothing was given to us.

Was the evidence about the shooting not having taken place, not having taken place from Mangezi's home but from a car.  I guess that was news to you when you heard Anthony talk about that. The question as to the purpose of the party when you heard Nonsa speak, that it was simply to say good-bye to students going back to boarding school.  That must have also been news or have you heard those versions before?",

            "... that we should remain here for this hearing for almost four days, listening from different stories of some incidents that took place between - incidents that happened from 1966 to 1993.  Now the hearings here that took place, I would say, it is almost similar to any other hearing, to try and find out the truth. We heard from the witnesses the way they were tortured in different ways. We heard from the witnesses giving statements, that they have been troubled, some were tortured, some were troubled by the SADF and some were actually, the comrades, some were actually under the UDF.  The organisation now which has been the ANC.  We also learnt quite a lot of things, about some of the things that were actually done by the group known as Khabasa.  Some told us that they were actually - had problems while they were in camps of the African National Congress.  Now we are taking all what we have gathered here to the investigating unit, and we hope that unit is going to assist us to clarify some of the issues which were not clarified.\n As a Commission we want to invite all the people from the Mpumulanga Province, that the process which we have started, should give you courage, that people should come forward and give in statements.  Before we can come to a region, we believe that we first have to check how many statements have been presented. If there are no statements \nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA\n23 MR NGOLBENI\nwe cannot simply say we are going to Leandra or we are going to Barberton.  We are going there determined by the statements which have already been forwarded.  We think you are going to hand in hand with the committee.  The statements that are going to be received will determine where the hearings will be.\n This Commission also have amnesty hearings. We also invite, more especially people from the Mpumulanga Province, those who know very well that actually in a way they are affected in violating other people's rights, they should come forward.  They must fill out those forms, they must come forward, and say what they have done in the past.\n I think you will realise that there are lots and lots of people who are always saying, they say here I will only get peace the time when I am going to hear from someone who is asking forgiveness. I still call upon you to work hand in hand with the amnesty people. I want to emphasise. There is also a dead-line date, according to the Act. That date is a cut-off date for those people who would like to appear before the amnesty committee.  It is the 14th of December 1996.\n If you don't come forward before this period, well, it would be hard luck for him or her.  Because he may have to appear before a court of law.  Yet, these hearings were meant actually that a person should also be in a position to ask for amnesty. The whole aim here is to reconcile.  \n After this cut-off date of the 14th, you may find yourself in trouble or appear before a court of law.\n The other thing, lastly, which I would like to mention here, we invite all the people, more especially who are members of the NGO and maybe those who are the officials in \n23 MR NGOLBENI\n24\nthe education field, to assist more especially those people who are making statements, and help them and assist them in any way.  Things which cannot come from the Commission but sort of assist them in a way, what can be done before answers can be obtained from the Commission.\n Something that can also sort of assist, more especially those are leaders of the community, people should realise something or become aware of something that they can do, than just sitting and waiting for the results of the Commission.\n We are really calling upon you to assist in that regard.  There are many things that can be done.  As a Commission we want to thank you all.  We will request you that Rev Ntembu will come forward. He will have a way to do it, maybe by way of prayer.  We thank you.",
