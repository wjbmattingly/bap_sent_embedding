            "During the year 1986 she was actually a worker at one of the farms, Braham.  On that day she was travelling from work back home. We were expecting her as we normally expect her on Sundays.  Now she got a lift and she was coming home, she was actually coming home as usual on Sundays. On that day she met with an accident between Karino and Nelspruit.  There the bomb blasted. Lindiwe had a small child with her, she was eight months old during that bomb blast. What happened, the message was only received on Monday in the afternoon at around about three o'clock, that something had happened to her.  In that incident my child was also involved and those people who were actually watching TV news, saw her and they recognised her.  The person actually came to inform me was actually a person working at the hospital at Robs Ferreira.\n I felt very hurt about my daughter, the way she passed away.  I did not expect that my child should leave me in this fashion.  The bomb blast, I only heard of it, you know I never knew about it, I only heard of it over the radio but I never expected that it should come and injure my child in NELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 SEGAGE\nthis fashion. Lindy was actually my first daughter. Lindiwe left behind two children at home. \nEven today they are still there those children and I'm actually find it very difficult to raise them. The father to the children is also not a healthy person. Lindy was actually the source of income to us, she was bring food to our house.  Now that she died, we no longer have food because she was actually the  person working. I now go around working in order to gain income for the children and we actually struggled with my husband to raise them.  Now I feel very much hurt, I'm asking the Commission to investigate what should be done because really I was very much worried about the death of my child. My child died in a very, she was actually burned, her hair was burned, there was nothing. Both legs were actually damaged and the legs were just collected, it was just flesh or pieces.  That thing does not go away, I still remember, I still relive that incident.  That's why I 'm here today to say this in front of you.",
