I took my wife, that is her mother, and then we went to the hospital to check as to what happened to her and truly she was shot.  We left the hospital and went back home.  When I arrived at home I stayed a short while and went straight to the police station and I wanted to see the station commander himself, and I was taken to him.  I was talking to him, telling him that my daughter has been shot, can he please furnish me with the reasons why she was shot.  The station commander couldn't give me an answer.  I asked him again.  If they shot her on the face what did they use to shoot my daughter?  The station commander said, pellets.  I asked him what are these pellets, are they iron or rubber?  The station commander said they are iron.  I said what if my daughter is not going to see again?  He said no we don't\nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 P MALOMA\nknow, we will see when things turn out that way. That was the station commander's words.  Today my daughter doesn't see.  She has lost everything, her future as well.  Till when is she going to suffer this way?  Now the thing that is in my heart I will request the Truth Commission and the Government of the day I want help with regards to my child.  She should be cared for.  What kind of help can she be offered in this life?  And the people who shot at her should come forward and they should tell us the reasons why they shot at my daughter and maybe I will have peace.  I will stop there.  Thank you.",

We don't understand it.  We don't know why this happened, but many, many people have come to us and have lost either the sight of one eye or both eyes, and people have been plunged into darkness, sometimes at a very young age.  You were only 15 when this happened to you.  You are still a young person.  I think we would like to encourage you to find a new meaning in life in terms of work, you mentioned you want to continue your schooling, you mentioned that you would like to learn to type, we will make enquiries and we will be in touch with yourself or with your father to see how we can help to make some opportunities for training to take on new life that even in the darkness there can be some light.
