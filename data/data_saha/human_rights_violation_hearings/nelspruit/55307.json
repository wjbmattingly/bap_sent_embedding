            "My child was actually working at White River and from White River he came to Nelspruit municipal offices.  From there he went to Sasol.  From Sasol he came back and was retrenched and he was told that factory is now leaving for Cape Town.  When he came back after the retrenchment he was waiting here at home.  He stayed at home for almost two weeks.  On the third week he said to us no he cannot remain here at home because he cannot stay here without working.  He must go back and fetch his belongings and come back.  And\nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n2 SILINDA\non Wednesday he went to Sasol.  On his way back from Sasol at night, at 12 o'clock he came home.  He went into his room and he slept there.  While he was sleeping there in the morning at half past six there came a lot of boys and they said we want this boy, we are going for a meeting.  We are going for a meeting.  And my husband asked what is the meeting for and then they said no, don't ask, let's go.  He will get the information there.  And then he went out.  While they were together with him there and the boy woke up and he said why such a noise here.  And they said there is a meeting at Mr Ngwenya's place.  I don't know what is the meeting all about.  And they said it is a meeting for the comrades.  I don't know what is it for.  And then he said - and then they said did they take my father to go to the meeting and this boy jumped the fence and he went to the meeting.  On his arrival there I don't know what they discussed there.  I don't know actually because I was not there, I was at home.  They took my boy and other boys.  They took my boys, these boys are actually working at Mr Enus' place.  They went with them.  They came back again and then - and there were now all 12 in number.  They went with them.  They burnt them and my boy while they took an axe and they actually axed him on the head and he had long hair and this hair actually went inside in the wound so that - and then from there he ran to another home and at that home there were two boys and they looked at him and they said well they recognised him in fact because he once worked with these gentlemen at the municipal offices.  And then from there they ran to my home and on the arrival at home they said to me well stand up, Frank has been burnt to death.  Then I asked what wrong has he done,  they said no we don't\nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 SILINDA\nknow.  I then left, I went, I just decided to run and I crossed the river and behind the other men called me, they said please come back, where are you going to.  I said no I have heard that my son had been burned, they said no, come on we have seen a person running from the other direction burnt, his so black with ashes and thinking that it was my son I went back and I took another direction and I asked him I said what happened to you, who injured you.  And he said I do not know.  I don't know who the perpetrators of this act are.  And he said to me I don't know the people who burnt me.  I said to him not even one of you can identify the people who did this to you, and he said I will tell you tomorrow.  He said I will tell you when I arrive in the hospital.  I said to him please tell me.  You said to me you know the perpetrators.  He only opened his mouth like a bird and then closed his mouth again and his eyes were now turning their colour and I cried.",
