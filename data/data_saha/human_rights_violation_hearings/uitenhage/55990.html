<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, I now ask Vuyiswa Virginia Belesi as the next witness.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Good morning Ms Belesi.  Can you hear me over the head phones?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Good.  Welcome here.  Your story relates to the death of your son, Phumzile Gladwell Belesi, during 1989, another victim of the conflict that we are hearing about today.  Would you like to tell us what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> I was sleeping and it was in the morning, then there was a knock at the door and some commotion and noise, then I stood up to open the door and young men and boys asked for Phumzile and I knew the one that was asking, his name is Dugisowasi, then I directed him to the front room and they talked to him and I don't know what they were talking about.  Then they said that he should wake up and join them and Phumzile washed his face and got into the house and took a small kerrie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a> That was the last I saw of him and there was commotion during the day and they did not come back and we could see some ambulances moving up and down and the day went on and he wasn't coming.  Then I panicked and I decided to sent his girlfriend to go to hospital, to go and look for him.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>Phumbla and Notando went to hospital and when they got back, they said that they did not see Phumzile, but then there was a rumour that there were some that were in Livingstone in Port Elizabeth, so the following day I went to Livingstone hospital and they said that there was no such person there, but I looked for him for a long time and then I gave up and went back home.  When I got home, the wife Tumpeli, he called me and said to me that he had heard that Phumzile had died on that very day and so he opted to accompany me to go to Kay Street to look for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> So I was accompanied by another woman from no.24, this is a woman I used to help, so she accompanied me to Kay Street and I described him according to his attire but I was scared to get in, so the woman who was with me went inside and she saw him and so that is how I got his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Can I just ask you some questions just to try and clarify what actually happened.  Was it on the 28 December 1989 when the group of youths came and called Phumzile with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> Yes, that is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Was that at your house at No.9 Hinsel Road in Kwanubushle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> You mean to come and get him.  Yes, they knocked at my house and they asked for Phumzile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Now, what was Phumzile doing, was he working or was he at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> He was working at BA, together with his father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Can you give us an idea of what his age was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> He was born in 1968, on the 9 September.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Did he have any children?</p>

<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>mother was still pregnant and this child is living with me at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Has he got two children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> No, he was got one child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> You say that the mother of the child was pregnant when Phumzile was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> Yes, that is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> ...that child now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> It is me because I am bringing this child up and the child stays with me, the mother left the child when he was 3 months old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Did you find out how Phumzile was actually killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> From what I hear is that teargas was administered and they were chased by caspers and he was hit dead by a hippo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Was there ever any court case or an inquest concerning the death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> No, we never went to any court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Were you told officially who was responsible for the death, or officially told what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Is there anything that you would like to draw our attention to in particular, or that you want us to attend to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> I've got none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Don't you have difficulty in maintaining the child yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> I have difficulty because he attends school but I have a wish that I could get assistance towards his upbringing and towards his education because he happens to</p>

<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> If Phumzile was run over by a police vehicle, then one assumes that there must be some official record of that, would you wish the Commission to look into that issue and find out what has actually happened there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS BELESI:</span> Yes, that is my wish only if it is not going to hurt me more.</p>
