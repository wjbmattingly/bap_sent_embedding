That was in February, but I still could not work properly and even my employers did not give me good treatment together with the management because they accused me of being talkative. They were even telling me that I could not enjoy the privileges that were enjoyed by the other staff members and this used to hurt me because they used to warn me repeatedly, even if we would have stayed away from work as a group, as we were members of the union then they would tell us that if we don't report to work they were going to get someone to work for me.\n So, all the time they would call me to their office to reprimand me and I could cry in front of the management.

But, our black mothers have endured a lot which perhaps could not have been endured by the other mothers. I therefore think that it should be in your mind that if your son was allowed to live he would perhaps be something in life.\n We thank you for this very painful story, I say it once more that I wish people who were in government at the time should be listening.\n We are going to look into your request and attend them and make a follow-up as much as we can, but I should ask the comment of the reparation to look into whatever assistance they could offer insofar as your health is concerned, because we feel that it needs an urgent attendance.
