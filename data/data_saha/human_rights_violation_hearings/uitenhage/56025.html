<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am going to thank the witnesses who we referred to this morning, who we spoke about this morning, but due to time constraints, we are going to proceed and call upon Notolo Regina Plaatjie, and ask her to take the stand.  Over to you Rev Xundu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">NOTOLO REGINA PLAATJIE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Ms Plaatjie, the evidence that you are going to give this afternoon before this commission is about your brother, Matthews Lindile Faku.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You said that your brother left South Africa in 1961, and he left home saying that he is going to fight for the struggle outside.   Can you just give us an idea who Lindile was so that we can speak about somebody that we know, what kind of person he was and what his position was in the struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> Lindile Faku was in the struggle with my parents, Mr and Mrs Faku.  When he left in 1961, I was at  my marital home, but when he left home, he said that he was working at Industecs and he was to go in at 5:50, but he knew that he was leaving.  He left for work, took his shirt and left for work, and he did not come back home at 6 o'clock when he normally came back, he didn't come back from UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>2 N PLAATJIE</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>work, and my mother waited and he saw Mr Makidwana and Tebe coming and Mrs Chaka, and they said Mrs Faku, we have come to let you know, please do not worry, that your son has crossed the border, please do not tell too many people this, do not even tell your children, rather keep it under wraps, and that is how my brother left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a> One day, while I was at home in Dumbaswa because my mother had been arrested and had been put in jail for 7 years, when they were released, they were released to Dembaswa because they were told that they can not stay here in Port Elizabeth, so we had to move to Dembaswa and I was at home because my mother had been in custody at the time so my father was there.  My father then said to me, you must please turn on the radio at 12 o'clock, you are going to hear your brother singing.  At 12 o'clock that night, I switched on the radio, and tuned into the station that my father had told me about and I heard my brother singing these songs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you remember which station this was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> No, I have forgotten it, because it was a long time ago.  No, I have forgotten which station it was which the people who were involved in the struggle used to tune in to.  My father used to know which one it was.  And that was the last time I heard about him, and thereafter, when my mother returned from jail, she had suffered a stroke in prison, and when she came back from jail, she passed away after 2 weeks in Dembaswa because after the stroke she had a stomach ailment and she passed away and she was survived by my father.  My father also passed away without having any idea where this child was and at a time where the exiles were returning home, we thought we was also going to come</p>

<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>back, and now the reason I am here today is because I see that everyone else has come back except him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Let us just go back to your mother, why was she arrested, so that she served 7 years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> She was involved in the struggle.  They used to burn corpses because they said that they should take them to Strydom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Which year was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> I don't know, it was many many years ago.  I can not even remember.  It was Mrs Matomela and Mrs Bart, they were all arrested at the same time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you remember, since you brother left, saying that he is going to join the struggle on the outside, which organisation he was affiliated to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> He was a member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You mentioned Mr Tebe and Mr Makidwana, what were they, as far as you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> They were also members of the ANC.  This is Mr Makidwana next to me, he is also a witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did your brother keep in touch with you people.  Did you know where he was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> No, I just heard from my father that I should tune into the radio that night and listen to his voice on the radio, but he never wrote to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What made you sure that he was on the outside.  Was it that you heard him on this radio station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> Yes, and also these people that had helped him cross the border came to tell us that he had crossed the border and that we should not worry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> And after they had told you that he had left, would they during the years, tell you that he was still</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>4 N PLAATJIE</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>alive, and where he was and so forth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> No, they never told us over the years but at the time that we were at Dembaswa, when this other group came back, Mr Tebe's son said that our brother is still alive and that he is still there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What year did you last hear him on the radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> That is why I say that I can not remember any more, it was a long time ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Mr Makidwana and Mr Tebe, or anybody from the organisation, when last did anybody hear any information about your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> Mr Makidwana and Mr Tebe were the ones that said that they had helped him across the border, and my mother was then in jail and she came to Dembaswa thereafter, Mr Makidwana was the one that came back to Port Elizabeth after his release from jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Since you knew that your brother was in the ANC did you attempt at all, after the unbanning of the organisation, to try and establish where your brother was and what happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> I phoned once when Lindile Faku came from this rural village and somebody had given me a number, telling me to phone this number.  I phoned him and asked them about Lindile Faku, and I was told that this Lindile Faku had been fetched by his sister and that he lived in a village and I wanted to know about our Lindile Faku who had left and this person said to me, Ma'am, a lot of people haven't returned yet, wait for him, he probably will come back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> As far as you know was he in the ANC, this person that was telling you that many people haven't returned yet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> Yes, these were the numbers of the office that UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>5 N PLAATJIE</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>I had been given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you have names of people that you had spoken to at this ANC office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> No, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You mentioned somewhere that somebody said to you that your brother had moved up in the ranks of the ANC, outside, which meant that he would come back long after other people because he still had work that he had to finish.  Who told you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> Mr Tebe's son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Have you spoken to Mr Tebe's son thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> No, I haven't seen him yet because he is in Dembaswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Haven't you heard anything more about your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is there anything else that you would like to say, in addition to your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIE:</span> I would like the Truth Commission to please investigate for me and to try and establish what happened to me brother so that at least we can know where he is so that if he is not alive we would like to know where his bones are lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you very much Ms Plaatjie, I am going to hand over to the Chairperson of the Commission,  maybe they have some questions that they would like to put to Mr Makidwana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much, the questions that we do have, have been put to you by Ms Maya, and we do not have any more questions, but I would like to assure you that last week we did meet with political parties where they had been</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>6 N PLAATJIE</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>making submissions and one of the things that we observed was the questions that were put to them by parents, more so to the ANC organisation about children that hadn't returned from exile.  The ANC has assured us that they will cooperate with us in every way so much so that they will give us a list of the names of the people who died while in their camps and assured us that they will help us in answering peoples questions about what happened to their loved ones and make whatever information they can available to us, so we will handle your request accordingly and try and establish what happened to your brother, and why he did not return when everyone else returned.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a> We would like to assure you of that because there are many instances that we come across in these hearings, similar to this one of yours, where it becomes evident that some people come back and others don't and that there is no explanation from the organisation that goes to the parents to explain to them what happened, so we will try by all means.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a> Thank you very much, you may go back to your seat.</p>
