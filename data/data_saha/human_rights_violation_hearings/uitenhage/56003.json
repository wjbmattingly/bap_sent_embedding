            "Thank you officials, parents, comrades and friends.  I feel privileged that I should give this brief summary about the incident that occurred here in Uitenhage at the time of the shooting of the people in Langa.  Firstly I would mention that it is of importance that we would see that the struggles and all the other incidents here in Uitenhage are not isolated from those that occurred in the country as a whole but the main aim was to change what was happening at the time.  Those times there were some reasons that made people to have the perception that there was war where South Africans were being attacked, which he refers to as the onslaught of the downtrodden.  They used to use some guns and also to tell lies and also to disturb peoples minds to cause conflicts and all this lead to the killing of one another.\n Many people were killed and these people used not to be able to explain why they were killing one another.  They would even feel embarrassed to tell what was the cause of their human right of living was taken away from the people.  Is was no longer a right, it was as if people did not have the right to live but is was as if it was a privilege that was granted to the people by the White government.  \n Lastly, what happened people were greatly affected.  Besides the 20 years of struggle from 1986 to 1986  which was divided in phases as people were trying to liberate themselves, we now have got to go back and look at the situation at the time of the shooting in Langa.\n In 1983 to 1984 the regime of the time made an indication of his determination toward the onslaught of the people and the UDF was published in 1984 and 1985, and therefore in 1985 the UDF was established and here in the \nUITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 F NKOBESE\nEastern Cape the UDF was seen as an obstacle and thought they could see who had established it with the aim to protect the people so the government was against this.\n In 1985 to 1986 the Uitenhage UDF became the target of the government of the time and when the PTSA's  were established they became targets and the enemy of the government.\n In 1986 to 1987 then there was a united force here in Uitenhage.  So this was the sequence of the phases which lead to all this.  The enemy of the people was making programmes according to it's needs at the time.  There were no policemen operating, the were no CID's, instead everybody who was employed by the government was made to fight against the people.  There were no divisions but they were fighting together against the people of Uitenhage.",

So it started off by the youth that was made to fight against each other and this lead on to the parents and no one knew what the cause of all this was but it started in school and it spread over to the locality to the parents and the education was disrupted.  This was the time when the PTSA's were being formed and then the enemy of the people became very jealous and then decided to disrupt this whole\nUITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n4 F NKOBESE\noperation.",

            "Thank you Mr Chairperson. Firstly this funeral was for the 8 victims that had been shot, those were even people from Despatch, and the funeral was going to be in Nogoblhe in one house in Mabahle in a family the Sisile.  So the government of the time sent a banning order that stated that this funeral was not to take place over the weekend when the people where all at home, but it had to be conducted on a week day.  So these families came together and they talked to their leaders and then they decided to abide by this banning order and the funeral was not going to be conducted on a weekend because they were in fear that the police were going to arrest and kill the people so they chose a week day for the funeral, according to the banning order.  Mr Chairperson, it happened that if we were to investigate we will find that this was a rare occurrence\nUITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n5 F NKOBESE\nthat though there was this decision that the funeral on week day and people were not going to work.  A day before the funeral some people were trying to counter the banning order that had been given out by the government and this is what led to this commotion.  At the time I was at the Mekosa office Comrade Denier who is the head of the security here in Bisho gave me a car and there was a telephone call that informed him that some people in Langa had been killed so I drove away.  Now the police gave this report that these people were shot because they were attending a funeral that was not there and yet there had been a banning order that had been read in Tsotsobe, Qwanubuhle and the people decided to abide by this banning order because they were in fear that they were going to be arrested.  \n Then the other day at night this banning order was changed that the funeral should be conducted on the week end so when people woke up ready to attend the funeral there was a committee, a burial committee that was making arrangements and they talked to the taxi man to transport the people then they talked to the bus company to transport the people and there was a lot of transport to carry the people so on this particular day the SADF stood down the road towards town and then they asked the people to alight  from the taxis they blocked the taxis, they blocked the buses and then there was a conflict because people wanted to find out why they were being made stranded.  All this time as they were walking they were accused as people who were intending to kill the White people.  So that is what happened.  \n So I am now going to address the questions that are going to be posts, and here with me I have some people who are going to give more detail.  There are questions here \nUITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n6 F NKOBESE\nlike, who gave out the first banning order, and according to what reasons.  Secondly is, who compiled the second banning order and according to what law was it set?  And what was the reason for the issue of the second banning order?  And why was this second banning order issued despite the first one that had already been issued and why was it given just a day before the funeral?\n How did it happen that the people in Uitenhage were made aware that there had been some changes that had been done over night?  Why therefore could the people in Langa not know exactly what was happening, who's fault was it?  Why was the committee that had been appointed by the community which was the burial committee not made aware of this second arrangement, and asked that they should go and explain to the people?  Why were the people who had boarded buses and taxis asked to walk and then implicated as people who were walking to town to go and kill the White people?   This came to us as a great surprise and we feel that is was sort of a big trap that had been set, because in a military style since there are many eye witnesses of this massacre why therefore was there a strategy that there should be ambulances, there should be some helicopters, there should be some policemen standing on guard, there should be some soldiers.",

I went into the Officials Department and before I could be allowed to see anyone there I would be blocked by a lot of soldiers that were dressed in uniform. They were all over the place, you couldn't even see the nurses and doctors.  It was just full of soldiers.  Then I was going to the ICU and I met a White policemen and he said he is the one and I then escaped and ran away without visiting the person I had intended to see so the hospital at the time was sort of a base for the soldiers that was after the massacre.  So the number of the dead people stated by the soldiers is just their choice. I now pause.
