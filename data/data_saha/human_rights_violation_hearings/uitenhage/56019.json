It was very bad, from 1985 and 1986 we couldn't sleep at night because there was war between Azapo and UDF.  We would get into bed dressed, even as parents.  Our children could not be at home for a long time, and I could see that Azapo and UDF were fighting because there White people who were making this conflict.\n My son at the time, as I was a worker, would come back, when he came from guarding.  They used to go out go guard.  On this particular day that is reflected there on the statement, which was in 1986, when this incident occurred, we chatted and it was after supper.  He just felt tired and he said that he did not want to take anything that they used to carry to defend themselves.\n The others came from the very same locality and it was at 9:00 at night and that was the time they used to go there.  Thought it was during the time of the state emergency, they would hide so that these policemen should not find them, because these policemen used to come to our houses and kick the doors so they would then go to those places that they used to keep guard.  So we would not sleep because we were scared of these White men.  It was really bad in Makaleni.  If you had a light on, you would close the window with a blanket so that they should not see the light.  If they would be attracted by any light they would kick the doors and they would come into your house to find out what you were doing at that time, was there a meeting perhaps.",

There were Hippos that were being driven all over the place and some cars and we would all be thinking of our children,\nUITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 N NDUNGANE\nbecause there was this battle that was very painful.\n I woke up on this particular day and went to work and I wanted to find out why I didn't see him and meet him at the gate as it usually happened.  So anyway, I left.\n So, I didn't meet him that day and I was unhappy at work because I wanted to find out the reason why he didn't come back.  We had heard some gun shots because Zide and Zykela are in the neighbourhood and we would hear all these gun shots.  I was unhappy.\n Then, at work I got a message that they wanted me at home.  I got into a car and these people in the car kept me busy because they could see that I was unhappy.  When I got home, I saw a crowd of people in me own yard only because my child had died.",

It was there when I got injured because I was still very upset.  I found a White policeman and one black policeman and we stated our problem and a Black policeman responded.  I still remember him, he was known as Faku.  I was still young, and he addressed me as a young girl, saying that you must not come and tell us that your son has been killed by Azapo, he was at war, therefore there is no case on this matter, we don't take such cases.

They did not want that there should UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n5 N NDUNGANE\nbe more than 5 people held together, they would ask, why we were holding these prayers.  They even said that these people had died because they had wanted to die.  I was also scared for my life.  There were some Whites that were patrolling, demanding about some books that I didn't even know about.
