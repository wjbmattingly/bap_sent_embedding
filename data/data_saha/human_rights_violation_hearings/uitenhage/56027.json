I add my words of welcome to those of the Chairperson and re-emphasise that the fact that your case is the last one for the day, doesn't make it less important than any of the other ones. It is just as important as any of the other cases that we have heard here today.\n You will tell us about your son Edgar Monwabisi Nqinqi who was killed by necklacing during September 1985. Would you like to tell us what you know, or what happened to Monwabisi?",

            "It was early on a Saturday at 6.30am and his brother Kenneth woke us up and said it would seem that they had killed, they had burnt Monwabisi.\n We woke up and my husband asked me to remain behind and they went there to the scene and they saw his body and identified him. They waited for the policemen who took his body away and came back. \n It was quite for some time with us not hearing anything and for about 10 months, it was quite, that was in 1986. At night we saw some light showing into our yard and we woke up. There was a knock at the door and there were two white policemen. They were detectives. We let them into the house. They asked for Thola or Ulani or Xtholile, then we said \"No, we don't have any of those except Xthola\". Then they asked where was he, then we said \"He is sleeping\", so they asked him to come and he came, then they said, \"No, we don't want one of this age\", because he was only 13, they said we want an older one, because in connection with the case of Monwabisi Nqiqhi who was set alight in Nginza. \n My husband then said, \"That is my son, that is my last born, I had sent him to the location to his Uncle on a Friday\". Then they said, \"No, we cannot take this one, he is under age\". So they left and time went on. \n After six months, we again heard another knock and it was very late at night and we opened the door and that was still in 1986 and it was Sgt. Pelser with Zibuko. They asked for Kenny, who was my eldest son, then I said he was \"voting\".\n They were going to send us a summons because we were going to court. We did receive the summons that they wanted my son and my husband to appear in court and they said there was a boy that had been arrested in connection with the incident of Monwabisi and he was under arrest.\n My husband and my son went to court and they saw this boy and they knew him. His name was Jacob Saku living in Bangeli. That was in the Regional Court and the case lasted three days, there was also a lawyer by the name of Pillay who was standing for the other boy and my son was saying \"No, it was not this boy\" and they said the sock that he had one, he knew it because it belonged to his brother and so the lawyer was trying to deny that this was my son and yet my son was saying, \"No, I know this is my brother\", so this boy was sentenced to 17 years, that is as far as I can go.",
