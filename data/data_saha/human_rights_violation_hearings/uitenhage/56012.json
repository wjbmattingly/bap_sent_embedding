            "Thank you Chairperson.  Thank you, I know he is going to abide and do as you have asked because this statement it quite long, and the story as well.  You became a struggler from 1950 and some of the people here who are Commissioners were not born yet.  I am not going to get into details.  Now, could you just briefly tell us and I can see here you were a member of the Youth League in 1950, and in 1957 you were in the forefront in the struggle, and during the Sharpeville massacre, you were also locked in for 60 days, and I think you are one of the people who have been very loyal to the struggle despite of all the nasty experiences and the arrests that were happening to you.\nUITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 D MFAZWE\n Now, our main point here today is to look at the gross violations of the Human Rights.  I can see that there are seven things that you have mentioned about your getting to Lesotho, it is not that we disregard all these, we know they form part of the story, we are now concerned about the violation of the human rights.  Now, lets look directly into this matter.  There are certain things that affected your health, towards the end of your story you have mentioned these and in 1985 during the state of emergency, you were arrested and assaulted and your eardrum was punctured and this is considered as a violation.  I want you to listen carefully and even to look at me.  Mr Mfazwe would you look at me.  \n Mr Mfazwe, this Commission is asking that you should work together with it, so if you do not cooperate, people are going to be impatient and not give you a hearing and therefore this is going to disrupt your story.  We read about your struggle for liberation and we were impressed.  Now, we would like to focus on your health that was affected.\n Something that affected your health was after the state of emergency, when your eardrum was punctured, and you were unable to hear, so therefore we want you to cooperate with us.  Look at me because when you talk, I shall be interrupting because you can't go on and on and on.\n Now, could you explain briefly, don't refer to any file please, put them aside, that is not going to help us, we have got your statement.  Say it in brief, Sir.",

There was a conflict about rent between the municipality and the rent residents.  The municipality wanted the people to pay the full rates and service charges, and the residents of Uitenhage were complaining because they felt that their houses were very old, they had started to occupy them from 1968.",

Then, I refused to join the UDF because I was a member of the ANC despite that it had been banned at the time and I was not telling the world that I was a member of the ANC at the time.\n There was a meeting that was held by the council and the UDF in a certain hall and then they disagreed because the UDF did not want the rent payers to pay the charges and they felt that these houses that they were living in, they were very old and they were complaining about their high rent that they had to pay.",

I don't want us to forget that for quite some time, the whole of yesterday and Monday we had no problem, it is only that certain people wanted to disturb all this because in whatever we do, we have got to do it with respect.  \n I would like to thank the victims support group of Uitenhage.  We would like also to extend the gratitude to them for the wonderful work that they have done.  This hearing in Uitenhage has been a success during the three weeks.  We wouldn't have been able to have done this without your support.  \n We thank all the community structures of Uitenhage, that have support to this hearing.  We thank the residents who came here in great numbers and mainly they gave us the full respect as a Commission which we can never forget, though it was disturbed towards the end by some people who are unruly.  \n We therefore wish to thank the panel, beginning with the Commissioners, Denzil Potgieter, Mapule Ramashala, who come from the Western Cape.  They have been with us in Queenstown, and I think they have been with us before that and indeed we have gotten used to being with them in hearings and we do wish to record our thanks to them, record our appreciation of the effort that they make towards assisting us in handling this hearing.  We are indeed taking you as our friends and our comrades in our work.\n We wish to thank our staff, regional manager.
