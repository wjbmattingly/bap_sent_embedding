It was a leisure place. That happened the night of the 16th June 1977.\n When we did this, the police didn't arrest us and we went home, we stayed at home and during September one of us was arrested in connection with something else and after his arrest, it became apparent that he had burnt somebody else's house at Nobuhle and then this thing of our having burnt these things also came out.",
