My husband stood up and opened the door. He took a glass lamp and set it alight and the policemen asked \"Where were the boys\", my husband said, \"I don't have boys here in this house, I only have girls\". Then the policemen asked him \"Where are those girls\". My husband said there were no boys in that home, then he took this lamp and went into the girls bedroom and there was one of my daughters by the name of Norita and this policemen beat Norita and my husband asked why they were beating our daughter.\n Then the police beat my husband and shot him in the leg and he fell down and I screamed and asked them why did they shoot him. They pointed the gun at me an I ran out of the house.\n I heard a loud shot as I was going out of the house and I was running at the time, then the policemen came out and I was hiding somewhere and when I saw that they had gone out of the house, I went back and I found my husband lying down on the floor. The intestines were exposed, then these policemen went to call the white policemen. \n I then saw these white policemen coming into the house. There were many of them, round about seven in number. \n They asked from those who were there, they asked why did you kill an elderly person. I don't know what answer they gave. Then an ambulance was called by the very policemen and whilst the others were waiting in the house with me, but the ambulance came when my husband had already died and he was taken away.\n I think I am through with my evidence.",

From morning to day we have been listening to all the stories about how policemen were just shooting widely, shooting people to death, we have been going round this country and even in this region, but I don't remember us getting so many witnesses testifying against policemen who were shooting widely at people.\n I think this is quite evident that here in Uitenhage the policemen were war unto themselves. We may perhaps get more testimony on this matter but you can see that policemen were just shooting at people as if they were shooting at animals in this area. From the evidence we have, we therefore feel that Uitenhage is outstanding in such atrocities. \n We are going to investigate as much as we can even in that court where there was this inquest and find out if they said no-one was responsible for your husbands death, when your husband was actually killed in front of you and shot at by the policemen. We would want to know from them what they meant by that.\n We would therefore thank you for your evidence as forwarded to this Commission and we are going to do our level best to get the truth of this and perhaps this could console you if you were to get the actual truth of what happened to your husband.
