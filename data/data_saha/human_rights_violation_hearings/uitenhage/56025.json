When he left in 1961, I was at  my marital home, but when he left home, he said that he was working at Industecs and he was to go in at 5:50, but he knew that he was leaving.  He left for work, took his shirt and left for work, and he did not come back home at 6 o'clock when he normally came back, he didn't come back from UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 N PLAATJIE\nwork, and my mother waited and he saw Mr Makidwana and Tebe coming and Mrs Chaka, and they said Mrs Faku, we have come to let you know, please do not worry, that your son has crossed the border, please do not tell too many people this, do not even tell your children, rather keep it under wraps, and that is how my brother left.\n One day, while I was at home in Dumbaswa because my mother had been arrested and had been put in jail for 7 years, when they were released, they were released to Dembaswa because they were told that they can not stay here in Port Elizabeth, so we had to move to Dembaswa and I was at home because my mother had been in custody at the time so my father was there.  My father then said to me, you must please turn on the radio at 12 o'clock, you are going to hear your brother singing.  At 12 o'clock that night, I switched on the radio, and tuned into the station that my father had told me about and I heard my brother singing these songs.",

My father also passed away without having any idea where this child was and at a time where the exiles were returning home, we thought we was also going to come\nUITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 N PLAATJIE\nback, and now the reason I am here today is because I see that everyone else has come back except him.",

The ANC has assured us that they will cooperate with us in every way so much so that they will give us a list of the names of the people who died while in their camps and assured us that they will help us in answering peoples questions about what happened to their loved ones and make whatever information they can available to us, so we will handle your request accordingly and try and establish what happened to your brother, and why he did not return when everyone else returned.  \n We would like to assure you of that because there are many instances that we come across in these hearings, similar to this one of yours, where it becomes evident that some people come back and others don't and that there is no explanation from the organisation that goes to the parents to explain to them what happened, so we will try by all means.
