<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON: Are you both going to swear? </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>PANEL MEMBER: What is your name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>Francina Ntopela is my name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>WENDY SIZEKA RAMATHE: (Sworn duly states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>FRANCINA NTOPELA: (Sworn duly states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>CHAIRPERSON: We welcome you ladies and we thank you that you have come to appear before this </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>Commission. We shall now hand over to Revd Xundu to lead the witness. </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a> We greet you Wendy. By the way where is your home Wendy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>MS RAMATHE:  My home is in New Brighton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  What is your clan name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>MS RAMATHE:  My clan name is Madiba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  By the way, your story states that you were working for the Department of Health and </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>Welfare here in Port Elizabeth. Could you now tell this Commission what work were you doing at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>MS RAMATHE:  I Wendy Ramathe used to work for the Department of Health and we used to look at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>welfare of the people and this was a very big job. </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a> On the 29th July 1986, I used to work with Albertina Dlanjwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Just before the 29th, could you tell us that you also used to deliver food parcels together </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>with Albertina and people used to queue up for these food parcels. These were people from Soweto, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>MS RAMATHE:  Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Now, when did it all start that you should be suspected, whereby people started to have </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>doubts about you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>MS RAMATHE:  We used to work hand in hand with the people and this suspicion that people had later on, </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>became a surprise to us. We used to look into the needs of the people. Then on the 29th July, I got a </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>telephone call from Albertina's husband, telling me that Mrs Dlanjwa was not well and he was asking me to </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>accompany her to see a doctor in Corsten.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a> At 3.30 after my rounds I then went to Mrs Dlanjwa's house and there were visitors from Transkei </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>and some other people who had problems, because that is what they used to do, since we did not have an </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>office of our own. People used to come to us and then we would look into their needs and their problems and </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>give what is appropriate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a> Firstly, in that Zwide area, we saw that there was suffering and a lot of facilities were lacking, there </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>were no creches, this was not the first project. There used to be a house owned by the Municipality in </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>Siyongwana, so we investigated and looked at this house to be used as a creche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a> In 1982 we got it and some children were kept there and it was named Ntlalontle, because it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>expressing that we wanted good health for our people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a> People from the locality worked there. Then again, we could see that some people were sending </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>children to this creche when they were actually doing nothing. We decided to keep these elderly people busy. </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>So as to curb their suffering we taught them wonderbox, we taught them how to knit socks and even the </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>young women who were unemployed, we decided to keep them occupied by teaching them handwork.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  I remember that you had a remarkable work, which was well known to most people at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>MS RAMATHE:  Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  I am listening to your story. I now want you to tell us about this particular incident of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>day which gave you a great shock, because there had been no indication that people were not in favour of </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>this? I still remember even the "roldebuck" that used to be sold there. So, you found people throwing petrol </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>bombs at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>MS RAMATHE:  On the 29th, a young boy of about 15 years came into my house and I was from work. In </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>front, I was with Mrs Dlanjwa who was talking on the telephone and there were two elderly women next to </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>the door. </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a> This boy passed and I saw him cutting and disconnecting the phone and I was shocked. He was </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>dressed in a Khaki shorts and I saw him taking out something that he hit on the floor and I could see it was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>petrol bomb. Thereafter there was fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a> My first reaction was to jump for these old people who were sitting next to the door and Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>Dlanjwa also helped me. There were people in the bedroom, here in Mrs Dlanjwa's house. They screamed, </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>called out "Wendy, your head is on fire", and then I tried to put off the fire. We ran towards the kitchen and </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>this boy again exploded another petrol bomb and there was a big flame in front and at the back and there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>no way out. The doors were locked with burglar proofs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Do you think the neighbours were responsible for this or do you think that this was </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>politically motivated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>MS RAMATHE: What I think is that there is some political influence in all this because, a little bit after that, </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>at the time we were burning, there was one child who pulled the burglar door and we saw a hippo parked </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>outside as we were jumping out through the window.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  What was this hippo doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>MS RAMATHE:  There were some white men standing next to the hippo, they were just watching. They </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>were not doing anything because as I was going out I could see they were just standing and doing nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  You say, in that house there used to be mealie meal and so on. Did the people do any </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>looting on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>MS RAMATHE:  The one sitting next to me is the one who had a chance to see everything because I just </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>went out and ran out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Did you identify any of these people who attacked your home? Is she the one who is </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>going to answer, if so, then give her a chance. </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a> Mama, tell us how are you connected to this story, just tell us, were you just an eye witness or do </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>you have a lot of information as you were the person who was helping Mrs Dlanjwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>MS NTOPELA:  Mrs Nontsikelelo Dlanjwa is my sister. She comes after me. When I left my house, she was </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>booked off by the doctor because of high blood pressure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a> I did my washing and I decided to go and help her. When I got there, I found Mrs Myila who is our </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>sister-in-law together with her son. My sister was sleeping in the bedroom and they were all in one bedroom. </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>I helped with whatever, preparing food. In front there was an office and there were two women there in that </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>office. Mrs Wendy who used to work with my sister came. At the time there was this telephone call from my </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>niece, I thought it was for me, but Mrs Ramethe Wendy said, "No, the telephone call was for Mrs Dlanjwa" </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>who went out of the bedroom to receive the telephone call.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a> I then decided to go and take the washing from outside with the intention to prepare supper. For a </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>short while, I just went out and I looked round and I saw some smoke and this house was facing some </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>shacks. I thought the smoke was from the shacks and I saw more and more smoke coming out of one of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>windows from my sister's house. I then turned, when I was getting into the yard, my sister was in flames and </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>she was wrapped in an apron and I heard her crying "why are you burning me, why don't you tell me when </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>you are dissatisfied".</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a> When I got into the yard, I saw some young boys. Billy was one of them, Mongezi of Mgengo was </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>another one.  Matega from Mgengo was another one, Temba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a> All these children, Temba came from Fumba and Maboetie was one of them. They were of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>same family, the Gondwana family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Are these children still there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>MS NTOPELA:  They were masked and they were coming out of my sister's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Do you still see them? After that incident, do you see them now or you last saw them </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>MS NTOPELA:   They are there, they were there, I remember that after that incident, there was a story that </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>Albertina was stealing some clothes and sending them to Transkei and this was dismissed by the comrades </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>and there was no press report on this. These children said they were members of the UDF and when this </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>happened, some elderly guys came to my house, but I just can't recall their names. </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a> They told me that Mrs Dlanjwa used to work with them as a member of the UDF and these children </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>who had done this had been sent and bought to do all this. They said UDF was not responsible for this act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  If you can recall, in that statement of Mkuseli Jack, he tried to distance the UDF and said </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>this was just a criminal act that they cannot promote. Do you still remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>MS NTOPELA:  Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  After this, was there any way of getting hold of these people who were responsible for </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>this act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>MS NTOPELA:  Firstly, I must say at the there was this fire, the hippo's came immediately as if they had </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>been nearby expecting this act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a> They used a hosepipe to extinguish the fire and it was supposed to be a person to take guard of that </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>house according to the government police. But what these soldiers did was that they just drove out and left </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>no-one in guard. A certain detective was sent there and he claimed that he did not want to associate himself </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>with that because he had just come from Port Elizabeth and he had to investigate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Was there a court case after this act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>MS NTOPELA:  They were collected, these children, and then when we sent another one to go and check </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>whether they had collected the right people, then this boy who we had sent said he got scared because these </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>children were changing in appearance, so he got scared and he did not bring any definite information to us </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>and it just ended there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>CHAIRPERSON: Sizeka we are going to hand over to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Was there any investigation or any case on this act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>MS RAMATHE:  I was called to the New Brighton Court where I was asked to identify these people. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>couldn't, except that I could identify that Mongezi who had come on that day and unfortunately he was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>there in court on the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a> After that I was not happy, that was after I had been discharged from hospital, because at that time I </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>was in hospital, people kept on threatening me and when this one died, they said I would be the next.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Now, these people were just threatening you. Even of Mkuseli Jack had made that </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>statement to distance the UDF from this act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>MS RAMATHE:  Yes, that was the time that I was not happy, even in my house, I didn't leave my house by </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>choice, I was compelled to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  So, there was no court case of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>MS RAMATHE:  There was, because I say I did go to the New Brighton Court but nothing happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  What are your wishes as you have come before this Commission. What would you like </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>this Commission to do about this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>MS RAMATHE:  Before I could state my wish, I would like to expantiate and say, in all the work that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>used to do with Mrs Dlanjwa, we were working mainly with some white people like Molly Blackburn. I still </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>recall a certain incident where there were floods in Veeplass. We were working with them and there are so </p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>many things that they used to help us with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a> They would even lead us and show us the correct channels to follow whenever there was any </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Just on that point, now do you think this is what made these people to have this </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>suspicions. Do you think that there was a third force that influenced the youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>MS RAMATHE:  Yes, I think there was a third force because I remember one other day in Veeplaas as we </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>were standing, we were taking food all over the place. We were standing there with Molly Blackburn and </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>Mrs Dlanjwa was there too and we were working. Mrs Molly said, there were some whites who said "are we </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>working with this Molly Blackburn" and there were some nasty remarks that were making us unhappy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  So, your suspicion is that these youth were being supported by some police from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>government as if what you were doing was not favoured by the comrades. Is that your suspicion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>MS RAMATHE:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  That was the last time you worked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>MS RAMATHE:  At the time this happened my husband had been retrenched and I was the breadwinner </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>because my children were very young at the time. In July 1986, I then got injured and then there was no way </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>of survival for my family and then we decided to leave Port Elizabeth for King Williamstown to go and stay </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>with my parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a> It was very tough during these years. From 1986 to this year and it is only just a few months that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>have just got a job at one creche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Did you get any pension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>MS RAMATHE:  Yes, I got 5% pension from work. I had many burns on my head. I have got no ear </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>because it got burnt and when I am sitting, I have got to support myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  What did they say at your work? </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>MS RAMATHE:  They just decided to book me off and they didn't give me any substantial amount. All they </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>gave me was R7000 for burning and I had to live on this amount for several years because my husband was </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>unemployed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Then what happened to your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>MS RAMATHE:  When they moved from Mrs Dlanjwa's house, they moved onto my house. They looted </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>everything, my furniture, they took everything that they wanted to from my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Was it general looting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>MS RAMATHE:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  The policemen too, did not investigate on this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>MS RAMATHE:  No. My father who was there tried to stop them, but to no avail. So the people said we </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>were working with the system and I just couldn't tell how. It was just something to deflate us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  You said you have now, you would like to state your wishes. What would you like this </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>MS RAMATHE:  My wish is that you should investigate who the instigators of this act were. I need my </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>furniture and everything of mine, because in 1991 my husband was threatened that he should not come back </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>from exile clever and demanding his things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a> I am always nervous, I am afraid of crowds. I am not trusting because I can't take it that I used to </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>work in close connection with the community, but today I find that I am now an enemy to my enemy. </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>Wherever I am, I feel untrusted and I also don't trust.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>REVD. XUNDU:  Thank you lady. I still remember this period and I know how you feel. I am now going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>hand over to other Commissioners who may have some questions to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>CHAIRPERSON: Mrs Wendy Ramethe we wish to thank you for coming before this Commission to tell us </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>this pathetic story. We remember the time when this incident occurred. We people who come from afar, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>thought that when there was word that this incident was not connected with the political organisations, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>thought that it would be the end of everything and what would be left would only be the accident you met </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>together with Mrs Dlanjwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a> It is very painful now to hear after the incident, you still became unhappy and you were harassed to </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>an extent that you had to live a lonely life in your community. This causes much pain to us. </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a> There is one thing that we have always said here that we should ask the policemen and soldiers </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>whose names are mentioned frequently as perpetrators, that they should come forward before this </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>Commission. We therefore would like to make another plea to these young men you have mentioned here, </p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>who are three in number, that they should come forward</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>forward. Their names are Mongezi (surname unknown), Themba Ngodwane is one of them and Billy Pemba </p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>to come and explain what exactly happened, to this Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a> The Human Rights Violation are not only done by policemen and soldiers or whites, they are just </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>human rights violation whether they are done by people who call themselves comrades, so we therefore </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>make this loud call to these three people who have been mentioned that they should come before this </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>Commission whilst time permits. To come and tell us what exactly happened. </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a> We know that this will not give back your true health, you have been damaged and you will enjoy </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>ill-health until you die, but we still want to know the exact truth of what actually happened and also to know </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>who was the perpetrator and also if they did this on political motivation they should state why they did it and </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>who had sent them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a> We would also like to extend our sympathy to you and all the things that you have asked from us, </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>we shall look into them and as I said to you earlier, there is one thing that we cannot restore to you and that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>your good health. Thank you.</p>
