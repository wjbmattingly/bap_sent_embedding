<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will therefore ask Michael Tule to come forward as a witness,  we thank you for your presence.  You are going to be lead by Ms Maya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MICHAEL TULE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Tule, you said in your statement that you saw a policeman by the name of Fouche standing on top of the hippo and he had a red flag and when he dropped it, the shooting started and that is when you were shot.  Could you briefly explain to us what actually happened to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR TULE:</span> In 1985, on the 21 March, I went to a funeral in Kwanobuhle, but when I got to no.16, and lifted my head, I saw Whites in hippos and police vans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Without interrupting, like we've been doing, you can just mention how you got injured.  That is at the time of the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR TULE:</span> The Whites shot me on my head and I fell down, and I was unconscious and when I regained consciousness it was after 2 weeks and I was in Livingstone Hospital.  I asked one nurse why was I there, they had tied my hands and feet,</p>

<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>2 M TULE</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>and they said I had been running mad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR TULE:</span> It was the nurse that told me that I was running mad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How long were you in hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR TULE:</span> I was there for 3 days after 3 weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> And then what happened when you were discharged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR TULE:</span> When I was in hospital, I was trained to walk and then some White men who I did not know, came and they said they wanted me.  We should go.  Then I did not ask them where to.  Then they took me and put me into a police van and drove me to Church Street, here in Uitenhage and they locked me up.  I was there for 3 days and a certain man, unknown to me, came and he said he was a lawyer so he said he had come to fetch me and that is how I was discharged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> After that, when people were called to Jubilee Hotel, were you not one of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR TULE:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was there any amount you received from the government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR TULE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> And after they shot you on the head, did you lead a normal life and work the way you used to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR TULE:</span> No, I was very hurt because now I would have some blackouts which started after 1985, even today I am still taking some treatment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Surely you must be having a request to this Commission.  How can you be helped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR TULE:</span> My first request is that those Whites that shot there, now, I would like this Commission to investigate about these perpetrators, these White perpetrators, who are</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>3 M TULE</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>they.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a> Secondly, I do go to the clinic to get treatment, but from 1985 they have been giving me the same type of pills, and I don't get cured, so if this Commission could organise that I should see another doctor I would be happy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a> The third request is, I wish that they could erect a monument right here in front of this City Hall because I see a monument of some unknown person to me, so I would like that they should erect a monument here in front of this City Hall, in memory of the incident.  Again I ask this Commission, that this hall is not used by Whites only and not Blacks and so I am asking that in future, the Blacks will be allowed to use this hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> I would like to make a request.  I know that all these things that are mentioned by this witness they are supported by the residents of this place, but we have got a limited time because we have intentions to go to the scene where this incident occurred so as you keep on clapping and taking time to stop, that is eating up the time.  I am really pleading you, I am not stopping you from clapping, because I know it is the way you are showing the support to the witnesses as a community, but I am asking that you just clap for a very short time and then stop.  You agree to that, yes, thank you. We thank you Mr Tule.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Tule.</p>
