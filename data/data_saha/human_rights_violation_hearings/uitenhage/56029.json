(inaudible)  call that near the location. I was at the stop street there waiting for a bus to go home and I think it was about the 18th April, it was on a Thursday, in 1985.\n While standing there waiting for a bus, a lorry appeared from the direction of Uitenhage, having loaded branches and when they got to the training school, where they learnt to shoot, it stopped on the tar road near the gate and things were bad at the time. \n This lorry stopped and a hippo appeared from the direction of the location and entered into the training camp where they learned to shoot and stopped near a big tree. I don't know what kind of tree it was. It was obvious that they were going to do something in the location, because the lorry parked behind the tree.\n Two policemen alighted from the hippo, the others remained in the hippo and they got under the branches in this truck and I realised that these boys are up to something.

You must remember it cost me 30c to get home, but I paid somebody R2 to take me home, to save our children from the lions. Fair enough, God had sent a car that took me, but this man spoke with a Zulu accent and took me home and I was limping, but I ran to tell our children that they must watch out for this Blue Municipality lorry with branches over, and they mustn't dare go near that truck.\n I ran past No. 6 and No. 5 to my house at No. 4, and I put my bag on the table and as I walked out, the shots rang out and they started shooting.\n The Boers shot.

            "Sir, we thank you, you too Peter or Lulamile for the story that you have come and shared with us as the Commission and as my colleagues said, my two colleagues from Cape Town have stated, this incident is very similar to one that took place in Cape Town known as the \"Trojan Horse Killing\".\n They were fortunate in the sense that their story was covered by the media, but yours, I cannot recall at any stage that your story received any publicity to expose the dirty tricks of the police. This always happens that in bigger town, such as they one where they come from. These things are newsworthy, but when it happens in smaller places they are not, they are not worthy of making news.\n We are going to try our best as the Commission to follow up on your story and the questions that I have put to you which made it seem as if you were in a court of law, putting you under cross-examination are so that we can follow up on your story.\n It is important for us to know what happened because the police were known - they are supposed to know which policemen were driving that truck that day and the Municipality should have records of who was driving the truck. The people in charge of the Municipality at the time and the police at the time if they had done their jobs correctly should know who went out in that truck that day, so they should have records of that shooting incident and we as the Commission will investigate this because of the four children that were killed and also because of the injury of you sir.\n We will investigate and try and establish the truth so that you can come to terms with it. We thank you and promise that if there is anything else, any other information that we need, that we will get back to you. Thank you very much.",
