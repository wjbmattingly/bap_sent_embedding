<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We are at this point in time, going to ask Xolani Maxin Mzinzi to come closer and to be lead by Ms Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">XOLANI MAXIM MZINZI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> Thank you, I greet you Xolani and you are also going to give some explanation connected to this incident which is a full picture of what happened in Langa in Cape Town in Sharpeville and even here in Uitenhage.  We therefore welcome you before this Commission.  Just before you say anything, I would like to highlight something that you have written here on your statement that the questions we had about the banning order you have referred that when you got to the square you had got some pamphlets that were explaining about the second banning order which stated that the funeral that was supposed to be conducted on that Thursday had been banned.  Now could you explain to us what these pamphlets looked like, and who were the writers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> Yes I picked it up.  It was just a paper and there was no name written of the writer.  It was just something, no address.</p>

<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>2 X MZINZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> Was there no letterhead to show that it came from the government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> No, it had nothing that indicated that it was from the South African Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> Here you explained how you got shot, now could you tell us further when you got shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> I was shot at the same time with the other people.  We were just approaching section 16.  I was in the third row in that procession and what actually happened I saw Kwanele at the time he was falling and then when I was turning to run away I also saw myself falling down.  Whilst I was lying down there on my face, I was lifted up by a policeman that was speaking Zulu and he pointed a gun at me asking whether I wanted him to shoot me dead.  Then I did not answer back.  Fortunately an ambulance came and took me to hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> So this policeman that spoke Zulu was it one of those that were called the Amma Chaka, named after the King of the Zulu's Chaka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> Yes, I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> Then, when they took you to Livingstone hospital and you were discharged, you were taken to jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> For how long were you in jail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> I was in jail for 4 days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> What was the reason they gave for locking you up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> They said they were arresting me for public violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> Was it in connection with the stones</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>3 X MZINZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>that they had placed on the peoples hands at the time you were in pain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> So, as they were shooting you they wanted to give an impression that you are the people who caused the trouble?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> Now, what are your requests to this Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> My request is that ever since I got injured, I became an epileptic.  Just once in three months and when it happens it seems like a stroke because after 3 days, after the attack, I wont be able to eat, I wont be able to do anything.  Then this is an indication that I cannot be employed.  The doctor said that I was nervous, and I could not go on with my education, so I went as far as Matric.  I can not go on with my education, so I am asking this Commission to consider this problem of mine because there is no place were I can be employed.  I have tried to get work for myself, but I am unemployable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> By the way, where were you hit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> I was hit by the bullet at the back of my head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> Did they take it out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> No, it just hit me and chipped, so it did not get into my head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> But it caused you to get into hospital and you were semi-conscious?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> Is there any other information or any other requests you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZINZI:</span> Yes, I am asking that there should be a centre</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>4 X MZINZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>that should be erected because some of us could not further our education and we cannot be employed, so if we could have a centre where they are going to teach us some hand work so as to have some skill, we would be grateful.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO-MADIKIZELA:</span> Thank you Mr Mzinzi.</p>
