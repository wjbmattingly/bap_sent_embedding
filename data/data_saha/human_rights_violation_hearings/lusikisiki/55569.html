<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAKWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Let us begin with your father's story.  You said that he was arrested.  For how long was he arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAKWA:</span> As I was still young at the time I am not sure about this, but I can just estimate that it was plus minus one year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How old were you at the time of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAKWA:</span> I was about seven years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Your father, was he a member of Congo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAKWA:</span> Yes I can say so, although I cannot be sure, but because he was arrested at the time when Congo members were arrested, I can say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How was his health at the time of his release?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAKWA:</span> He was very sick and as I was young at the time I saw him being beaten up by the boers, because they would kick him and would beat him with the back of their rifles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You mean that on this day that he was arrested, you were there, and you saw them beating him up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAKWA:</span> Yes, I saw all this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How did you feel when you saw your father being beaten up in front of you as you were still a child and he was your father.</p>

<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAKWA:</span> Yes, because since then he was not well and he could even go back to work to work for us, because I could not even go to school, because he wanted me to go to school, but he could not go back to work to work for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Do you have a request you want to make to this Commission?</p>

I just heard that my uncle was also arrested, as they were arresting anybody in the village.   I saw him when he came back from jail.  I</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>do not know where they arrested him, but he just told us that he was arrested.</p>
