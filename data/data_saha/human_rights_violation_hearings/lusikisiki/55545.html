<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anybody from yesterday who has not testified yet? What is your name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR NUBA:</span> Jongindlu Theophilus Nuba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your name is here Sir, from yesterday's list.  Please come onto the stage. Is there somebody else from yesterday? We will have to wait for a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MPHELANQU CHUSHELWA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mphelanqu Cheba you have heard yesterday's evidence.   Is there something that you would like to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHUSHELWA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  I would like to add, but before I add to the evidence, yesterday's evidence was the truth indeed but in Pondoland the root of the whole problem....</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a> From 1959 Pondo people became violent because of what I am going to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a> The first court was in Nonqulana.  This is where the Pondo people met for the first time to arise against the Government of the day.   This place was called Nonqulana. It is the name of the mountain.  This is why people said the Pondo people are gathering at Nonqulana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a> The second mountain was Ndlovu, the third Ngquza.   The root of this problem started at Nonqulana.  My</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>wish is that that mountain, Nonqulana should be commemorated one way or another.  There should be some form of a tombstone perhaps because everything started at Nonqulana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> Look, the white man has Vasco da Gama, Jan van Riebeeck.   The black man was not educated and enlightened about their history.   This is why I say this mountain, there must be a monument there.   This is what I would like to add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you for enlightening us.  This is what</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>we want.   As you have listened to the evidence, if </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>there is something that is not clarified you have clarified it for us.   Thank you Sir for such wisdom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> I thought that Ngquza was also referred to as Nonqulana.  Now you have clarified things for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a> Thank you.</p>
