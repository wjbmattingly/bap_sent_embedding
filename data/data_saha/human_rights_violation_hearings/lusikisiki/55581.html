<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Will you briefly tell us what happened to your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS PIKA:</span> The boers came, took him, beat him up, kicked him, threw him on the floor.   They threw him into a police van and took him to town.   He was detained for two days in town and then he came back.  He was terribly injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Exactly how was he injured?</p>

<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> According to your statement Mrs Pika you say that they used the back of the gun to beat him up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS PIKA:</span> You say that they were using guns, they would kick him with their boots, slap him on the face, throw him on the floor.  That ill-treatment caused his illness.</p>

<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You speak about a child with epileptic fits.  Whose child is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS PIKA:</span> It is my child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Do you remember what you said about this child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS PIKA:</span> I remember you spoke about this child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Could you repeat please.  What did you say about the child.
