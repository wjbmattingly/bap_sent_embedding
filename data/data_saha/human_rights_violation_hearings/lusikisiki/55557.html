<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>Fanele Lungu?    Nofuduka Eleanor Mamjoli Xhakana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">FANELE LUNGU:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I would request you to put on your microphones because you are going to be asked questions in English.  We will start with Mr Lungu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a> Mr Lungu can you hear me?  You are here today to talk about your wife and about yourself.  You are from Izekelo Bizana.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And your family life was very sadly effected by your detention and that of your wife, Emily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Now you were arrested twice.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> Yes, I was arrested twice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> The first time you were arrested from your  house.  Is that correct?  In Bizana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And then in 1961 you were detained again for another three months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> This affected you badly, physically it affected you.  Can you explain to me what the effects were?  What happened to you as a result of that time in detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> Can you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> You were physically injured while you were in detention.   What were the results of those injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> It was very cold in the cells at that time.  I was affected by that cold and my ear was also affected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And I believe your eye was also affected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> Yes, I am blind in my one eye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Your wife was arrested.  For what reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> She was arrested because she was a member of Congo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And what happened to her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> She was pregnant and she lost the baby, that was when they released her.  That baby died inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> So she was released straight after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a> Mr Lungu you asked the Commission for assistance.  Would you like to tell what it is you are requesting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> Anything the Commission will do for me, is fine with me.  There is nothing specific I would like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Is there anything else you wish to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> No thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Mr Lungu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Lungu, I find out that you were detained and you were ill-treated while in detention and after that your wife was also detained and she was pregnant and she lost the baby.  After that she died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a> I want to know, when you made the statement to the Commission, did you make only one statement or two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>Because you have to make your statement because you were tortured while in detention and you have to make a second statement concerning the arrest of your wife and the death of the baby and the death of your wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a> If you have made one statement I would like you to make another statement concerning your wife, because these are two different matters.  We cannot combine them in one statement.  Can you understand me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUNGU:</span> I made two statements and I stated in my statement that I was detained twice and I also mentioned that my wife was released because she lost the baby.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a> At the time of her release I was still in jail and the police came to tell me about this.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a> I did make two statements.   </p>
