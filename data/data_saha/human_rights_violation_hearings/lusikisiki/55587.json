And the organisation requested to hold a meeting in my home because it was raining and there was no place where they can gather.\nI agreed and Simo Dlamini came and he said that he met a lady, Khethiwe, who is a sister to Chief Bukrula and he heard a message that I am not supposed to allow ANC \nmeetings in my home.   And he told me that I would get what was coming to me.\n And one day, late afternoon, I heard a dog barking outside and I went out to look what was going on and the dog stopped barking.\n After a while I heard gunshots and I ran back to my house and I told my children to come inside because there were gunshots outside.\n I think at about nine o'clock I heard children crying and we saw that the house was burning.  We went out to look what was happening and while the house was in flames and we could not go in and we watched this hut while it was burning.\n After this I sent a message to the Chief to report this matter and the Chief came and there were arguments between the members of the ANC and the Chief.   And the members of the ANC were trying to find out what happened in one of my huts.   And I was told to go to town to report this matter to the police.\n The police took my statement.  They asked me where the Chief was.  I told them that he was in my hut but that he left.   They told me to come back the following day with the Chief so that he can sign the statement.\n We went there at nine and they told me the Chief was not there and he had already left.  I asked them what to do.  They told me to go to one office.  They told me to go and investigate and find out who burned down my house and bring this person to the police so that they can arrest this person.\n Chief Nonkonyane came to our village.  He told us that he will not allow our organisation to continue in our village.   We were too scared at the time.\n That is all I know.",
