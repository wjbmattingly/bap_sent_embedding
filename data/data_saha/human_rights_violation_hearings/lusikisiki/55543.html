<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">THEOPHILUS NDLOVU BONGOZA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Can you hear me Mr Bongoza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR BONGOZA:</span> Yes I can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Now you are here today to talk about yourself.  You were arrested by the police.  What was the charge for that arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR BONGOZA:</span> I was arrested because I was a member of Congo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> In your statement it says that there was a person by the name of Dyasi and his house that was burnt.  Was there any connection to your arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR BONGOZA:</span> Yes, that name was mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> When you were arrested for the second time, you were taken to Umzimkhulu and there you had interrogation for five months.  During that time what was your experience?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR BONGOZA:</span> When I was first arrested they brought me to Lusikisiki and I was arrested alone.   And then they transferred me Umzimkhulu for five months.  I was not ill-treated in Umzimkhulu because when I arrived there I was praying, I was singing church songs.   And the police, because I was behaving well they did not ill-treat me, but the food was bad.   We used to eat beans which were not healthy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you for that testimony.   In your requests to the Commission you make a statement about</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>Nquzo mountain and your concern for that mountain.   Will you explain what your concern is please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR BONGOZA:</span> About the Nquzo mountain, the people who died there and who were buried there and the way they died.   When I look at that mountain I can see that it is not well looked after.   I would like the Commission to build a police station there so that mountain can be looked after.   If the Commission would help to build a police station in that place I would be glad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mr Bongoza there have been people who have asked for a memorial to be put there.  Would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR BONGOZA:</span> Yes I would agree with that, but that will not  help much.   That is why I am asking for the Commission to build a police station there, so that the police would look after that place.   If there will be a monument there, it will not have good meaning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mr Bongoza, one last question, I want to take you back a little bit to Kokstad when you were on trial.   You were represented by Mr Swart.  Where is he now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR BONGOZA:</span> I do not know where Mr Swart is because since I was released I never contacted him, because when I was released I told myself that I will not agree with the Government and I was scared of the Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR BONGOZA:</span> Thank you Mr Bongoza.  Is there anything else you wish to say to the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR BONGOZA:</span> Yes I have another request to the Commission that I sold most of my cattle to pay for Mr Swart.  I would like the Commission to build a church in my area because it was only God who helped me to be released.  I would like the Commission to build a church.  That is my request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Mr Bongoza.</p>
