<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">DALIWE MGULWA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mr Mgulwa you are also going to talk about the execution of a member of your family.  Who are you going to talk about exactly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGULWA:</span> My father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Can you briefly tell us when he was executed and what the cause was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGULWA:</span> They were arrested after Khongolose. They were then detained in Kokstad.  Then taken to Pietermaritzburg.  From there apparently they were taken to Pretoria.  After that we could not get into touch with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a> When my father was arrested I was 17 years of age.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is there someone at home who would visit him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGULWA:</span> My mother was still alive. She would visit him.  My grandfather as well.  They have both passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>They were there even in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> According to your memory you say that your father was executed in 1962.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGULWA:</span> He was detained in 1960.  Then in 1961 he was in jail.  Then in 1962 he was executed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was he a member of Congo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGULWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was he affected when there was conflict between members of Congo and chiefs in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGULWA:</span> Yes because the Chief wanted to do whatever he pleased with the people.   He did not agree with that.   Then there were killings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Who said, he is ruling over these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGULWA:</span> The Chief.  He did not want Congo to exist in the area.   He did not want the struggle for liberation.  He brought them down, all the leaders of Congo.  About one hundred of them were detained.  Ninety four came back and six never came back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a> The ninety four people were freed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When you gave the statement to the statement takers of the Truth Commission you put forward requests.  Do you remember these requests?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGULWA:</span> Yes.   So that I could have peace in my heart, if my father could be exhumed and be buried back home.   Also the children, three are still at school.  If the Government could help me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You also said that amongst your requests the Commission should perhaps do something about the water supplies in the area and also if something could be done about the roads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a> Would you like to add something to that request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGULWA:</span> No.  My requests are such as you have mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is there a problem in the community with water supply?   Clean water supply and also roads that are conducive to travelling?   Is that a general problem in your village?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGULWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that all Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGULWA:</span> Yes I have finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.</p>
