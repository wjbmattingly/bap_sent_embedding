They were, the police and soldiers were in their cars which were known as caspers with their helmets, there was a helicopter surrounding us and at that time I did not know what was going on until I saw the soldiers in their jeep.\n They came to me, they said come.  I was confused because at that time I didn't like White people although I was not politically motivated, but I did not like White people.\n When I tried to answer them, I answered in Xhoza, they couldn't understand me, because they were speaking Afrikaans only.  They told me to come.  I tried to answer them in English, still they did not understand me.  They just showed me to go to that van.\n I refused, they came to me, they dragged me.

I think about half past eight at night, I arrived at Mntumeni.  I was working in Mntumeni in the railway station and on one Saturday I was off, I saw one Boer with a big stomach.\n He said to me there are people looking for you.  I went down, when I got down, they just dragged me.  They put me in the car, they drove to Bizana.  We arrived in Bizana at about half past two or three.\n They asked, they said that I killed Stanford, I killed Chief Dumile, I was distributing pamphlets from the Congress and from Lutule and they told me that I delivered a paper to Mr Makathali and to Mr Sobati and to Changhela.\n They said that one of the papers was written in English, the other one in Latin.  They put me in a hall as big as this one and they put a sail on top.  I told them I didn't know any of the accusations.  \n I am not educated, I don't know how to write.  I did not even know whether there were school at the time.  \n They phoned a lawyer the following day and the lawyer arrived and the lawyer said that this person is working and he is not arrested.  He brought me meat and sweets and Ariston came, who was a lawyer, at attorney for the Congress.\n They brought me to Durban and they told me not to go back to Bizana for ten years.",

Even the one mentioned about the 25th and I - my brother here next to me, he will be the one responsible for that invitation because he is the one who likes to visit this place around Lusikisiki and Bizana.\n We thank you for your requests concerning the Technical College.  As you are the last group to give evidence, I would like to thank you for tolerating us and I would like to thank the Government, Provincial Governments, especially the Department of Public Works that we worked in.\n We thank the Police who helped us a great deal in keeping order and as we had a problem with the generator, they endeavoured to help us, we thank the Police.\n We thank the authorities in the Police Force.  We thank our interpreters who interpreted Xhoza, English, Sotho, thank you.\n We thank the technicians, Mr Brummer, the Deputy Manager with the patience they displayed for the difficult three days, they tolerated us.  We hope to see the Deputy again in the next year.\n The visitor from Canada who stayed with us throughout these three days and has very consistently attended all our sessions.  I don't know whether she is going to stay here long, but if she has to leave back for her home in Canada, we wish to thank her for attending our hearings and wish her bon voyage to Canada.\n Lastly I wish to thank our staff, Mr Ngubo who is acting in this hearing as the person in charge and all the\nother members of staff for the patience they have displayed in a very different hearing.\n Of all the hearings that we have had, the hearing of Lusikisiki has been unique, very different from the others.\n We were faced with different problems, which we have never anticipated.  I don't think we should be discouraged by those problems, indeed I am delighted that we met them because they actually bring us close to realising how rural life impacts on people.\n We have been having hearings in the cities, even the Cradock which we called a rural hearing was in a city, it is the first time that we have come into close contact with the living conditions of the majority of our people.\n And indeed over the last three days, from the breakdown in electricity to the breakdown of the generator, to the rain, to all the inconvenience, it has been an unique experience which places us where we belong, to the feelings of the people of this country.\n We wish to thank in particular the statement takers, (indistinct) region, they have done outstanding work.  Qasi Nofomane in these three days, he experienced, they have had to endure that experience for a very long time and indeed they have gathered very interesting cases for us which we have listened to.\n Every hearing here in Lusikisiki has been an unique hearing and indeed in my judgement one of the best experiences that we can have which puts us into touch with the rural struggles.\n People who worked in remote areas, who had little support, little resources, how much they contributed to the struggle for liberation.  We pay tribute to the Pondo people\nfor enduring the hard work we have gone through.  \n Indeed they are one of the best things a person can have.  I declare the hearing of Lusikisiki now closed.",
