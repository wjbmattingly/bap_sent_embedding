I felt bad when Ndlovu and Ngquza mountains were put before Nonqulana, because everything started at Nonqulana when the comrades were standing up against the tyrannical reign of the Government of the day.   The heroes of Pondoland went to meet at Nonqulana, standing up against an autocratic rule.\n The root was Ngquza.  This is why I wanted to emphasise that history begins at Nonqulana.  This is how it can be complete.\n Thank you.",

The witnesses that came before us from yesterday to today, our efforts perhaps are something that is life to you but to us it is a part of history.\n In our historical documentation this incident is only reported, but now that we are here we realise how much it contributed to the political struggle.\n I thank you on behalf of the Commission.",
