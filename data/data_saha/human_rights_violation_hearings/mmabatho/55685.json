            "I want to tell you the story that happened on the 19th of October.  It was at night while we were still\nMMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n2 M G YAKWE\nasleep.  It was on a Thursday night.   While sleeping, it \nwas between half past two and three o'clock we heard noises and whistles outside.  When they approached we heard them saying, George cannot just die like that.   George is his uncle and he wanted to woke Joseph.  He wanted him to be up.\n When I heard my children's names I said to my husband, did you hear that, they are saying Joseph cannot just die like that.   And then we peeped through the window.  I first woke up and when I peeped through the window I said, no, this is something terrible.  And I quickly withdrew because I was scared.\n The police Hippos and everything was parked outside.  Now, I have to tell you the truth.  Joseph's death was caused by this whole thing, about his uncle, because when it was light we asked Mr Thebe and them what happened and then we were told that he had been assaulted. \n Mr Thebe gave us the whole story, because they were together.  And then we asked him.   Now the death of my grandson was  caused by the assault.  I cannot say anything about the shot that went off.  I can't say who shot him.   \n When it was light we went to the hospital.  I asked Mr Galeng to take me to the hospital, because I wanted to see - because he was going to be sent to Kimberley.   We only met the ambulance on the road.  There wasn't a way they could stop the ambulance.  And they opened and I could see him.  He was so swollen.  He was full of blood.\n And then we went back home.  While still at home the police came in large numbers, heavily built policemen.  You know, you were supposed to be scared of them, yes.   \nHis little sister came home, you know they were running - scared of this sound.  And she came and she said to me, do MMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n3 M G YAKWE\nyou know that Joseph had been shot?   Because I was still troubled with what I have seen with his uncle I was troubled I said I was now finished, this was going to kill me.  \n Mr Galeng took me the hospital again, because we had to see the one that had been shot now.   After telling us the news he told us that he had been taken away and he was now at the hospital.   Then we went to the hospital to see him.   On our arrival I was together with his aunt here, and Madidoko said that there is no help that we could offer him.   Now the next morning while he was still at the mortuary we found that the police were also there.  When we opened the door they pushed themselves into the house and he said, do you have petrol bombs in this house?  I was worried, and said which petrol bombs.  The one next to me, our next door neighbour answered them,  they said don't you have petrol bombs because they belong to you.  You know we saw daylight, so many things were thrown.  They have been throwing these teargas to us throughout.  They didn't have any mercy.    We were faced with two corpses but because God is so great he helped us that his uncle could raise.  \n We went to the charge office.  Those children was sleeping together and other corpses of his friends had his tongue protruding outside.   He was so grey in colour.  He was handcuffed like jailbirds and that made us very sick.\nI don't have any other evidence than what I have said.",
