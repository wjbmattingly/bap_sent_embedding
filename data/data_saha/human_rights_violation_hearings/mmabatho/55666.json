If there are, please if you can go through that entrance at any time during the day of over the next three days.   Statement takers are present and will be able to take your statements today and over the next two days.\n Mrs Mabalane welcome, can you hear me?   I know you have come a long way, all the way from Vryburg and I would like to again extend a warm welcome to you.  You have come to tell us today about the very painful story that you held with you for the last ten years.  It is concerning your daughter.  \n I understand that you have brought some witnesses with you.  Are they here this morning?  Mrs Mabalane are the witnesses here with you - your daughter?",

            "Would she like to come forward as well?   I'm speaking about Dipho Joyce Mabalane.  Are you with us this morning?   I also understand that a statement has been made concerning your daughter by Neo Solomon Kgetsana.   Is he here this morning?   Has he not come with you today?\n And then the last person who has also made a statement regarding your daughter is Pulane Gladys Mabalane.  Is she here MMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n2 P MABALANE\nthis morning?   Would she like to come forward?   \n Mrs Mabalane, before I ask you to take the oath I just want to give some background to the period we are talking about in the area that you are coming from.   What is now known as the North West Province incorporates primarily the former homeland, called Bophuthatswana and significant sections of the former Northern Cape.  Bophuthatswana has rightly been described as a jigsaw that doesn't fit, since it was made of seven separate pieces of land spread across the north of Pretoria, Western Transvaal, Northern Cape and the Orange Free State and reflects an ethnic diversity which flew of the face of apartheid's bases for constructing the homeland system.   I just want to say that the area that you come from particularly and your daughter there with you is Huhudi, and the time that we area looking at is 1985.  I would like to again put it in some context.  \n In 1983 14 Huhudi High School children were charged with public violence.  Priscilla Jana defended some of these children and charges were withdrawn against some and other pleaded guilty and were given lashes.  In May 1983 a Councillor Mathloko claims that his house and shop were stoned on occasions after Civic Association and UDF and Huhudi Youth Association Meetings were held.\n In 1984 a small march in August demonstrating against the tricameral elections was held.  An ANC MK member allegedly killed himself with a hand grenade and an attempt was made to set Councillor Dikgole's house alight.   \n In 1985 and that is the year that we are going to be talking about soon, a handgrenade was allegedly thrown by an unknown person at the house of Councillor Dikgole, Chairperson on the Huhudi Community Council.   There were \nMMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n3 P MABALANE\nalso attacks on the houses of Councillor Thiba and a Security Policemen.  On June 16 a commemoration service was held in the Huhudi Community Hall.  After the service, while the crowd was making its way home a Community Councillor, Steven Mathloko, allegedly drives his bakkie into this crowd, badly injuring a girl.  Late that night Mathloko's shop is stoned.   \n Between the 4th and the 11th of July Huhudi Civic Association holds a meeting to discuss rents.  The meeting was addressed by among others Galeng, the Civic leader.   The meeting resolves to write and present a memorandum to Mr Dikgole.  The evening of 11th July the house of Galeng was stoned, allegedly by vigilantes.   On the 12th of July a memorandum is handed to Mr Dikgole.  That evening the house of Francis London, another Civic leader and Publicity Secretary of the Huhudi Civic Association is burnt down.   \n In mid July to November there were intense conflict in the Huhudi community where almost daily reports of the stoning and burning of houses belonging to Community Councillors, collaborators and policemen is reported.  Nicholas Ntusi, an activist from Huhudi is burnt to death by vigilantes.   \n Mrs Mabalane, that is the period that we are dealing with and you are going to be talking about your daughter and I understand your other daughter will also be talking about her sister.  \n I would like you please now to stand up and take the oath.   I would like your daughter to stand up as well.",
