            "In 1985 on the 24th of November there was a UDF meeting, organized by the Youth League and we were from that meeting.  The meeting stopped at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  I was together with Maria and Segofatso.  While we were in Mahura a van approached us, which was full of people - people armed with sjamboks, knives, swords and many things.\n They stopped next to us.  They started chasing us.  They caught us and they put us into a shop and started assaulting us with sjamboks and knopkieries.  They hit me a lot on my head.  Everytime I would touch my head it would be so soft.  They hit me until I couldn't feel the pain anymore.\nMMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n2 F M NKOSI\n They phoned the police and the police came.  There was a policeman among them, called Venter.  When he got into the shop, belonging to Steven Matkloko, he said to me, the bitch is also among the group.  They picked me up and threw me into the Landrover.  There was a Landrover and a Hippo outside the shop.\n They then drove off, we went to Mr Hoffman Galeng's house.  They found Mr Galeng's brother sitting on the stoep.  They also assaulted him until he fainted.  They picked him up and also put him into the Landrover.  Bulufu was the person who did this.\n As I mentioned there was a Landrover and a Hippo and this van belonging to the killers.  They called themselves the Inkathas and the police called them the A team.\n They assaulted me in such a way that the other one amongst them said, please stop, don't kill her.  There was one of them carrying a knife in his hand.  He wanted to stab me.  And this was a woman.\n They then took us to the hospital.  We spent three days in the hospital, but every time we were guarded by the police - two in number.  We spent three days in hospital and they released us into the cells.  \n We were charged for public violence.  We were told that we threw Mr Mathloko's house with stones.  I asked them why should we be charged with public violence, because those people assaulted me and I didn't do anything to them.  And they said, no you were throwing Mr Mathloko's store with stones.\n We stayed there in the cells and we were released on R200 bail.  The case continued and so forth.\n We again, in 1986 on the 12th of June, the state of \nMMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n3 F M NKOSI\nemergency was introduced and many people were arrested under it.  I was one of those people who got arrested and they took us to Kimberley.\n At Kimberley we were released after three months and two weeks and then we went home.\n Since those people assaulted me, those people who called themselves Inkatha and the police.  They assaulted me on the head.  Even I can't hear clearly with my ears, because of what happened to me.",
