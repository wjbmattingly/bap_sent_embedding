            "It was in 1985 on the 14th of July.  I made a mistake when I said it was on the 2nd of July. It was the 14th of July.\n It was when my mother sent me to the shop, it is a shop in Mariri Street and when I went to the shop I met a group of the youth singing a song at the corner.  It was on the day that a meeting was held.   Now they didn't want to disperse immediately after the meeting.  They waited at the corner to sing.  And I went into the shop and bought what I was supposed to buy and then when I left, next door to the shop the youth was throwing stones at a house.\n The police was shooting at the people and I didn't manage to survive, I was also shot with two pelletS that ultimately made me fall.  While I was still on the floor I heard another two shots and they went straight into my leg MMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n2 T MOLALE\nand the other one was on my buttock and the other one was on my back.  And the last one on my head.\n Next to me a person saw that I had fallen and it wasn't only me, but we were two.  Now this person who saw us called for help and somebody came to help.  Mr Galeng was called to take us to the hospital.\n We managed to reach the hospital safely but the police were also waiting for us.  It was at about past six when the shooting took place but at the hospital our parents were called to come and see us.\n We stayed in the hospital for two weeks under the Security guard.  And after that we were forced to sign a statement that we were the people who threw stones at the Councillor's house, because the Councillor was not wanted during the time.  \n Because I wasn't involved in that incident I did not want to sign.  I didn't want to agree to what they were saying.  I refused and they took us then.  They put us in something like a toilet.  There was a tow bar on the floor and for about ten minutes they sprayed us with teargas.\nIt was difficult to get out of that room.  We were suffocating and our faces were very hot.   The saliva was just flowing out of our mouths and the tears from our eyes.\n They came to pick us up and they assaulted us.  They said we should take out the people who were the leaders, the people who told us to throw stones at that house.  They took us to the cells for two weeks without any charge and after that they said they will assault us again until we tell them the truth.\n I went to the hospital and from the hospital I was \nMMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n3 T MOLALE\nsent to Kimberley and then I asked my parents to accompany me to Kimberley.  I was still under police guard.  \n I stayed in Kimberley for two to three days.  My parent was called and it was my mother.\n From Kimberley we went to Bloemfontein.  I was not in a stable condition.  The four pellets have been removed from my body but the other one was still remaining in my body.  At Bloemfontein they could not take the pellet out of my body.   \n I listened to stories that if I drink a lot of Coke the pellet would stay in my body until they can be in a position to remove it.   \n From the Baragwanath Hospital we came back home for the case, but after that we were discharged.  Nobody was found guilty.\n Thereafter I had a problem with the pellet that couldn't be removed from my head.  I was under treatment from a doctor at Vryburg.  I had many problems with this pellet that was in my head because I can't hear well when someone speaks to me.  I hear here and there and I can't see properly with my eyes.   Other things I can't remember because of the pellet that is still in my head.  It is also very problematic for me to remember of the other events that occurred to me here and there.",
