And why I was still wandering some other child also came to tell me that the child was being beaten by the police.  And they actually took him away to the police station at Motswedi.\n I went to the store to ask what did the child do at the store?   When I got inside the store they told me there was nothing he did at the store.  And I left the store, I went to the phone.   I was with another person when I was going to the phone.  \n When I phoned he asked who was there?    I asked as to who took Victor and they said Victor is not there.  Victor was taken into the car to grounds nearby.\n Then we left for the ground to see where the child was.  When we got there they actually blocked me so I could not \nMMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n2 MS LEBELWANE\nsee anything.  There were other four people who actually took me home.\n Whilst I was at home, wandering what could be done they came in to tell me that the child has died.  \n On that day at night I don't know exactly what happened but people came by.  On the 15th I saw that the child in the coffin, I saw some marks on his forehead.  And I didn't know exactly why, what was the cause, what happened.\n Then we buried the child.  When we got back from the cemetery the police sprayed teargas on us.  It was just confusion going on.",
