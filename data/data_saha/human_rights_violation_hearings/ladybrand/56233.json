When they come they were having stones.  They threw stones at my house.  They broke all my windows.  I was in the kitchen then.  I took my children and put them under the table, and then I was looking.  They broke, then from there they went to the shop.  They came again and threw stones at my house up to half past three.  After that they went back.  I didn't see where they went.  I took my children.  I said to my daughter she must go and fetch a blanket for me so that I'll be able to carry the small one.  After we went outside the house to my next-door neighbour.  I sought accommodation at my neighbour.  then I said to my neighbour, \"I don't know what is happening.  I don't know where I am going to sleep.\"  She said, \"I will give you accommodation up to the following day in the morning.  Whilst I was still at her place up to the morning, before then, whilst I was still there, my daughter went outside and then she drank water, then returned and said, \"Our house is burning.\"  When I looked through the window I could see that the house was burning.  There were some boys whom we were with at my neighbour.  While we were outside I heard somebody say, \"Here they come.\"  We returned to my neighbour's house.  Then I said to those people I was with in the house that they leave my house to burn, otherwise we will be at risk.  We were even afraid to go outside.  The following day in the morning we went outside.  We looked at my house.  We saw police surrounding the house.  I took my children and went to my parents' house.  That is where I stayed.",

I heard a noise in the township.  When I tried to look around I was not able to locate the noise, but I heard gunshots, but I didn't know where the gunshots came from.  My grandson came, then said to me, \"Mr Machona has shot my uncle.\"  Whilst I was still asking where he was shot, whilst I was still surprised, the child began to cry.  I waited there.  Whilst I was still waiting I heard a cry from certain women.  They were carrying my son-in-law, and they brought him to the house.  Then I went inside the house with them.  Then I said to them they should make him lie on the sofa.  After some time a car came to take him to the hospital.  He was in the car with my sister's daughter, who was shot also, but she was still alive.   When the owner of the car was on the road, or on his way to Aliwal North, together with my son-in-law and that daughter, the car which took my son and other people, they were stopped by the police and they were led to the police station.  Whilst I was still waiting to hear the owner of the car to give me a report then he - a certain person came to me and said, \"Are you still here?  The car which took the victims has been taken to the hospital - to the police station.\"  I went to the police station together with the people I was with in the house.  When we arrived at the police station they agreed that we should go in.  Inside we found that those children were still at the police station.  My son arrived whilst he was still alive at the police station, but when we arrived there he was dead.

We can see that it was a painful experience for you to talk again about the death of your son.  It's never been resolved.  The people who shot him and your son-in-law have never been charged, they've never been convicted, and it seems as though this is the first time that you have ever had an opportunity to come forward in public and tell the story about your son and your daughter's husband, and your daughters, Mzwakhe and Caroline, who were also shot.  The story that you have told is similar to other stories we have heard in other parts of the country, where councillors who sat in councils which were established and set up by the Government were not accepted by the people, and we've heard in other parts of the country that there were frequently conflicts between these councillors and residents of the township.  And from what you have told us the council members in this township at Rouxville were members of the IFP, and that they enjoyed a very close relationship with the police, and from what you have told us it was two of these councillors who shot and killed and injured members of your family.  We don't know why these cases weren't properly investigated.  We will try to get hold of these documents from the police station to see what sort of investigations were done.  We know that it's very difficult for a mother to come and talk about the death of her children, and we thank you very much for being brave enough to come here and tell us that story, and we hope to be able to give you some information about why your family members died in this way.

Most of the evidence that we have heard over these many months that we have been sitting has been between two parties who were diametrically opposed to each other, the IFP or the ANC, the Security Branch and the UDF, things like that.  Every now and then we have come across cases where people or organisations who have very similar principles to each other also fall out with each other, and that is also part of our history.  It's a very unfortunate part of our history, and it's very unfortunate and very sad that people, ANC Youth members who were, and maintain that they were, fighting for democracy in this country, should have resorted to something so fundamentally undemocratic like stoning people's houses and cars, simply because they disagreed on certain minor issues of principle or organisational strategy.  And we hope that those days are over.  But your evidence is important because it has drawn attention to that sort of conflict, which took place in many parts of this country.  We've heard evidence in places in KwaZulu-Natal and in the Eastern Cape, where members of the same organisation fought and killed each other.  We've heard evidence from the IFP in KwaZulu-Natal, where people who were IFP members, but refused to take part in night operations, night camps as they were called, people who moved around the township at night - because certain IFP members refused to take part in those operations they were also attacked and killed by their own members.  So we've heard a lot of evidence similar to that you have given.  So we thank you again for coming and telling us that information.

            "  It was in 1992 when SANCO was launched in Ficksburg and there were problems between SANCO and the ANC, and this man called Pius Molefe Mohlome is the man behind this whole problem.  He did not want to accept that he cannot be a leader for all the organisations within the township.  Now he wanted the ANC as its leader, and he also wanted to be the leadership in the SANCO.  And on top of that he designed a badge, and we could see that he was troublesome, and this badge indicated that SANCO still existed in the township and it was under his leadership.  Now, it appeared many a time that this man was not in favour of peace.  It so happened that when SANCO was just launched, and when the people were told that they will have to have a representative, Mr David Thamahe was chosen as the chairperson of SANCO in Mukaleng(?).  At that time I was serving within the executive of SANCO, I was the media liaison officer.  Now, at the time of these conflicts of which organisation to lead and which not Pius himself was so keen to sell us out to the administrator.  Now, during those days the administrator was in charge, and we were against this notion of selling us out because previous he had been a policeman.  That was before he became the chairperson of the ANC.  Now, it clearly showed that Pius was taken by the white people, that is the administrator and them.  They made him leave his job and be involved in the ANC so that we people think that he is building the ANC.  And on the other side we were going to be thinking that he was working for the people, and yet he would be building his nationalist ideas.  We came to realise that he was a destroyer, and he wanted to be the only brilliant man.  We now wanted to keep a distance between himself and us, and this conflict erupted.  He became friends with police.  Now, during this relationship between himself and the police we found ourselves under attack at our homes.  I did not even understand what wrong did I commit, because in 1992 in August my home was destroyed.  The reason behind the destroying of the house nobody knows.  He went to my home and destroyed it.  They destroyed our house while my mother was still in the house.  She was 83 then, and they stoned her and she went to the hospital to be stitched on that night.  Just a minute after they left, that is Pius and them, because I heard them saying, \"Let us go because we are finished,\" and Siphumudi, one of them, said, \"No, can't we go back because I saw him getting underneath the bed.\"  Just a minute after they left the police came in so quickly.  I asked myself and I thought to myself, \"This is just a foul play.  The police are involved with these people.\"  I did not want to concentrate on that issue during that time because I was worried about my mother.  I called Med-Risk and they quickly arrived.  The police were around, that is Sergeant Sawane and them, and they connected me to this white man from Med-Risk.  And this white man from Med-Risk came with a message and he said, \"Med-Risk is not going to help, because this is the new South Africa and you wanted it just this way.\"  You know, I had to laugh because this white man was talking something I could not understand.  My mother was injured, she was bleeding, I had to attend to her because her forehead was hit.  Yes, they did remove her.  I was satisfied that they attended to her.  They went to the hospital, where she was admitted.  Sergeant Sawane told me to write a statement.  No, he asked me first, \"Are you going to submit a statement?\"  I said to him, \"Sawane, you have seen what happened.  Now, is it necessary to write the statement because you are already my witness?\"  He said, \"No, my friend, I would like you to submit a statement,\" and indeed I wrote a statement.  I wrote in my statement that I did not see Molefe Mohlome with my own eyes, but I heard his voice when he said, \"Comrades, we have done the job, let's leave.\"  My mother was at the hospital at that time and she came back home.  I am still worried about my mother really.  She is in deep trouble.  She cannot speak, she cannot walk, she is just a person, a helpless being.  I do not know what to do to make ends meet.  You know, sometimes when I meet Pius along the street I become very angry, and I decided to leave this issue because I wanted to revenge and my mother said to me, \"My son, do not revenge.  God is on our side.\"  Even at this stage I am troubled by my mother.  That's why I am here today.  I thank you.  I heard Mr Semakale has already mentioned that how many people were affected by the attacks on their houses.  We found petrol bombs in the house before they could explode, but the doors were broken down, the windows were shattered, and I think the intention was to kill me because the roof is even damaged.

We've also reached a very significant point in the history of the Truth Commission.  This is the last hearing for victims that will ever be held in this country, and it brings to a close one of the most far-reaching steps that this new Government has ever taken to acknowledge the loss, the pain, the suffering of thousands of victims of this country's political past.   And that is the first and one of the most important jobs of this Commission, is to provide victims, like the ones we see here today - to provide them with a public forum at which they can tell their stories, and at which they can be publicly acknowledged in order to help them restore their civil and human dignity, to help them to come to accept the loss of their loved ones, and to help them to move on with their lives.\nBut there's also another very important purpose of hearings such as this one today, and that is to assist us, the Commission, with our very vital work, which is to establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes and the nature of the human rights violations, the gross human rights violations, which took place in this country over the last 34 years.  \nBut just for a minute let's forget what the purpose of the hearings have been and let's focus on the sort of testimony and evidence that we have heard over the last 14 or 15 months since we started holding hearings.  Over these past months we have been taken by victims like yourselves today - we have been taken into what I can only describe as the very heart of darkness, into the most cruel and lonely corners of the human temperament.  We remember the testimony of people like Port Shepstone in KwaZulu-Natal, a man who worked as a cook on a ship, who came back from many months out at sea, back on home leave, to find that his wife and two children had been murdered, had been hacked to death and their bodies had been thrown into a pit toilet.  We think of witnesses that we heard in Brandville in Mooi River, where three women from one family, a grandmother, a mother and a young child of six years old, were brutally stabbed to death by men with spears and bush knives.  \nWe have heard terrible stories of assault, abduction, torture and death from every corner of this country, but we've also heard stories about the strength and the triumph of the human spirit over adversity ... (inaudible - end of Side B, Tape 3, beginning of Side A, Tape 5) ... shocking experiences, and we've heard them stand up confidently and powerfully relate those stories of their past.  And we've heard these people ask the Commission not just to recognise them, and what happened to them, but also to recognise and to remember the thousands of other people who also suffered who have not been able to gain access to the Commission.  And we've seen people who have suffered these terrible violations of their rights, we have seen them caring and nurturing for other people and helping them to gain access to this Commission.  We have been very, very moved by the actions of people like that, and we want to acknowledge them and to say that without them this Commission could not have done its work properly. Now, the obvious thing about victims' hearings like this is that it tends to focus on the evidence of the individuals, it focuses on their pain, their loss, their suffering.  It focuses on the events of that particular day, but often it doesn't tell us much about the big picture, it doesn't give us an overall understanding of what happened in this town, in this country, in this province.  It doesn't tell us who gave the orders for that incident, who supplied the guns, who helped cover up the investigations, who secretly buried the bodies.  \nAnd the Truth Commission has other means, other forums, for finding out that sort of evidence.  We have an investigation unit, we have private investigative inquiries, where we subpoena people and we cross-examine them and ask them questions about what they did, why they did it, on whose behalf they did it.  And we also have the dramatic - often dramatic evidence of the amnesty applicants themselves, perpetrators who come to this Commission and tell us what they did and why the did it, and on whose orders or instructions they were acting at the time.  We have been taken by perpetrators themselves, amnesty applicants such as Security Branch policemen - we've been taken by them to grave sites, and they have pointed out to us where they have shot and killed people and buried them.  And this sort of evidence is vitally important for the Commission, because it doesn't just tell us about the disappearing or the murder of one person, it tells us what the motives of the State were at the time, and why these things were done.  And this Commission is in possession of applications from amnesty from perpetrators which contain very far-reaching and even shocking details about this country's history, and those applications will be made public in due course.\nSo, in this way, with evidence like we've heard today, and at other victims' hearings, and evidence from amnesty applications, we are able to slowly piece together like a jigsaw puzzle the history of this country.\nI am going to give my colleague, Mr Lax, an opportunity to make a few observations on the victims' hearing that we've both attended, and then I will make some concluding remarks about Ladybrand.",

            "MR LAX",
            "Thank you, Chairperson.  One of the things that we have heard across the country - there's been a whole range of evidence, not just by and about acts perpetrated by the State against other people, but of acts perpetrated by the liberation movements, by vigilantes, by other political organisations, and by people even within political parties.  As we heard today, conflict between the ANC and SANCO, conflicts within the IFP, conflicts between the SDUs and MK and the ANC, and conflicts between the PAC and the ANC.  It seems that the levels of conflict knew no bounds in this country, and in every small little community somebody was fighting for dominance in some way or other.\nWe've heard stories across the political spectrum - the bombings, the Magoo's bomb, the Church Street bomb, the St James massacre, the massacre of IFP children outside Port Shepstone, the one striking case we heard there where 11 children were gunned down while they were waiting to go to an IFP Youth Brigade conference, and one of the survivors told us how they were sitting in a half-built house singing songs, as any youth group would sing, and suddenly out of the semi-darkness - it was getting dark - people came running in with guns and just shot randomly.  Terrifying stories.  We've also heard stories of ANC massacres, where ANC people were simply massacred by police and IFP.  And, as Richard has very correctly said, the very lonely stories of people who were tortured in detention, people who were all on their own facing the very powerful men with the whole State behind them.  And then the very moving story we heard yesterday of a policeman who simply couldn't stand being a policeman any longer, and I am sure there were countless others like him who simply couldn't continue to do their jobs and see what was happening to their people.\nThere's one lesson we need to learn from this Commission, is that never again must the police in this country be allowed to become the operatives of the ruling class, the hands of any political party.  This Commission will make recommendations in due course about how we think the structures of our society can be changed so as to prevent human rights violations from happening again, and we will certainly make our voices very loudly heard in that regard in relation to the role of the police.  And we strongly believe that we won't stop the fight against crime, and the fight against violence in this country, until such time as we're able to truly transform the police force.\nJust when we thought we had heard every kind of story possible we come to Ladybrand and we hear a whole new range of stories, each one subtly different from the one before.  And in some ways it's sad that we have come to the end of our victim hearings because we believe we will probably continue to hear new stories, new experiences, and, in a more horrifying way, new concepts in how man's inhumanity to man has no bounds.\nOne aspect that has really struck us has been the incredibly detailed way in which people remember what happened to them, the way in which they tell their stories as if they happened yesterday, not 10 years or 20 years ago, and the incredible variety of their responses in telling their story.  Some people, as you've seen during these hearings, bring an incredible humour to bear on the way they tell their story, and that might be their survival mechanism.  Others are clearly very traumatised by the process.  And yet in all of them, in my personal discussions with people who've given testimony, the vast majority are very grateful to have had that opportunity to be acknowledged.\nAnd so, as we have grappled our way through this process from that first hearing in East London to this hearing in Ladybrand, we have slowly learnt more and more about the cruel past we've had to deal with, but also, as Richard has said, about the incredible bravery and fortitude of people.  \nI'll hand back to Richard at this point.",

            "I think I finally just need to again thank the victims from Ladybrand, Ficksburg, Rouxville, Bothaville, and other parts of the central and southern Free State, who have come here over the last three days to tell us their stories.  They have opened yet another window for this Commission to understand the violent past of this country, and we thank you today for having been brave enough to come here and to tell us your stories and relive those memories.\nThere are a couple of other people to thank, particularly the volunteer staff who have sat with every witness after they have given their evidence and assisted them to get over the experience, and debriefing them;  the TRC staff, particularly those here in the Free State, under the leadership of Mr Moses Pitso.  We thank the police for providing protection and making us feel secure and safe here over these past few days, and the interpreters for their excellent work.\nI want to say a special word of thanks to the media, to the SABC radio, television and the newspapers, not only for reporting on this hearing, but for the many, many hearings that they have reported on throughout the country.  We have travelled a long and often very difficult road together over the past 14 months through the Free State and KwaZulu-Natal, and I am sure many of us will miss the intense experiences that we have all gone through, and the camaraderie that has developed between everyone.\nObviously this process is not finished.  We're not having any more victim hearings, but we are having many other hearings.  We're having institutional hearings, hearings into the role of the press, hearings into the roles of the legal system.  We've just finished a hearing into the role of the medical system.  We will be holding a very long and important event hearing in August into the role of the State in training para-militaries.  So the Truth Commission certainly hasn't come to an end, we still have much work to do, particularly the work of making findings.  We have to make findings in respect of each victim and each perpetrator, so our work will continue for many months to come.\nBut again thank you to all those people - I forgot to mention the people who provided the sound system.  Thank you very much.  Please remember that as you go, those people that have these earphones please leave them on the chairs.  They are no use to anybody outside.  And  I am going to ask one of our staff members from Bloemfontein, the Reverend Bosman, again to lead us as we sing the national anthem.  Thank you very much.",
