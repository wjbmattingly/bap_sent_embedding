And they said I should join them, I should help them, support them while they were singing.  Yes, I joined them and I started singing along with them.  A police Casspir approached from the west.  That was a Hippo.  It was approaching from a direction just not far from where we were, and a second Hippo approached and it came straight to us because we were at Mokwena Street.  We only heard gunshots, and we ran for cover until I ran into a house.  Because of the situation I could not go to the hospital, but the next morning a man took us to the hospital.  On arrival at the hospital I was x-rayed, trying to remove all the bullets.  And after that we were all pushed into the van and we were taken to the CID offices.  When we arrived at their offices we were then taken to the cells.  From the cells we were driven to Jamestown, and a tear gas canister was released in the van until we arrived at Jamestown Police Station.  That is where we were put in the cells.  At about 8 o'clock a white man without a police uniform came to us and he told us that we were making noise.  And he also had a tear gas canister in his possession.  He threw it at us.  Sir, it was terrible in that cell because he closed the door.  We were just packed in the toilet because we wanted to get water to get rid of the tear gas.  We spent that night without any blankets, not even one.  And after a day or two we were taken to Calamazembe(?) Prison.  That is at Bekkersdorp.   When we arrived at Bekkersdorp we were put in the cell and we spent 21 days.  We were taken back to Aliwal North thereafter.  We were each given a bail of R100,00.  After a few days we went back to the Court of Law and we were told that all the charges against us were dropped.  That is basically the gist of the first story.",

            "  Ja.  In fact I would like to say - I am aware that you asked me to first, you know, relate my activities before ... (inaudible) ... get the point.  My second point I would like to say that, you know, my story is basically two-phased, I mean in that I was a participant against the apartheid system itself, and I never regretted my involvement, you know, in politics against apartheid.  And I was - I think I was one of the dedicated people in South Africa, and no one of course during my participation in South Africa - no one who knew me at that point in town, you know, could even doubt my participation.  And during that time I had the blessing of having the contact of people like Mrs Winnie Mandela when she was still in Brandfort.  And I was also one of the people who used to like welcome, you know, renowned politicians at that point in time in Bloemfontein, people like Terror Lekoto, when they came to Bloemfontein.  I was one of the people who met them.  Also Molefe.  You name them, the list is endless.  And eventually of course, when - I mean eventually I joined the underground structure of the ANC.  I was an underground operative, even though most of my friends inside the country didn't know that.  They only learnt about that after I had left the country, and they were shocked to hear that.  Of course that was the rules of the game at that point in time.  And unfortunately at some stage - I think 1984 - when I was at UNISA(?), a student at UNISA, and where of course I was also assisted by Winnie Mandela to gain admission at that institution.  I was working for the ANC still at that time, and I happened to go to Maseru, or Lesotho, on the organisation's nomination, and on my way back from Lesotho now, I don't know for some strange reason, I was confronted by the South African Police at the border.  I don't know whether they knew that I was there or they were just - you know, it was just a coincidence for them to come across me.  I don't know about that one.  For sure they'll be able to explain that if, you know, approached.  But the people who confronted me - one of them I know very well, it was a policeman by the name of Marapo.  I knew him very well and I still know him very well even today.  And then one of them was a white policeman whom I think it was Gert Prinsloo because I have had some dealing with him before.  I mean I was detained on various occasions.  But he left Bloemfontein for quite a while, so maybe when he came back I was not sure whether it was, you know, the same policeman, because in fact the policeman that I knew very well at that time was Andrew Prinsloo more than Gert.  So I was, you know, detained, handcuffed, and they wanted to know what I was doing in Maseru, or in Lesotho.  And I just told them that I had gone there to see a girlfriend of mine, and unfortunately they did not buy that story.  And they ended up detaining me, and they had took certain things from me.  One of them was my passport, because I had gone to Lesotho legally anyway, and my diary, and a train ticket.  At that time there was a train from Bloemfontein to Lesotho, even though it went as far as - wherever, the Maseru border.  So I had a return ticket which was, you know, in my possession, and I think some photos that I had with me.  Those are definitely the things that I can remember that I had at that time.  Very shortly they said to me that they knew that I was on information, which of course I denied at that time, and they decided that, you know, they knew - they also said that they knew that I was sent by Mrs Mandela, which I also denied, and of course I was not sent by Mrs Mandela to Lesotho.  And they said to me they were also aware that even though I was at varsity at that time my mission was not necessarily to study, but I was continuing furthering the ANC missions.  And they had decided, as South African representatives of the Government, that I am undesirable and I am not needed in South Africa, and they said I will have to go back to my comrades in Lesotho.  But then I denied any knowledge of comrades in Lesotho.  After some while - after, you know, some time, you know, they tortured me and all that, and they put me in a car.  It was a white Fairlane, I still remember, and they drove, you know, to the river bank.  I think the river is called is called Caledon, if I am right, but they took me to the river that separates South Africa and Lesotho.  And when we got there Marapo pulled me out of the car and they wanted me to jump into the water.  Well, at that time I could not swim.  I know how to swim now, but at that time I did not know.  So they said I should, you know, get into the water, you know, and go across.  Well, I refused because I was not quite sure how deep the level of the water was at that time.  The person whom I will refer to as Prinsloo at this point, Gert Prinsloo, took out a gun.  In fact both of them had guns, Marapo and Prinsloo.  Prinsloo pointed that gun to me and he said he was going to count up to 10, and if I was not in the water by that time then he was going to fire.  Then he started counting.  I still resisted.  So I think when he was about at count seven or so, and the tone was going up, you know, because he was saying one, two, and then when he gets to six he was saying eight, seven, you know, the tone went up.  Marapo pushed me into the water, and I also ended up getting into that water, and then I went across.  As I am saying I was not quite sure how deep the water was.  Fortunately I managed to get to the middle of the water, and at that time the water was more or less, you know, at my chest level, and I managed to go across.  I was not stubborn as such, but I indicated to them that they were just wasting their time because I am coming back.  So I left the river, I went back to Lesotho.  I contacted congress in Lesotho, ANC Congress, and then I related the story.  I made it a point - I made it clear to them that I wanted to come back home.  I wrote a letter, which I believe, you know, was given to the comrades inside the country, and I said they should organise that for me.  And I was prepared also to take a public platform exposing the system, you know, the police, you know, what they did to me.   And one of the letters, if I still remember very well, was supposed to have reached Mrs Mandela.  Then I was told, I don't know, that my mother went to see Mrs Mandela for the first time because she was really worried, and I was more or less known, you know, in the country, and, you know, my abduction spread like wildfire, because even at UNISA itself I am told people were very worried and they thought I was dead.  Because even after reaching, you know, exile, I could not communicate and tell people that okay, I was safe and all that - you get the point.  So they only knew that I had disappeared, they system had abducted me, and they were not quite sure what happened to me.  However, I made it a point after some time that at least my mother was informed, and I am told, as I said, she went to see Mrs Mandela, and they apparently tried to make efforts for my return.  And after a while - we discussed this with comrades in exile, and they indicated to me that it was going to be dangerous for me to come back because it was not - I mean in fact people were not sure what was going to happen to me if I had to come back at that point in time.  And it was felt that - I mean even though I could expose the system, but eventually maybe they would - you know, I would come back and maybe this time they would kill me.  And on the basis of the advice which was given to me then I decided to stay in exile, reluctantly of course, because I really wanted to come back and expose, you know, the police.  So when I was in Lesotho - well, I did a lot of things for the movement, and then eventually of course I went to various countries until I reached Angola.  I underwent military training.  I did quite a number of whatever assignments in the organisation, and I have no doubt that I was trusted in the organisation, because some of the assignments that I did were very sensitive assignments.  And then eventually during my stay in exile I - of course I went to different countries, and then eventually I found myself in Zimbabwe.  And when I was in Zimbabwe I had another mission which I was given by the organisation, and I think some time in 1978 - 1988 or so, there was some sort of - I don't know what to call that, but basically many comrades were arrested in the organisation for being suspected of working for the system, and some of them were basically people that we knew to be renowned and respected commanders in the organisation.  And some of us in the lower levels started asking ourselves questions that, \"I mean if these people are really enemy agents how did they find their way to the top, to that level?\"  And then we started, you know, thinking and debating this thing amongst ourselves.  It means there is something wrong there at the top.  And at that time unfortunately some of the people that I was supposed to report to, whom I am not necessarily going to name now - you get the point - we sometimes used to feel that there was something wrong with them.  And unfortunately some of them - according to the information that I had some of them I also, you know, I felt very much uncomfortable.  And then I decided - it was at that time that I decided that no, I am not going to take this assignment any more.  Instead I opted to go to school.  And one of the people that I approached - in fact the only people that I approached about that was Comrade Chris Hani, because he was more or less connected to the assignment that I was given by the movement.  And then I intimated to him when he was in Zimbabwe that I am not continuing with the assignment, instead I wanted to go to school.  Comrade Chris said, \"Okay, I have no problem with that if you say you want to go to school.  However, the procedure is that at least we have to write a letter to the MHQ,\" that is the military headquarters in Lusaka, \"just informing them as a formality.  So I know already, but at least we have to write a letter to the MHQ,\" which of course I did.  I wrote a letter, I gave it to the deputy-chief rep in Lusaka - in Zimbabwe.  That was Comrade Mhlope.  And then, okay, he promised me that the letter would reach Lusaka, and then I think after a week or so he told me that the letter was sent to Lusaka.  After some time I did not get a response from, you know, the headquarters in Lusaka.  I wrote another letter to Lusaka again via the same chief rep's office.  There was no response.  And at that time I think I was, you know, beginning to be a little bit fidgety because, you know, I wanted to enrol during that year at the University of Zimbabwe or any other college.  Then I approached the chief rep's office, indicating to them that in the absence of a response from Lusaka I wanted to start processing my whatever - my application for schooling.  And Comrade Madizela indicated to me that no, he was not going to have anything to do with this.  Then I waited, and then after a while - I don't know if, you know, I am taking too long, you wanted me to stop.",

            "  In fact a lot of things, you know, took place.  So what happened is that, well, I spoke to Comrade Madizela, who was the chief rep then, and I was surprised.  I mean his, you know, response was a very negative one - if you get the point - and he was not co-operative at all.  Eventually I - and I indicated - you know, I intimated this to my comrades that I was staying, that - because there were some also who wanted to go to school, who were a little bit - you know.  I can't say everybody was dissatisfied.  We were not necessarily dissatisfied about what was going on in the movement, but I was a little bit, you know, dissatisfied about how certain people handled certain things, if you get the point.  Not necessarily about the organisation, because I really loved the organisation.  I was very much dedicated to it.  So when Comrade Madizela reacted in the manner in which he did then I indicated to the Congress that I was staying, and I can prove everything that I am saying here.  I said, \"You know, if he does this to me I will sort this thing my - you know, my own way,\" if you get the point.  \"I am going to follow the channels, but if he doesn't want to then I will see how I do this thing, but definitely I am going to go to school.\"  Then he had his attitude, and then he eventually said to one of the comrades who was helping, you know, people with scholarships and bursaries, that he should not help me.  And I was very much disappointed because he said that after we had had a meeting with them in his office, and then he said, \"You must never help those comrades.  You know, those comrades will simply have to leave Zimbabwe,\" and all that, if you get the point.  I said to the comrades in point - I think it was Comrade Solly.  We used to call him Solly.  I am sorry to mention people's names without consulting them, but anyway the people that I have mentioned some of them really never did anything whatever wrong, or, you know, negative against me.  You know, the comrades was genuinely trying to help me at that point in time.  And Comrade Madizela said whatever said, then I said to the comrade that, \"Okay, I realise that you tried to help me out, but anyway thanks for that.\"  And then after that I went to various organisations which used to help refugees at that time for scholarship, and some of them of course were willing to help me, but the indication was that, I mean, they don't help individuals.  It's either you are an individual refugee, in which case they can assist you as an individual, or if you belong to an organisation then they help you through the organisation, you see.  And one of the organisations that I went to was the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and they also told me the same thing anyway, because at that time I indicated to them that I only wanted help, but I didn't want to leave the organisation, I only wanted a scholarship.  So what happened is that the UN said it could only help me if I could bring some sort of a letter from the office indicating that I was a member of the ANC, if you get the point, because I didn't have an identification card of my own.  I was identified through the organisation.  So I went back again to the chief rep's office requiring for - or requesting a, \"To whom it may concern,\" just a letter, you know, acknowledging that I was, you know, a South African refugee.  And unfortunately I could not get that help.  Eventually then I said no.  Then the UN said to me they could register me as whatever.  They could give me an ID, but before they could do that I would have to go to, you know, to the government to get an identity whatever recognition.  I went to the Zimbabwe Government, and unfortunately the applications at that point in time were, you know, processed by the Central Intelligence Organisation, that is the Security Branch of the organisation - I mean the country.  I went there and the ANC was consulted.  Comrade Mhlope came.  He was called.  He came to the Security Branch of the Zimbabwean Government.  He asked me what I was doing.  I explained to him, and the reasons why I was there.  And then he said, \"Okay, Comrade, we can go back to the office, then we'll be able to discuss this maybe in a more whatever amicable way.\"  I said, \"It's fine.\"  Then I was prepared to abandon, you know, the process that I had already started.  So I went back to the residence where I used to stay.  Comrade Mhlope never showed up that evening.  I think two days or so passed.  After that I went back to the Government, telling them that I was proceeding with my application.  After some time to my surprise the ... (intervention) ",

And I also indicated to the Government of Zimbabwe together - you know, and also at the UNHCR office, that I only wanted an identification, you know, an independent identification as a refugee.  I didn't want to leave the organisation, I wanted to still remain a member of the ANC.  Unfortunately when I was there the movement sent a security guy, if you get the point, to come and fetch me.  So I resisted.  I am not going to mention them now by names, but if I am called upon to do that then I can always mention them.  Anyway.  And then the guys came.  Instead I was surprised.  They wanted to remove me by force from there.  Then I resisted, and unfortunately that caused a lot of, you know, commotion outside the, you know, the offices outside the - you know, outside the Zimbabwean or whatever security offices in Harare.  As a result of that I mean many people came.  It attracted whatever - the commotion that took place attracted a lot of people, and then the police - I mean the Security Police of the Zimbabwe Government, you know, put me into the car and they drove me to the police station.  They decided to whatever - to whatever - to lock me up.  I stayed in the cells I think for about two days, after which then I indicated to them that I am not going back to the ANC, now I am resigning.  I told them straight that, \"Now I am resigning,\" I don't want to have anything with the organisation at that point in time.  Then I was taken to the refugee camp in Zimbabwe, where I stayed, and then after some time I was called upon to - I mean to a hearing for an application for refugee status.  So in that hearing one of the things that I indicated, because I was asked about my safety in Zimbabwe, they wanted to know - in fact they indicated to me that how would they be able to make sure that I was safe in Zimbabwe because they had no control over the security of the movement.  Then I indicated to them that I doubt that the Zimbabwean Government can say that it had no control over the security of the movement because it was a government.  And I also indicated that I suspected that there were some people even in the Security Police of the Zimbabwean Government who were, you know, conniving with our security guys because of the braveness that they had, you know, when they went to fetch me from their offices.  So I think some of the things which I said there made certain people feel unhappy, and as a result of that they decided to send me to Lusaka, without the knowledge of the UN unfortunately.

She first approached the Zimbabwean Government, wanting to know about my whereabouts, and the Government told her that I voluntarily left Zimbabwe for Zambia.

And the conditions were terrible enough, if you get the point.  And at that time I didn't mind because I knew that - I regarded the Government basically as my enemy, and I didn't expect any sympathy from the Government, if you get the points, so I accepted the conditions that I found myself in.  But when I was locked up by my own organisation, the organisation that I had sacrificed so much for it, and for no apparent reason, without any explanation whatsoever, I was really - I mean I really shed tears at that point in time because, as I am saying, no explanation was given, I didn't know why I was arrested.  And the conditions were - I am sure that there are people in South Africa who were, you know, put in gaol conditions which were very terrible, but unfortunately the conditions that I found myself in when I was in the movement or whatever's detention were more terrible than the conditions that I found myself in when I was detained in South Africa, because during my imprisonment here in South Africa at least I had a toilet that I could use, and when I was the organisation or whatever's detention I had no toilet, I just had a tin, which was a small tin, which I had to use.  And the room was dark.  In fact I cannot even call it a room.  It looks like a room from outside, but inside it's basically like a dug-out because it's very deep, you go downstairs, and with - I can say with no ventilation, because there are no windows, there's nothing.  And I mean it's dark.  I mean you can hardly see a person inside unless you stay for some time.  If you can stay let's say for two or three hours, that's when you start, you know, getting used to the darkness and then you can see a person, you know, inside.  And I mean it was - I mean it was really terrible, I mean, for me, you know, to find myself in conditions like those.  And I remember when I was in detention and in prison here in South Africa we sometimes used to - at some stage we had hunger strikes because we were like complaining about the food that we were given at the prison, but when I was in the movement's detention sometimes I would go without eating at all.  At times I would get like one meal a day, at times, like I am saying, I wouldn't get, you know, food at all, if you get the point.  And there were some sort of flimsy excuses.  And I mean basically they were terrible.  There was - I mean if I was an enemy agent maybe I would have accepted the conditions, but nothing was ever said to me that, \"You are an enemy agent,\" or, \"We are detaining you because of one, two, three.\"  So that is why even today I still want that explanation.  I still want it, I mean, from the movement, and also maybe from the Government side.  And I really want each side to come up clearly and say - if the Government makes insinuations that I was working for it I want them to say that, \"This person was working for us,\" and maybe come with - I don't want them to prove it, a mere allegation is enough.  Then I'll be able to disprove it myself.  And if the ANC can say, \"This person was working for the system,\" I want them to come up with mere allegation.  I am not saying they should prove it, they must just say, \"This person was working for the system.\"  Just allegation is enough, then I'll be able to disprove it, if you get the point.  I am not saying they should come up with evidence or anything like that, if you get the point, but at least I'll be content if I can get explanations.  And I am sorry, I am not trying to make a speech, and unfortunately what happened, and what is still happening - that's why I decided to come here today - is that people don't come to me and say, \"You did one, two, three.\"  Instead they make allegations and insinuations to people who are surrounding me.  And the unfortunate part is that all these things happened, and people knew that I was abducted by the Security Police.  And, as I said, I was very active here in South Africa and in - you know, in Bloemfontein, in Free State in general, if you get the point.  And the people were surprised.  When I came back, you know, I didn't want to have anything to do with politics, and I didn't give an explanation.  Even my own family members they will be hearing this thing for the first time, if you get the point.  They were never political, but they are now today more political than I am, if you get the point.  They are wondering why - what went wrong, and the allegations that the movement is making against me confirm - I mean in fact my attitude, my silence, confirms the allegations that maybe there was something wrong with me, if you get the point, because I decided just to keep quiet, not to say anything against the movement.  I have been quiet.  I mean I went abroad.  Unfortunately I went abroad, I went to school, I did everything, and I was just quiet.  And I struggled to go to school, if you get the point, and I mean people maybe are asking themselves where I got money from, and for sure people are making their own whatever assumptions and allegations, and they don't know how much I struggled to get money to go to school.  And that is why I am saying I decided to take this platform, because I want everything to come out, if you get the point.  People should stop saying all the kinds of things that they are saying.  I want explanations from the Government and also from the movement, then I will be content. Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr Jacob.  You took a long time, but I think for you it's going to be very helpful, especially if you say you are sharing this for the first time.  It looks like you are looking for some form of vindication, as well as getting some communication with people who perceived you otherwise.

            "  It was in April 1991.  It was during Good Friday, on a Friday.  I found work in the mine.  I came home with my friends.  So I made a party with my friends.  Like liquor, we bought liquor and meat.  We were at my friend's place.  Whilst we were still relaxing, we were playing music, we were outside.  On my hands I had a glass of beer.  I went inside to change the record which was playing, then thereafter went outside.  I heard tear gas smoke.  I turned around, saying, \"Comrades, comrades are killed outside.\"  When we looked on a certain direction we heard gunshots at the councillor's house.  He was fighting with another comrade, because all of us were members of the ANC Youth League.   At the time we wanted to defend by throwing stones.  It's then that he called the police and the police came, and they were many.  Some of them were speaking Afrikaans.  They were using tear gas and guns.  We went to a shack house, which we were drinking next to.  We ran inside the house, we closed the door.  A certain policeman arrived next to the window and he threw a tear gas canister inside the house, and other police were in front of the house, and they shot straight to the door.  It went through the door and hit me on the neck.  I started bleeding.  My clothes were bloodstained, then I fell on the bed and I was crying, saying to the comrades, \"They found me.\"  The police threw the - kicked the door, then they threw tear gas again, and they were kicking us.  We were taken to the police van.  They threw tear gas canisters inside that van, and I was helpless and powerless.  Then from there they took us to the police station.  When we arrived at the police station I thought I would be helped because I was bleeding.  One of the police said, \"Fucking comrades, you should have been killed,\" and then I was crying.  One of the police said I should be - one of them should lock me in.  They took me to the doctor after a while.  The doctor placed the blood and gave me pills and say he - after that I thought I was going to be locked again.  We were told that we should leave and then they'll find me at home.  I arrived at home still in pain.  My mother was crying profusely.  The bullet was stuck inside behind my neck.  On a Sunday I was supposed to go back to the mine.  When I arrived there I reported that I was not able to work.  Then they took me to the hospital, they gave me pain-killers.  I was not able to turn my neck.  After some time I was taken to an x-ray as to whether you are still healthy.  Then somebody told me that the doctor wants to see me.  When I arrived at the hospital I found Dr Swart.  He said to me, \"Were you shot?\"  I said, \"Yes, but that doctor said the bullet didn't stick in the flesh, it just passed through.\"  That doctor - Dr Swart said to me, \"That doctor was lying.\"  The bullet was inside my flesh.  He showed me the x-ray picture how the bullet was stuck in my neck.  I didn't believe, but I saw it on the x-ray.  Then he said to me, \"After a week you'll be taken to the hospital for the bullet to be removed.\"  After then I went to the hospital for an operation.  They were able to remove that pellet.  But that doctor said that the bullet didn't stick in my neck.  Since I waited for the case to be presented to Court, but even up to now I was not informed what happened to that case in court.",

            "  I was in the Bethulie district in Platkop when I saw a police van.  In the van was Sergeant John Simano, Constable Bagabu.  Sergeant John Simano came out of the van, then accused me of having an illegal gun which I was given by Faso.  I replied to him that I am not in the possession of a gun.  Then I said to him that he must come in the house and search as to whether there is a gun inside.  They tortured me firstly by pointing guns at me.  They locked me up in the van, then they went into the house, where I was staying together with my brother.  They just went there for a half minute, then thereafter they came out.  Whilst on the road when we were at the tarred road, at Gerrit Dam they stopped.  They said to me I should put off my clothes, but I was left with an underwear.  Then they put me again in the van and they were driving fast.  Then we arrived next to the dam.  When we arrived at that dam we returned again to town.  On our way to town there is a road.  We turned off at the road next to the shooting range.  When we arrived there I found Sergeant Steerman, Sergeant Phillips.  They were at the shooting range.  They made me to take off my clothes and made me to sit down.  They then cuffed me on the table.  On my buttocks I was wet.  They then handcuffed me on the table and they put a hessian cloth on my head.  There are things which they were tying on your fingers, left and right hand.  They were speaking Afrikaans.  Then he said one of them should put it on.  Then I shouted.  From there they would take off the cloth on the head, thereafter I would tell them that I don't have a gun, and I don't know what kind of a thing is a gun.  From there they hit me with batons.  They would electrocute me up to afternoon.  After that they put me again in the van and I was taken to the police station, then from there they took me home.  At home we found my mother and my sister.  My mother said to me what was happening.  I told them that they suspect me to have a gun.  My mother said, \"Here is the house.  Go in and search.\"  Sergeant Steerman hit my mother with an open hand, then they threw a tear gas inside the house.  Inside the house they didn't find a gun.  They took my mother and myself and locked me in the cells from Sunday up to Monday, then on Monday my mother was released.  I was released later.  Then I went home.  When I arrived home my cousin took me to the doctor, to Dr Bates.  Dr Bates examined me.  He just looked at me, then from there he wrote a letter, then from there he said I should go to the police station to open a case.  When I arrived to open a case - forgive me for a while.  On a Monday I asked the station commander to meet with him when they were coming to take complaints from those detained.  Then they sent a station commander.  It was Warrant-Officer Veldman.  When I arrived in his office I found Sergeant Simano in that office.  When I explained everything - when I arrived in that office he said to me, \"Where is the gun?\"   Then the station commander said Simano must hit me with an open hand.  Then I said to him, \"Do you still say to Simano to slap me?\"   Then he said, \"You must give us the gun.  If you don't produce that gun I will tell them to continue with the torture.\"  Then I left that office.  Then they locked me again in the cell.  On Tuesday when I went to the doctor he gave me a letter - I still have a copy of that letter with me - so that I should open a case with that letter.  I went to the police station.  When I arrived at the charge office to open a case I don't remember the police who were there, but they were white policemen.  When I told them what was the cause of opening the case they laughed at me.  Adjutant Veldman talked with them outside.  After some time they were writing something, which I don't know what they writing, right, and then they denied that I should look at that statement.  Then they said they will come to me, but up to this day they haven't come yet.",

Then he said, \"At this farm many communists are sleeping under those trees.\"  That is the farm where I was kept for a long time, like three or - two to three weeks.  A certain old doctor came.  He gave me tablets, then he said I should take two.  These tablets made me to feel numb.  Then they still pursued that I am still a communist.  I produced a paper to show them that I belong to - I am working at the mine.  The warrant-officer teared off that paper, then he took my identity book.  They took me again to that farm.  When I arrived again at that farm they said I raped.  After they said I raped they said I should hold a rock.  The warrant-officer took photos.  My story will be long.  After he had taken these stones, some pictures, he took me and locked me up in the cells at Verkeerdevlei.  I was eating a raw porridge.  Then from there he made me to make a statement so that I should tell.  He informed me how I should formulate my statement.  He took me to Brandfort for a case, where I looked for a doctor.  The doctor said they should telephone Vicky in Verkeerdevlei to come and take me to the doctor.  Vicky arrived.  At dusk Vicky arrived and took me.  He then informed me that I think I am wise.  He detained me at the cell.  There was a certain lady who was having a bottle so that I should urinate in that bottle.  After the day of the trial I was taken to Bloemfontein, but before that in the same van where I was put they loaded a sheep, and this sheep was given to the prosecutor.  All the black people were taken out of the court, only the whites remained behind, and the Magistrate of the day told me that the police didn't bring me there because I was assaulted.  They came with a case that I broke into a house.  Vicky requested to go back with me to Brandfort, and after some time I was sentenced to five years at Grootvlei Prison.  I requested Captain Visser to help me because my body was swollen.  Captain Visser took me to a doctor in Bloemfontein.  That is at Pelonomi Hospital.  I could not eat, I was only vomiting blood, and I asked the doctor what the problem was with me, but the doctor never gave me a reply until today.  I was afraid to reveal this because I was promised to be killed.  They told me that I must never set my foot at that farm at Verkeerdevlei.  They said because it was Verkeerdevlei I was also \"verkeerd,\" I was wrong.  I have a request to the Commission.  I want the money that belonged to my children to go back, and their clothes, and I want the end - or the head of my penis.  That's all I want.",

            "  I was the president elected by the youth after the incident of that time.  There were some youths who were arrested for arson, and I was helping them, I was the co-ordinator to get them the legal representative.  Now the youth elected me to be the leader.  It was the UDF at that time.  And the police started harassing me, not only myself, but my mother too.  That is at home.  I had an incident that took place in 1987, where the police started with the assault which resulted in this mark that I have here.  That was after I mobilised for those who were sentenced in 1986.  And in 1987 I went back to school, and when I went back to school the youth was very active in politics.  And just after Good Friday - Good Friday we had an altercation with a police called Moghele.  Now, this altercation was just a township altercation between himself and myself, but because of the political situation he turned this into politics.  I am now going to tell you about the 1987 incident.  It was after a meeting that was held at the school, and after that meeting it was heard that we had a meeting, and this meeting was illegal.  And after this meeting I think it was to 12 when they arrived.  They took me at home and they told my mother that they want to know exactly the details of the story of the organisation I was in.  And they took me to a police station.  The police from Bloemfontein were called in.  We used to know them as SBs.  They were driving a Skyline vehicle and a kombi.  That is where I was interrogated.  They were asking me about my knowledge in politics.  It was usual that when you are arrested you will negate everything they ask you.  After the police left, the police from Bloemfontein, Moghele was given an order to take me back home.  It was about past three in the morning.  That is where Moghele conducted his own interrogation.  He told me about the township issues and he told me about political issues.  Because I was not afraid of him, that is when he hit me, I hit back and I was injured.  That is where he called in some of the policemen who were there.  They handcuffed my hands behind my back and he was now in charge.  He said they should leave the room, the two of us should be left behind.  He was telling me about the issues of the township, and he told me that I was not going to further my studies at all.  I was doing standard eight in that year.  And he - you know, his wife was a teacher at that time, and he said, \"If my wife is going to encounter any problem about you you must know that your name is going to be Bury Me.\"  And then he hit me with the butt of the gun.  This carried on in that year.  I was picked now and then by the police, but in that year I was arrested twice, the longest 14 days for the state of emergency.  And in 1988 this state of emergency continued.  I was now used to the state of emergency because it was happening so often.  In 1988 in April the schools were just about to close for holiday when we had a bit meeting and some of the members were there.  I remember one of the members who was there, who was the co-ordinator for the meeting, was the brother to the sister who just spoke here today, that is Lifa, who was shot in that year.  If I remember very well he was shot early, and then it was in - early in March, and we buried him in April.  I don't remember very well his shooting.  Yes, he was an active member in the Youth Congress.  He was the co-ordinator.  He was one of those people who were helping me to co-ordinate.  Yes, he had his silliness like any other boy, but the way we understood the matter on the Thursday when he was picked up he informed us that he was leaving, but he was present at the meeting, and he thanked us for taking the struggle forward.  And the next morning when we heard that he was shot - we can't remember very well the date, but it was after he explained to us.  I went to school.  I was at school, but school was not normal to me, and to others who were active, who were taking part.  Now, when we were busy with preparations of the burial the Congress from the SACC in Bloemfontein were helping us.  They gave us donations and some few things that we were in need of, because at his family - he was from a very poor family.  I am now going to talk about the night vigil.  Before the night vigil I was taken by the police for about three hours.  They wanted to understand what was going to happen, because they knew exactly what I was to the youth in general at Lephoi.  That is in Bethulie.  After those hours they released me.  It was round about past six, and we used to call it \"thibelo,\" night vigil in Sesotho.  We started just after 9 o'clock, and the police troubled us a lot, and the house ordered me to go out and talk to the police, to tell them what we expect of them.  I was scared because my life was also at risk with the police, but the mother to the deceased promised to accompany me, so that if anything happens she would come and inform the comrades.  We went to the police to talk to them.  That was just before we had our meal at the night vigil, and we explained to the policemen and they told us that it was their right to stay there and watch, because next-door neighbours to Lifa's family was a policeman.  Now, they thought that we were going to attack the policeman staying next door to Lifa's home.  We left it there and we went back to the house and I explained to everybody gathered there, then they understood, and the vigil went on very well until the morning.  But things took a nasty turn when we were about to start with the funeral.  As co-ordinators we were already at the funeral at 9 o'clock.  The minister of religion arrived, but he was now a changed man.  He told us that he was not going to conduct the funeral of the deceased.  It was Reverend Bechani who was supposed to conduct the funeral.  He gave the authority to the senior man in his church to conduct it.  I think the man was Mr Raliyuko.  The funeral moved to the cemetery, and this reverend asked the senior member of the church to conduct the funeral.  We were chanting slogans, we were singing our songs, and the reverend decided to leave, and he left.  We didn't know what to do, and the people didn't want to take part to help with the burial.  Because of the leadership that I had the people ordered me to carry on with the ceremony.  I don't know whether I did the right thing, but we buried him.  When we went back there was a conflict between the police and ourselves.  As we were proceeding to the house we tried to avoid the policemen.  They drove off.  Then the second time the group of people, the mourners, did not accept it.  They said, \"Is it a sin just to walk,\" and the war broke between the police and the group.  We were hitting with stones and they were hitting back with tear gas.  We managed as the youth to keep it calm.  We arrived at home, we wanted to wash our hands, and a Hippo arrived.  I think it was just one Hippo.  This one was always at home.  Two Hippos arrived.  I ran away because of the shooting that was happening.  Then the sister was telling the truth when she said earlier on we ate the food the next day, because we had to run for our lives.  I want to conclude now.  In 1988 I was arrested.  I was suspected of possession of arms.  That was after June.  I was just coming from the holidays at my brother's home in Soweto.  I spent 90 days in the cells.  That was under the state of emergency.  In those 90 days I was interrogated heavily.  I have policemen that I would like to mention.  I think I mentioned them in my statement.  The first one is Warrant-Officer Strampe, because he was in charge at that time.  He was the ... (intervention)",

            "  Thank you.  The station commander of the time used to visit me at the cell.  He was visiting me, he wanted to convince me to leave what I was doing, to join the force, the police force.  I informed him that I was not interested in politics, and he explained the history of my father, which I doubt he knew at all.  Now I remember one night in July - I don't remember the date because it was during this 90 days of detention.  That is where they undressed me and they grabbed me by my penis and they put - the took the mattress off the bed and they tied me on the bed with the handcuffs and they chained my legs too.  I remember at all times my legs were spread.  I did not even have an underwear because I was really naked.  There was an equipment applied to my private parts.  I do not remember what I told them that day, because when I woke up I was unchained, I was lying on the floor naked as I was, and they asked me, \"Do you still refuse that you went to that place for training and firearms?\" and I negated that, because it is true I didn't go for any training, I wanted to learn as any other school child.  That night I was taken - that was after they have electrocuted me I was taken to a bridge called Henniston Bridge.  This is a bridge between Orange Free State and the Cape, and it has got the Orange River.  I do not know, but I read that that is the highest bridge in South Africa.  There was a bag where they put letters by the post office people.  I was assaulted by those people.  I was put inside this bag and then it was tightened.  I never thought that that bag can afford to carry a person as tall as myself.  You know, I was standing and this bag reached my head.  There was a van.  I can't remember the name they used to give to that van, but we used to call it a 4x4.  It was a Mercedes Benz van, and at the front it has got a chain.  It is used to pull.  That is where they held me, and I was put down into the river, the Orange River.  They put me the third time, and when they put me down for the fourth time that is when I felt that they were now putting me in the water.  I prayed to my God.  I said, \"God, if I don't have any chance to unchain myself please help me,\" because I was chained behind my back.  I was still naked, and they pulled me out.  That was the fifth time, if not the sixth time.  They put me on top of the bridge and they were asking me, \"Don't you want to tell the truth still?\"  Policemen who were there they were white policemen who I cannot remember, and where they came from, but I think they were members of the Special Branch from Bloemfontein.  Now, the black people were there.  Sergeant Mpakathi was there.  He was a sergeant at that time.  Sergeant Simano was there.  He was already a sergeant at that time.  And the other one was Pitso's father.  We called him Mthathaki Pitso.  Then his surname is Moghele.  They tried to assault me, and they wanted to convince me that my life at home can change because my mother was the only breadwinner.  My brother and my sister were already in their homes.  They were married.  During the torture I came to a conclusion.  If I have to struggle this way and let my mother struggle I'd better die in their hands.  Now, I took a decision to run for my life, and run into the river, down the cliff, and die.  This was not an easy decision.  My body was hurting.  All my body was hurting.  And I tried to do just that decision.  I ran, and at the end of the bridge, when I was just about to hold the bridge to jump, Sergeant Mpakathi was on my heels and he pulled me off.  I don't know what he used, but he used his hands.  Whether fists or not I do not know.  He asked me what was my intention.  I told him that I wanted to kill myself because I do not know what truth do they want from me because I gave them the only truth.  Because it was not yet the end of my detention they took me back to the cell.  I stayed in the cell for a few days.  That was before I was taken to Dr Buys.  I requested help from Dr Buys because I was not eating any more in the cell, and I said I wanted to see a doctor.  I requested help.  I wanted him to examine me thoroughly.  He gave me medication and tablets, which I was supposed to take immediately.  When I arrived in the cell I could not walk.  Now, the prison warder was now escorting me into the cell.  After some time this medication was really working in me.  I sat in the cell.  I woke up, and when I woke up the food was next to me.  I could not hold myself because I was so hungry, because this was now the fifth day without food.  I ate that food, and after two days I was taken to the other political prisoners.  This went on for some time, but I liked one thing, you know, I got a chance to study in the cell, and that was the only time I used to study, and I passed in 1988.  In 1989, when I was doing matric ... (inaudible - end of Side A, Tape 5) ... was my mother.  My mother could not bear the burden any more, because I was a trouble and the police were the trouble.  I know I troubled her because I was her child, but now the trouble from the police was an extra burden.  As a parent she was not supposed to have been treated that way.  She was supposed to be a well-respected person.  And in 1989 in February I was taken under the state of emergency and I was taken to a farm and I was put in the water.  I do not remember whether did they have any kind of an animal with them, but I remember when I got out of the water that is where a cat was put.  Every time when I was hit I had this problem of passing out.  On that day I had an underwear with me.  Luckily, because I was not cuffed, they put a cat.  Because I was cold and I was folding my body they put the cat behind me, and it stayed on my back.  I tried to fight it, but luckily I killed it while inside this sack.  When I got out of the bag I had to go back into that water, the water in the dam.  It was a muddy area, but I could not - I could not run away from that mud.  I had to walk on the mud, but luckily I fainted and some of them pulled me out quickly.  I remember this water was deep to my - just below my breast, my chest.  I do not remember whether I fell on my back or I fell on my face. (Inaudible) ... farm that you spoke about?   ---   If I explain it I think it's on the way to Smithfield.  That is from Bethulie.  Today I still suspect that one of the two farms is the one where I was taken to, because the dams on those two farms are alike, they are the same.",

As a young person, I think as young people we have aims that we want to fulfil, because we go to school to reach a certain point in life, a point where parents could not take us to.  If the Commission can meet with the people who suffered, for instance the children at Lifa's family, they became a community problem, not because they are dull in school, no, but nobody takes care of them.  If such people can be taken care of, especially when it comes to education, they should become what they wanted to be.  Because we also had desires in life.  We want to become professionals.  I have got just one parent, and I realise that life is difficult when you work as a contractor, when you work at the municipality, but as a young man, as a young person, you become very conscious when you see a successful person, and you want to follow in his footsteps, and if you get that chance you will definitely use that opportunity.

We were running short of text books, which were not sufficient for all students at school.  The library in Bloemfontein was not able to give us enough books.  We asked therefore our SRC body to make means how they can use the school funds to buy extra books.  They went to this minister that he should sign a cheque, and be given a teacher and some members of SRC committee to go and buy books.

Charles Dickens in one of his books, The Tale of Two Cities, speaks about the best of times and the worst of times, and also one of the biblical authors in the book of Ecclesiastes does itemise or categorise different times in his biblical ... (inaudible) ... based on the socio-religio conditions of his time, and I see the similar situation of our time.  But ours was the worst of times.  We have heard shocking stories, stories of dehumanisation of God's people by other human beings, and I believe that at the day or the time they were doing these things they were also dehumanised, because there are no decent people who could do these things to other fellow human beings.  We have heard about what has been happening on the farms, and I believe that the farms need to be investigated.  And we have heard about some of the doctors who, according to their oath, should be interested in saving lives, who were colluding with the forces which were killing the people.  And I believe some of the doctors need to be investigated.  And one of the bad things about what we are hearing is that some of these policemen are still employed by this Government, and maybe this is an indictment to our Government too of National Unity.  Ours was the worst of times, and we are still going to hear stories during these last two days, and I am sure we are going to hear the stories of the same battle.  We thank the Government of National Unity for having instituted this process of the Truth Commission, otherwise  /we would\nwe would not know about these shocking stories.  \nNow we are going to close, and we are going to sing the national anthem, and please come back tomorrow at 9 o'clock.  Thank you for how you have conducted yourselves.\nNATIONAL ANTHEM\nPROCEEDINGS  ADJOURNED  TO  1997/06/25\n/PROCEEDINGS",
