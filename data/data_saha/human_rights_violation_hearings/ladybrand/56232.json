            "  As my son was a student then those years in Botshabelo township he was a youth who was fighting for freedom within the ANC.  We, as his parents, we were in the leadership of the Apostolic Faith Mission.  My son was harassed by the police all the time.  In some instances he would disappear, and when we looked for him after some two days he would tell us that he was from the police, because they detained him, and he would never tell us the reason why.  But when we go to the police to ask for reasons the police would say, \"Try to discipline your child.\"  It was that kind of a lifestyle all the time.  When the situation worsened in July 1989 we had a night vigil for the tombstones of my mother and my father, which was on the 29th, on Saturday.  We have already unveiled those tombstones.  A group of police came, though they were in private clothes.  Others were outside.  Others knocked heavily.  As we didn't sleep on a Friday night, on Saturday we came from then unveiling of the tombstones, and Saturday evening we were asleep.  When they knocked, and when I opened for them, two policemen - I don't know as to whether they were police or not, but I would say they were police because they introduced themselves as police - they squeezed my hand and said, \"Where is your son, Bufi?\"  The other one light me with a torch on the face so that I should not be able to see him or identify him.  And other police were already in the house and were asking where my son was.  They took his eldest brother and they said he should point out where his younger brother is.  I told them that that person is ill, they must not take him because he's ill.  Then they said to me they will now start to kick me.  Then they said I am claiming to be sick.  They took the elder brother with them and they found where his younger brother was.  He disappeared for that day, on a Saturday and Sunday.  On Sunday evening they released him.  Those kind of things happened, that he was detained and released in many instances, and then in 1990 in December, on the 9th, he told us that he's going to court because he is arrested.  We then asked him what is the reason for his arrest.  Then he said to us the police alleged that he has raped.  He went to court.  In court he had a letter from the Botshabelo Hospital.  The medical certificate was showing that he is a person who is suffering from stress.  It was just a letter showing his sickness.  After that then in court they say those are the tricks from the comrades, they make tricks with medical certificates or letters from the doctor.  They will examine themselves in Oranje Hospital to verify as to whether he has that kind of a disease.  The rape case they didn't even materialise as to whether he was arrested for rape or as to whether he was arrested for other cases, because there were many cases which were followed up by the police as he was a student, and then as a member of COSAS.  Other cases were left off because of there were so many.  On the 10th I went to Oranje Hospital to look for him and I didn't found him in that hospital.  They informed me that they have never seen such kind of a person in that hospital.  When I returned to ask the police about his whereabouts they told me that he has been sent to Oranje Hospital.  We waited until the 11th, the 12th and the 13th, and on the 14th, a Saturday, we were not present in our township, we went.  We went because of our religious ministry, as we pray for people.  They found only the children at home.  That's my sister's child and the sister to the deceased, who is with us today.  They informed them merely that, \"Is this where Samuel is staying?\"  Then they said yes.  \"We are coming to inform you that that person has since died.  He has hanged himself.\"  Those children were just there and we were not present.  The children were crying.  I didn't go to the police, I went to the youth organisation, the African National Congress Youth League, to inform them about the incident which has happened to my child.  They informed me to settle because I am disturbed.  They themselves would find out what actually happened at Oranje Hospital.  When they arrived at the Orange Hospital they found blockades that no person enters there freely, only people who have exceptional cases should go through.  They must come inside if they are accompanied by a family member.  The following week we went there.  When we arrived at Oranje Hospital we found the police waiting for us there.  They said if we don't have a special permit to enter we will not be allowed entry, we should go and look for that permit.  We asked them as to where should we found that permit.  They said we should go and look for it at Verwoerd Building.  When we arrived at Verwoerd Building the security there sent us to Swart Building.  When we were at Swart Building we were sent back to Verwoerd Building, so we spent the whole day moving from one place to the other, looking where we can get this permit.  Around half past three that is then that they were looking for our IDs.  They said if we have IDs we can be allowed to enter.  It was myself and Mr Motsabi, who is a member of the African National Congress, and Mr Sakalo, who is also a member of the African National Congress, and others who have accompanied us they didn't have IDs with them.  We entered inside.  We found a doctor who was responsible for - or who is a superintendent for Oranje Hospital.  His name is Gouws, Dr Gouws.  He asked us as to where do we come from.  We said we come from Botshabelo.  Then he asked us why people look for permits to enter this hospital.  Then he said, \"Where is the father?\"  Then I said, \"I am the father.  Then he told us it was for the first time he heard that people are requested permits to enter the hospital.  He sent us to the other person.  That person sent us back to Dr Gouws again.  Then he said he doesn't know anything about the incident, about the special permit.  Then Dr Gouws wrote us a letter that we should be allowed to enter the following day.  Tomorrow when we went to that hospital we found the police at the gate where security stand.  When we produced that letter then they said only the father to the child is allowed to enter, but others are not allowed to enter.  Then the following day a certain taxi driver took us to another gate where we would go in, and when we arrived where the corpse was kept the police said to us we should not tell people anything, we should just go there.  When we arrived there and asked the nurses the nurses just said, \"He has just hanged himself in the toilet.\"  Then we said, \"Where?\" but they didn't point us where he hanged himself.  Because the situation was tense we had to leave then.  We were sent to State Mortuary, where we found Sergeant Makiba.  When we asked Sergeant Makiba where he has found his corpse he said he has found the body at the Oranje Hospital.  Then we asked him where, what does he want here, then he said this is where we should put him because he is in the hands of the police.  It may happen that he has hanged himself.  We asked Makiba does he have the knowledge of the incident.  He said no.  Because he told us at times these comrades, if they see that the situation is bad, they hang themselves.  Then I requested to see him.  They made us to stand outside.  They were only able to show us just on the neck, on the head, and then you could see that he had some scars.  They only showed him only on the face.  Then I told them that I want to see the  /whole body",

They said I should go and look for a doctor and then I should come back with a doctor.  We went back to look for a doctor.  We came the following day.  When we arrived with a doctor the doctor didn't go with us, he just alighted the car and get a different direction.  And when he came back when we were in Sergeant Makiba's office then the doctor just informed us that he has seen him, he has hanged himself.  Then we questioned the doctor how, because he accompanied us, and he is the one who should accompany us to the corpse so as we should tell him, \"This is the person we want you to see.\"  He just said,\"He hanged himself,\" and then said, \"There is nothing I can do,\" then he left.  And then we see this thing is disturbing us.  Then they said, \"If you are still doubtful we will take you to the hall and then we will show you the legs, that you should just come a little bit closer and look closely and see as to whether that's your real son.\"  He was still covered with that white cloth.  Then I said to them why don't they uncover the body and be left only with the trouser or the underwear.  Then they told me that that is not the procedure.  Then Comrade Motsabi and Comrade Sakalo said that because I only see the face and the legs we should just leave everything, we will fight for it later, that I should only sign that he is the one and then I should leave many issues, because we were able to see that they  are afraid of something.  Then I signed.  Then on the 5th of January then we buried him.  Before we buried him we took him to the mortuary.  When I went back to see him I was able to see him.  He was chopped in front and at the back.  I showed the comrades who went with him that this person, how is he cut, these people were removing something?  He was cut open, and then he is bleeding.  Maybe this person has been shot or something.  That was the time when we were preparing for his funeral.  Then they said we have no time to go back as we have already signed.  That's the thing they were running away from.  We buried him.  We buried him on the 5th of January 1991.  After that they sent me a letter for an inquest in Bloemfontein.  I didn't go to Bloemfontein ... (inaudible) ... the notice of the inquest to the offices of the ANC that they have sent me a notice of the inquest.  They took that inquest and sent it to the lawyer, Venter, who was working at Cooper & Sons.

And then again if the Truth Commission can help us, that maybe if God may help -if God may take me from this world my son's child would be with me, because people are fighting against us and then we are losing our children, though we don't want to lose them.  This police who is called Mr Motogelwa, who has arrested my son, is the one which I am requesting that if the Truth Commission may help he may tell us all about what has happened to him.  If we hear things from other people he was taken to Bloemfontein already dead.  When - the child has been killed in Botshabelo and taken to Bloemfontein dead, but this Mr Motogelwa would - because people said they have seen a corpse of a boy in the van.

The other reason was that even though they claimed that the police should be independent, and they should not be aligned to a political party's ideologies, I felt pain in one instance when Mrs Maseko, whose son disappeared, who was shot at the head by Mr Madlovo.  I was - I didn't want to give false evidence, but I had to give false evidence because I was afraid.  Those were some of the reasons which made me to leave the police.

            "  I am happy, Sir.  When I was arrested for this inciting the riot I was in Lesotho.  I was not working, but selling vegetables.  I was staying with my first wife.  We were renting at Mrs Sina's house at Moyameng.  It was during the day.  We were at a place called Hamarundi.  I was selling then.  I was - I think it's a party.  I was drinking there at that party, and then in the afternoon I went back home.  When I left there I was a little bit drunk.  It was in the midnight when I woke up.  I was arrested and my wife was not present.  That is then I was arrested and put in gaol, and then I spent two months in detention.  My wife was moved to the police station and I was not allowed to see her, except once when she was at the charge office.  We had a child who was four years old. Now, how did it then come about that you were then deported to South Africa?   ---   What happened is that previously I didn't know the laws which governed the movement between two countries, because pass laws were introduced in 1963.  I was paying my tax at my uncle in Waterval in Lesotho.  I used to pay my tax there.  When I was in Lesotho I continued paying my tax there.  That is then that when I was arrested.  They found that my passport has expired.  I was only able to come and renew my passport in Ladybrand.  But van der Walt, I showed him in many instances, but I didn't tell him of my problems, and I didn't even show him my tax number.  He just thought that it is important for me to be deported back to South Africa, that I was not supposed to be there.  I was forced to come back to South Africa.",

And then he said to me I should return home.  Even if I tried to explain to him that I have children in Lesotho, but he said to me I should come back to Lesotho.  He didn't even advise me to extend the dates for the passport pending my request which I was just to make, which is my second point.

He said I should go and meet the detectives first.  I went to the detectives.  When I arrived there they communicated with me well.  They gave me newspapers, they put me aside, then they monitored which pages I was reading on the newspapers.  I pretended as if I had interest in the sports pages.  So I sat there the whole day.  At last at dusk I was told to leave.  Then I asked them how - I did explain my situation that my passport has expired, and then again I have children in Lesotho just to leave, and I am here at Ladybrand.  Where should I go?  I don't have a house in Ladybrand, my family is in Lesotho.  There is a certain coloured man.  I want to thank that person who has provided me with accommodation in his house.  And then the following day I returned.  My feelings guided me to go back to the Security Branch to show them my innocence, and that they should give me permission.  On the following day I had problems, because I went to that office.  On my departure I was surprised.  I was kicked, I was clapped, where even my left ear burst, then all the time I go to the doctor and my ear is full of a pus.  I was kicked, then I was assaulted.  But what I remember is that the person who was assaulting me - Nompanwe was there, who was one of the police and he is staying at Bloemfontein.  He was a member of the Security Branch.  I ran to the charge office.  There is a section of the Security Branch and the uniformed police station.  The person who helped me at the charge office is a certain white person who was dressing in a grey suit.  He just said to them, \"This person looks innocent,\" because this CID was always following me.  But this policeman said, \"This person looks innocent.  It might be possible that he is telling the truth that he is legally married and he has children.\"  That is then that they said to me that I should go to the commissioner's office.  Then they prepared papers for me, they took me to the bridge at the border gate.  But my ear was not well ... (inaudible - end of Side B, Tape 1, beginning of Side A, Tape 3) ... period of 1971.  ",

            "  Maybe you are right.  You know, my problem is I was a shepherd, I cannot write, and I forget all these days, but I still - can I repeat what I just said earlier on about the harassment?  Now, listen very carefully because I am telling you the story now.  On that day it was at night of the date you have referred to.  A person arrived and he knocked.  When I answered the door burst open, and I said, \"Who is knocking so terribly?\"  He answered, he said, \"Police,\" and I said, \"What police are knocking on my door in this way?\"  He forced his way through with many policemen.  The door was already down.  Three policemen were black and the rest were white, and they referred to us as kaffirs.  Many of them were whites.  They were together with big dogs, two in number.  They said every door of the house should be opened.  They pulled clothes from the wardrobes.  I said, \"When a jackal gets into the sheep it does not do this.  Please unpack neatly and pack them back neatly.\"  They did not provide an answer, they pushed us outside.  I fell on my shoulder.  I asked them, I said, \"What do you want?\", but they never provided an answer.  They pushed us outside.  It was terribly cold on that day.  The children were woken up.  I said to them, \"Will you provide me with the money to take these children to the doctor?\"  They did not answer.  I said to them, \"Please, the policemen are not supposed to behave in this way.\"  I said, \"When a policeman goes to a farm he starts first at the farmer's house.  If the farmer doesn't allow them entry they leave.  Now, where do you get the permission from to get into my premise, break the doors?\"  Is this the way you conduct your affairs?\"  When I looked thoroughly the door was not just kicked, it was even broken down with the gun butts.  Even to this day the doors are still broken, that my children took pity on me and in this year March they bought a new door and the new frame, and we had to get another person to come and fix the door.  This was the kind of harassment I went through.  At sunrise life began to be easy.  They wanted to cut open the wardrobes that were locked, and I said to them, \"How dare you cut open these doors?\"  I said to my children, \"Prepare tea.  Prepare coffee for these people.  They are hungry.\"  I asked them, \"Can I offer you beer?  Can I offer you drink?  Can I offer you boerewors?  Are you hungry?\"  I said, \"These people are hungry.  I have to provide them with food.\"  I said to them, \"You are not policemen, you are just boers.\"  One of them pushed me outside.  That is where I fell on my shoulder and injured myself.  I was not supposed to speak that way, I admit, but because I was hurt and disturbed on that day I spoke wrong words.  I said, \"I know you policemen are thieves.  You want to take us outside so that you can implicate us.  I know you are going to leave behind diamonds and dagga, and you're going to drop them behind and implicate us.\"  I said, \"You bloody policeman.\"  That's what I said on that day because I was hurt.",

I'll be very glad if you'll kill us all.\"  They were - I am sorry I - you know, it's a pity I don't have a stepladder.  I will take you to my home to investigate.  And I was asking the policemen, \"What do you want?\"  They did not provide an answer.  I told them, \"I don't have diamonds, I don't have dagga.  What do you want?\"  No answer was given.  I said to them, \"You want to leave after breaking my doors.  When are you going to come back and fix them?\"  They said,  \"APLA, we'll fix them up.\"  I asked them, \"What is APLA?\"  No answer was given.  I do not even know what APLA is.  I am expecting APLA even to day to come and fix my door.  Now, it was just about sunrise.  My son, Thomas Mufihli said, \"No, go and search in my garage.\"  They said, \"Where is the garage?\"  He said, \"Wait, I have to get a key,\" and he said, \"You must be very careful, don't just scratch my car.\"  They searched the garage and they let their dogs search.  These were fierce-looking dogs.  After searching the garage he said to them, \"You are not yet finished.  I have got another place where you can search.  That is I have a foreign(?) house.  Go and search.\"  He said, \"I have a supermarket.  Go and search it too, because you don't seem to get what you want.\"  And they left with him.  Now at sunrise they were still at home.  He asked the, \"What exactly do you want?\"  They arrested him for the whole month.  His business stood still, there was no income for that month.  We were not given any explanation as to what happened.  I was asking myself, \"What are these policemen doing here?\"  I was scared of their guns.  The three kaffirs were - there were only three kaffirs, just like myself, and the rest were white.  They had many vans.  The vans were lining the whole street.

During that time it was known as Jacaranda Bus Service.  I was a driver, and again I was the chairperson of the stewards under South African Allied Workers Union.  It happened that more than 10 workers were retrenched on the 27th of September.  Because I was the leader of the workers we decided to stop working until those retrenched are re-employed.  It happened that they were re-employed on the 28th.  On the 29th in the morning I took my wife.  She was expectant, expecting our second child.  I took her to Pelonomi Hospital.  I arrived late, around quarter to one.  I was supposed that at 1 o'clock I should start working.  When I arrived I received message that one of our workers has been detained by the police, and that person was Moses Mhlapo.  I called all the workers.  Whilst we were still talking about this issue, how can we engage management in this issue, we took a decision that the following day we will meet our employer.  What happened at 1 o'clock when I was supposed to start working, when I arrived in the office when I was supposed to sign, they said I am not supposed to sign.  My employer said I should not go on duty.  I waited until half past three.  At 3 o'clock I see three kombis which belong to the South African Police, and they were in private uniform.  We were just relaxing as a group.  Those police were well armed, and we see that they were fighting.  One of the managers appeared, who is Mr Viljoen.  He pointed me among all the group.  These people didn't say anything to us, they just came to us with guns.  That person just pointed me.  The workers wanted to fight that I should not be arrested.  To see that these police would shoot I restrained the workers that they should leave these police to arrest me.  I was arrested and they took me to the office right inside the depot of Mr van Rensburg.  When I entered the office a certain white policeman - his surname was Jacobs.  He was accompanied by Mr van Rensburg, who was a policeman.  He hit me with an open hand.  He pushed me on the table.  While I was still looking at the depot manager to intervene he telephoned the head office of IBL.  He spoke to Mr Erasmus, who was the director of the company.  What they were talking about I don't know, but I was only to catch the last phrase, which said, \"Let him be brought here.\"  The police took me.  We followed each other.  Whilst on the road other cars were taking another direction, but the kombi took us to another direction.  This Jacobs asked me which language do I speak.  Then I told him that I am speaking Xhosa.  Then he said, \"You Xhosas, you are the ones who are looking for this land.\"  Then I didn't answer him.  When we arrived there one of them alighted and he went inside, and when he returned Jacobs said Mr Erasmus said he doesn't want even to see me, which they should take me.  That is where I was taken care of.",

            "  He was the managing director.  They took me to Park Road Police Station.  They took my belt and the shoe laces, then I was put in a cell.  I didn't know what was happening.  When I entered the cell I found Mhlapo there, being alone.  We started to discuss.  Then he told me where he was found.  Then I told him that they found me at a certain place.  Whilst we were still there they - it was in the evening and we didn't know what was happening, and in the morning the Security Branch picked me up to their headquarters in Fountain Street.  When I arrived there they put me there, but they were not talking to us.  Around 9 o'clock a certain man whose rank then was the warrant-officer - I just forgot the surname.  He holds Mhlapo with his moustache.  He said to him, \"You, Mfazwe.\"  The other ones reprimanded him and say, \"That's not the one.\"  He looked at me and say, \"I thought you are a cannibal.\"  Then he went outside.  Then Jacobs entered.  He picked me up from that cell whilst I was still with Mhlapo, he took me to his office.  Whether it was his office or not I don't know.  He took me a photo.  He made me to stand against the wall and took me a photo or photos, then from there he said to me I should tell him the truth what I am doing at work.  Whilst I was still listening to him he said to me I should tell him the truth what the ANC is teaching us to do.  During that time I didn't know anything about the ANC, I knew about UDF.  I said to him, \"You must ask me about UDF, not ANC, because I don't know anything about ANC.\"  That is when he started to beat me.  He tied my thumb and tied it with my leg and he installed the electric wires and shocked me, and then I began to be numb on my right side and on my lower part of the left side, because maybe according to him I was not responding the way he liked.  He tied my two hands between my legs.  He put two chains(?), then put a stick and performed a helicopter method so that I should linger around, and that made me hurt on my shoulders and on my lower limbs.  Maybe he felt that I am not feeling anything.  He released me there.  He brought a tyre tube which was cut.  He was together with a black man then.  This black policeman he tied that tube on my nose and my mouth and then tied it so that I should not be able to inhale and exhale.  During that time I became - the whole body became numb.  From there I don't know what happened.  I regained conscious when he hit me with an elbow.  I only saw when he hit me with his elbow on my back, then I fell on the ground again.  The other one reprimanded him and say I should be left alone.  I heard that noise, then I was taken back to where Mhlapo was.  A certain black policeman arrived and took me and made me - they took my fingerprints.  Then they asked me as to whether do I know where I am going.  I was informed that I was arrested under emergency regulations.  They took me to Grootvlei Prison, and that is where I was detained.  After spending a day at Grootvlei Prison the Jacaranda or IBL management arrived.  There were three of them.  That's Mr Joubert, Mr Basson and Mr Ferreira.  Mr Joubert read me a letter which notified me that they have terminated my employment because I didn't come to court, and again I didn't come to work.  What about - I didn't know anything about the case, and that letter explains again that they give me three days to lodge an appeal, and then if I don't lodge an appeal against that expulsion they know that I have forfeited everything.  Because of anger I was frustrated, and then they left.  After four days that is when I felt pains.  My body was beginning to get swollen.  I didn't get any medical treatment at all.  I tried to meet the doctor in prison.  I think on the 16th of that month, that is October, that is when my lawyer arrived.  That is Advocate Dita Galegi(?).  We explained to him what happened and the kind of torture, and that I was not allowed to see the doctor, and then again I was not allowed even to have medical treatment.  On the 26th of that month, which is October - on the 26th of November Jacobs and others arrived to take me to Pelonomi Hospital.  When I arrived there the doctors examined me and then they said I should undergo operation the following day.  On the 27th I went back to Pelonomi Hospital.  I requested one of the policemen so that I should telephone home so that I should notify my wife.  My second child was born on the 1st of November.  I didn't even know that I had a baby.  I only saw when they arrived with her on the 27th before I underwent an operation.  I underwent the operation and returned.  I had a problem at the back.  I asked the doctor before he made an operation, then he said if they don't see anything then they will notify me later.  Then they said they have removed - they removed bad blood, or some lumps in the body.  Then they said I should stay in the hospital.  They notified me that the Security Branch said I should go back to prison.  The doctor arranged for a discharge from hospital to go to prison.  For the second time when I arrived in prison - and it's Jacobs who took me back to prison - they gave me extra blankets so that I should sleep comfortably.  When I separated with Jacobs on that day he asked me what is my problem, but I said to him, \"The problem I have, you are the cause of it.\"  Then I said to him again that that was the end when you beat a black person.  After he left me in prison when he entered the road the truck - they collided with a truck.  Then this Jacobs was injured.  He's now confined to a wheelchair.  Even now he is confined to a wheelchair.  That is the first part of what happened to me.  I was released the following year on the 1st of April after I completed six months in detention.  When I was released I couldn't go back to work.  The trade union decided that I should be an organiser of that trade union.  The case continued, and the person who was handling that case is Galegi.  I was defeated for the appeal to go back to work because the period has expired.  He tried to find all the documents at Pelonomi Hospital and then he continued with the case until I was detained again for a second time in 1988, when I was taken back to Grootvlei Prison.  I was just taken, there was no question or information.  They just say the Minister of Law and Order, who is Adrian Vlok, instructed them that I should be taken back to prison shortly.  The unrest had just begun in Botshabelo about the incorporation of Botshabelo to Qwa Qwa homeland, and we as the youth were against that incorporation.  Many things happened there in terms of conflicts.  Then I was then informed that Adrian Vlok had instructed that I should go back to prison.  That's in 1988.  I was told Mr Galegi has died.  This was very surprising because Galegi was the only person in charge of the comrades.  I request the TRC to investigate this issue, because we once tried to talk to his wife but we were not successful.  His wife was a Dr Hlongwane.  After his funeral there were problems.  We didn't have any lawyer to attend to us.  On the 28th of December in 1988 we took a decision while in detention.  While in detention we took a decision to embark on a hunger strike.  We demanded our release.  This hunger strike was referred ... (intervention) ",

            "  Those who I was detained with.  Our decision was to start a hunger strike.  We were 16 in all.  We started on the 24th, and after seven days the comrades requested us to withdraw the hunger strike.  I was left on my own.  I said no more turning back.  In our cells we wrote on the walls, \"Release or death.\"  Now, all the comrades having withdrawn themselves - at that time there were already MK comrades who were sentenced.  According to the prison law we were not supposed to mix with such people.   I was now on the eighth day of my hunger strike, and one of the already-sentenced members of the MK came to me.  He came to convince me to withdraw from then hunger strike.  I was opposed to his idea.  I said to him, \"It's so funny that you come here today to convince me.\"  He said to me, \"No, I asked permission to come and see you.\"  On the ninth day I was vomiting blood.  They then took a decision to take me to Pelonomi Hospital.  When I arrived at the hospital the doctors put a pipe in my stomach, checking what was going on, and they informed me to withdraw that action because I had already developed ulcers.  I refused, I carried on with the hunger strike.  I was alone, all my visits were cancelled, nobody was allowed entry.  I remember it was on the 9th, but I just happened to forget the day.  It was the 9th of January 1989.  The head of the Security Branch, Lieutenant Coetzee, and others arrived with the doctor, and the prison doctor said he was not going to examine me at all, he was not going to attend to me at all.  They decided to take me again to Pelonomi.  I do not know what were they checking because I was weak.  I felt a needle between my fingers, and after that I was strong, but I did not show them that I was strong, I pretended to be in that position of weakness.  And the same evening they gave me a fax that they sent to Mr Vlok requesting my release.  On the 17th I was informed that I was going to be released because I had already withdrew from the hunger strike and I started eating.  What happened was on the 20th in the morning I was told to pack my belongings and leave.  When I arrived in their offices I was given a form to sign.  They said I will only be released provided I sign the form, and that was a restriction form, I was restricted.  And I refused to sign that form.  I totally refused.  I said, \"You had better take me back to the cell,\" until the prison manager referred me to the offices of the Security Branch to give me an explanation.  I left the prison without signing that document.  When I arrived the two comrades who had been released before me - the other one is Carlo Letsabi, he's a selector, and the other one is Comrade Motsabi - they signed that restriction.  Now, realising that they had already signed the document I was forced to sign, and this restriction did not allow me any movement.  I was allowed to leave my house at 5 o'clock in the morning, and 6 o'clock in the evening I should be back.  And between those hours I should have reported to the police station.  And every night at 9 o'clock the police came to my house to check on me.  I have already mentioned the issue of incorporation of Botshabelo to Qwa Qwa.  That was a very terrible time.  Dikwankwetla Party had formed a vigilante group called the reserves.  These people were using axes and spears.  They were attacking the comrades.  Now, when every car went into the yard as they were checking me I did not know whether it was the policemen or their hit squads, because I was arrested in my house.  Now, in that same year as the year was progressing MDM, the Mass Democratic Movement, took a decision that all the restricted people countrywide should defy those restrictions.  If I am not mistaken it was on the 27th of August in 1989.  Everybody who was restricted defied that restriction.  Myself and other comrades, like Trevor Manuel, Segayo, except the stalwarts.  The stalwarts defied the restrictions and the youth were involved in this action.  The MDM, through the SACC, helped them with cars.  They provided the men with cars so that they could not be found.  On the 37th day of my running away I took a decision to hand myself in.  I was at Qwa Qwa, I remember.  That was when I met Dikwankwetla, and some of the members of Botshabelo were in Qwa Qwa.  I was chased away like a dog until I survived in Bethlehem.  When I arrived in Botshabelo everywhere I stopped to get food the police were there, and I had to be on the run again.  I went to Smithfield to spend some time there.  Because I was already in the run for a long time I decided to give myself in.  As all these things were happening my family was affected, because my wife left me, she went to her parents.  I went to see them and I gave them the few rands that I had in ... (inaudible - end of Side A, Tape 4) ... at the office where I am working.  One issue that contributed to myself giving myself in was that we had permits that we applied for, and I had to apply twice a week, and this permit was issued when they felt it was necessary for them to keep me, and if it wasn't necessary they would not provide me with a permit.  Now, the members of my organisation were aware now that the police are not - they said they are aware that I don't want to work any more, I was not now on the run.  That is when I decided to give myself in.  The police came in large numbers with the South African Defence Force, and they picked me, they took me to Park Road Police Station.  When I arrived there the Park Road Police did not allow me in their premises.  I was then taken to Botshabelo.  Now, the police in Botshabelo said they will accept me.  I appeared before the Court on Monday and I was charged with 41 counts.  Now the problem was to find a lawyer for myself.  They borrowed me their telephone so that I can inform my office.  I did inform the office, and after that they came to me, they said that head office found me a lawyer.  When this lawyer arrived he said he was given a mandate to negotiate on my behalf the bail, and the bail was R500,00.  The week after the bail day I was supposed to appear before Court.  This lawyer was June Oosthuizen.  He was working for Webbers.  And the lawyer informed me to plead guilty.  That was after submitting my statement of being on the run, and the lawyer said I should plead guilty.  I refused, but not to June.  When I appeared before the Court I was told to plead guilty or not, and the lawyer stood up and said I am guilty.  I jumped and I said, \"No ways.  I am not guilty.  You are no more my representative.\"  I told him there and then.  Now, the decision taken by the Court was that my bail should be withdrawn because there was a piece of paper saying I did not follow the proper channels of bail.  At a certain time the police went to my house to check me and I was not at home, and that's how the bail was withdrawn.  I was taken back to prison, and that was the start of the trial.  I spent three months and I did not have any lawyer to represent me so that I could be given bail, until I transport the message with one of the prison warders, Mr Tsokolo.  He was in a position to call Ismael Ayob's firm to come and negotiate bail on my behalf.  Advocate Hussain was able to negotiate a bail on my behalf and I was given a R1 000,00 bail.

            "  I was actually coming to that issue.  I will jump then and go to the incident that took place in 1990.  Now, there were two factions in Botshabelo at that time, because in 1989, that was the end of December, a strike began.  That was a strike at IBL, and the issue of the incorporation of Botshabelo into Qwa Qwa was also continuing.  Because I was still under the restriction conditions, though I was released on bail, but the conditions were still applicable as they were.  On that day - if I am not mistaken it was on the 9th of March - I was the offices of IBL on that day.  I was going to take part in the expulsion of an employee.  I was driving a hired kombi from Avis.  I stopped outside the IBL offices because I had an appointment there.  Just on my arrival a lady came running to me - I was with my comrade, Zanile Janji - and she said, \"Quickly get out of this room.  There are people coming to attack you.\"  It is true, when we got into the passage we peeped through the window and the kombi was on fire.  And we managed to run to the door, and just when we got outside this was a group of people attacking us.  We ran to our offices and I called Mr Erasmus.  I was phoning him to tell him about what happened on his premises, and he said, \"Listen here, you're only crying for one kombi, what about my buses who were burned in large numbers?\"  So I had to go from the office and be back in Botshabelo.  Now I used public transport for that reason.  When I arrived in Botshabelo time had already gone because the kombi was burning, and a group of young people passed, and they passed at my home, and those said to me, \"Comrade, we are in action.  Join us.\"  Now, when we went along with the action I stopped them and I said, \"Listen here, I want small children to go back,\" but they were adamant.  Then we proceeded.  This was called \"ndodapandle\", in other words, \"all men outside.\"  This was happening because there were two enemies within the township, the hit squad from Dikwankwetla, the hit squad from IBL, and the policemen.  Now, the ones who were attacking were the IBL hit squads, because when we approached we wanted to go to them, they were already on their way, driven by the policemen.  They started shooting at that time, and we ran for cover until we reached my home.  It was at about half past six.  I think it was now getting dark.  When I approached my house I saw a Hippo parking at my gate, and children were assaulted.  There were some of the comrades who were guarding me every night because of the attacks that were done on me.  When I looked at this situation of these children being assaulted I went to the policemen and I said, \"What do you want?  This is my property,\" and some of them were surprised.   And their commander, who is Sergeant Modisane, he said he is the one.  That was the beginning of the fight because I was fighting, I didn't want them to take me by force into the Hippo.  I fought with these special constables until they defeated me, they threw me into the hippo.  They assaulted me from my house.  There were some of the children in the Hippo.  They were also assaulted.  We drove until at the police station.   We were taken into a separate room.  While waiting Modisane came in.  He said, \"Where's Mfazwe?\"",

            "  All right.  Okay, I will try to highlight.  What happened then, after seeing me he went out, and he came in with the special constables.  One of the special constables said, \"Where is Mfazwe?\"  Because the children were so afraid of them they pointed at me.  Then the assault started.  They assaulted me.  My eyes were swollen until I could not see.  My face was full of blood.  Now, I hit one of them with a fist.  He fell and he fainted.  They took him out, and after a few minutes I saw a white man - I heard a white man.  He asked them, \"Where is he?\"  One of the constables pointed at me, and this white man gave me just one blow and I was shaken.  I blew back.  He wanted to grab his firearm, but one member of the Special Branch came in and he said, \"What do you want from him?\"  They left.  The following day - the station commander of Botshabelo at that time was Mr Tsumela, who is today the deputy commissioner of the police.  On the day thereafter the children were arrested because of the information received at the clinic.  All those children who were shot were fetched from their homes, and their parents were convinced to lay charges against me because I mobilised the children to go and burn the buses.  Some of the parents refused, except the parents of just one child, and all the parents said, \"No, their children were not led into this action.\"  And a day after that I also requested to lay charges.  The person who was supposed to carry on with my statement was Sergeant Gayile.  He advised me to drop off the charges because by doing so I will not leave the police station.  Now, for my life to be safe he was asking me - he did not order me, he was just pleading with me, and I listened to him.  I left the police station and I was taken to Bloemfontein Prison.  That was after I was taken to court and the Court refused us bail.  We were eight in number.  I was the accused No 1.  We were refused bail.  I was taken to Bloemfontein Prison.  There was no bail.",

Now, this restriction issue, in 1990 on the 15th of February Mr de Klerk said he was cancelling all the charges, but mine was not cancelled, it was only cancelled on the 2nd of April in 1990, and I was left behind in this one of shooting the children.  And it was cancelled the next year in 1991, that was in January, because the child was now telling the truth that the police forced him to make a statement against me.

I think he can also be a witness to this effect, that the doctor mentioned that he doesn't want to affect his profession.  He just examined me and gave me medication, and a file was not even opened in my name.  I still have a problem with my eyes, and I have developed ulcers.  The ulcers developed during the hunger strike, and it was discovered that I have ulcers.  I even stole one of the documents at the clinic to show that I am still undergoing treatment.  These are the two things that trouble me a lot.  I have been assaulted several times.  The Mangope people also assaulted me.  I never opened a case against the Mangope people because it was a separate government, and I was just happy that they released me.  But they released me after heavily assaulting me, and when I arrived at home I did not lay charges against them.  Now, this whole thing affected my parents, especially my mother.  She passed away in 1993.  She was against me being involved in politics.  Mr Likotsi has alluded to the fact that we did not inform our parents.  It is true, because our parents were members of Dikwankwetla.  Now, everything that we were doing they saw it as being done against the government.  She was affected, and my first-born was also affected.  My marriage was also destroyed because of these problems.  Sometimes I am in prison, and my wife turned into an alcoholic.  She was now a jealous person, and in 1990 she took a decision that we should separate.  I was a single father now, raising the children, and I decided to remarry, and I am happy that I am still a married man and I have a family.  That's what makes me happy, although I am not working.  I am expecting my child in October.  Now, these are the problems that I have, and I think this has affected me.  Because of my involvement I could bear the pain.  This is briefly my story.  I request the Commission to investigate the IBL issue.  It was collaborating with the National Party Government.  They were provided with weapons.  There was a well-known hit squad, a notorious hit squad, and police could not arrest them.  Special people were employed to service in these hit squads.  Dikwankwetla also had its own hit squad.  The third issue that I would like the Commission to investigate is that Mr Tsumela, the deputy-commissioner, was the station commander at that time.  He has a lot of information.  Many people died, and the members of their families were forced to bury them without revealing anything.  Such issues ended up nowhere.  He is now the commissioner of the Free State.  He should come out clear.  He should tell the truth in all these things.  I thank you.",

            "  The political situation was not normal.  In February of 1985 the students at Mopateng High School said the white teachers should resign because they could not teach other lessons.  The headmaster was Mr Meyer, the deputy-headmaster was Norwood.  The children in the school started with the unrest.  They cut the alarms and they cut the telephone wires, and they stoned the school building because the white teachers refused to leave the school.  The vice-headmaster, Mr Norwood, shot a schoolgirl on the leg and the other students took the injured one and sent her to the doctor.  The violence was now heavy.  The police from Odendaalsrus and the police from Welkom were called in to assist.  The children ran for cover.  They were all around the township.  Some had petrol bombs, burning the police houses.  The police, on the other hand, did not just watch, they were retaliating by shooting them with the rubber bullets.  Elliot is one of the people who ran to the riverside with others.  In February the violence was still high, and on the 25th of March it was in the afternoon and it was alleged that they burnt a bus that was transporting people from town into the township.  It was in the afternoon.  And I said to Elliot, \"Please do not go anywhere.  It is alleged that a bus is burning.\"  The sun went down and we went into our houses.  In the middle of the night I heard people knocking and I asked, \"Who are you?\"  And they said, \"We are the police.  Open up,\" and I opened the door.  They came in and they said, \"Where is Marumo?\"  That is Elliot.  I said to them, \"He is present, but he is asleep.\"  They said, \"Where?\"  I showed them the room where he was sleeping in.  I went together with them.  I asked them, \"What has he done?\"  They said, \"Come, you will hear.\"  When they got into that bedroom where he was sleeping they switched on the light.  He was sleeping just like this.  They were many in number, many policemen.  They were in their uniforms.  They had batons, they had sjamboks, black in colour, and they had their firearms.  They pulled off the blanket, they threw it away.  I asked them once more, \"What has he done?\"  They said to me, \"You'll only hear tomorrow.\"  They said, \"Stand up.  Get dressed.\"  He just laughed.  He stood up and he dressed.  I said to them, \"Can he please put on his shoes?\" and he did put on his shoes.  They did not allow him to take even his jacket.  They went away with him.  They were driving in a Hippo.  The next day I went to them, I went to the police station.  When I arrived at the police station they said to me, \"He is present here, he is in the cells.\"  I said, \"Can I please see him?\"  I never saw him.  I went back home.  That was after I have given them his food.  The next day I went back to the police station.  His brother called Michael went to see him at the police station after he knocked off from work.  They allowed him to see him.  On the third day they took all the detainees, they drove them in a van and they took them to Transvaal, Bouwgroep Prison.  And we were told about their court case.  We were fetched from our homes and they were taken to court.  While they were in the court the detainees said they suspected that Elliot was sick, and his brother said the police must take him to the doctor.  I went to see him the next day and I asked whether did they take him to the doctor.  They said they did not take him to the doctor.  When I called him I met him and he did not have anything to say to me.  He didn't even know the reason behind his arrest.  The parents of the other detained children went to look for the lawyers from Johannesburg, and those children spent three months in prison.  That is at Bouwgroep.  When they came for the trial their legal representatives wanted to see them, and they were allowed to see them.  On the day of the trial the lawyers came late.  One of the detainees requested the Court to call Johannesburg, and the information was that the lawyers are on their way, and it is true they arrived.  And Elliot was together with the rest of the detainees.  When the case went to court the last time the lawyers were speaking on their behalf.  It was said that they have been discharged.  I had an opportunity to meet a prison warder from Bouwgroep Prison, and he said to me, \"Mrs Mokhothu, if it was possible you would apply bail on behalf of these children because the conditions in prison are not good at all.\"  And I said to him, \"No, we do not have money.\"  It is just a pity because this policeman was involved in an accident and he died.  When Elliot was released he was not the Elliot I knew.  He was mentally disturbed.  He was insane.  He was laughing all by himself.  He would sit wherever he likes.  That is my problem with regard to Elliot.  His time for schooling was lost.  I have taken him to many doctors.  I even took him to Hillbrow Hospital in Johannesburg.  When he came back he came back with a letter that we should give him these tablets, and he must carry this card all the time.  He is just a human being.  I now want to know - this boy of mine could have finished his studies.  I do not have anything left.  I tried to attend to his health.  I even went to the clinic to request money.  Every month they give him a disability grant of R430,00.  It is not enough to let him survive.",

I think you are a very brave person, and, as Mr Lyster has stated, irrespective of your difficulties you have been able to give us such a good picture of your son's condition.  It must be very painful for any parent to sit helplessly and watch the condition of her child deteriorating.  We have with us here people who work in psychiatric hospitals.  They are helping here.  I would like you to see them afterwards.  They will look at the tablets you have there and they will advise you whether there is some other or better type of help that you might need to get for your son.  We have also arranged with the Department of Health here in Free State that for all the people who were violated there should be free treatment.  Thank you very much again, Mrs Mokhothu.",

This is a sign, an indication of how united the community is here.  Thank you very much again.  We will adjourn now and meet tomorrow at 9 o'clock for our last day of hearings.
