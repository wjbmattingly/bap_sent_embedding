<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Can you please tell us about Baba Ngenzi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> Baba is a girl who was present, who was with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was this girl his friend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> Yes, it was his friend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was she his sweetheart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> She came to tell you what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> No, we did not hear from her, but we heard this news from his friend, Mzwakindla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Were they buried there in Maseru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> Yes, and we couldn't go there because we didn't have passports.  When we tried to apply for passports ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Can you please continue now?  You did not manage to get passports?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> No, we tried to apply for passports, but we couldn't get passports, but we were almost arrested by the Detectives in King William's Town.  It was myself and my brothers and my sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a> And we decided to come back home.  We were harassed all the way from King William's Town until we arrived home.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Let me assure you the funeral of these people</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>3 TC NGCIPHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>were so dignified, they were not buried like dogs by the people who buried them.  Even Tambo and Chris Hani were there so I want to assure you that it was a dignified funeral.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a> And as heroes they were buried in a respectful manner.  In other words, I want to say your hearts must not feel pain because Oliver Tambo was there, he came from Mozambique to go to that funeral although he was threatened by the South African Government, so I want to assure you that the people who were with your son, respected him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a> They buried him in a dignified manner.  I know that you might have requests that you want to make to the Commission and I know that the incident of Maseru is one of the incidents that made people to look forward, not to look back and other countries saw that this country is strong and the people of South African was strong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a> In other words I am trying to comfort you Ma'am.  You have requests here for this Commission, can you please tell us what are these requests?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> I want to know the perpetrators and I would like his remains so that they can be buried here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you want to know the Commanding Officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> And you want his remains to be reburied here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> There is one thing I want to clarify in that matter because in Lesotho they gave that land respect.  Maybe if we can negotiate, this can come through.  The Commission will try to help you out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a> Secondly you talked about a library, can you explain on that?  There is a library named after him in Somerset East,</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>4 TC NGCIPHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>in other words his dignity in Somerset is kept.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Is there any other thing you want to say Ma'am?  It seems as if you are finished Ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a> Mr Chairperson, I would like to say the Dilima family was one of the families which was strong in this country.  His blood was shed for the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a> He contributed a lot to the liberation of this country.  It goes back three generations in the family.  I just wanted to contribute this much about this lady's family, thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Mr Sandi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mrs Ngciphe, how old was your son at the time of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> He was 27 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> He was 27 years old?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> Yes, he was 27 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> When did he leave to Maseru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> He left in December 1982.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I can see that he was educated, can you please tell us about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> He was a Doctor in Adendale Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> That means that if he was not killed by the SADF in Maseru that day, you would be living a better life today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> At the time he was living here, was there any conflict between himself and the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> No, he went here to look for his cousin and he was supposed to come back that same week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did he have any children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCIPHE:</span> He has got one child and his girlfriend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>5</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Ma'am, I am not going to disrupt what Reverend Xundu have already said.  I think he was there, he was at the funeral himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a> He has tried to comfort you that you cannot cry for such heroes.  He told us about the history of your family and we could see that your boy was from the hero's family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a> He gave up his life, because if he didn't do that, today he would have been a rich man.  He was fighting for this country.  We salute you today for that although other people wouldn't like us to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a> I want to assure you that the perpetrators are coming forward, every day we find revelations and they are telling the people what they have done.  One of the things that the Commission is busy investigating is what was involved in the SADF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a> Your first request was that you wanted to know who were the perpetrators, who gave command.  Maybe some day we will be able to answer that question even without investigating because today they are coming forward and they are telling us what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a> Reverend Xundu has already said that as you have requested that his remains should be brought back to this country, we are dealing with that as a Commission but we hope that such people who were buried in countries like Lesotho, their families will come together and decide what they want to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a> Maybe some people will say that they want their people back, but they have to come together.  Today we would like to say we thank you for coming forward.  We thank you.</p>
