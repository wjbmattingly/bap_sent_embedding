            "(There is no interpretation of the Afrikaans here ,  so the typist is attempting to do it.)\n It was the 7th of July 1990 in the afternoon, my husband, my sister and I and her boy friend as well as my lady neighbour were at my home.  This lady and I then went from my house to hers which is a short distance away and we did not dally for long at her house when we returned to my house. As we were approaching the house my husband, my sister and her boyfriend and another woman were standing at the corner of the house and we entered the yard and I passed them and entered by the kitchen door.  We were not long inside when my husband and them came running into the house closing the door and windows. \n I asked what was going on and he replied that the Gawe family were attacking us. When I looked I saw a chaotic disturbance of the windows and window panes. My husband was at the front door and my brother in law at the kitchen door. We started screaming in the house and I had my four-year-old on my back, and as we were running into the compartments we saw a neighbour's son and her brother in my lounge holding a large can. I think they were still busy attempting to burn the house or something but I just saw the can.  We shouted and screamed  while this action of storming the house and breaking window panes continued for about an hour en then my husband said to me, \" Pumla I think I should run out so that these people can rather get me so that you people can get out\".\n He slipped quietly out by the front door while we ran out through the back door, through the yard and into another yard and I passed my child on to someone and ran to my in-laws and on arrival I said, \"Those ...(indistinct) are killing Frank!\".  They then went to my house and when I got half way to my house it was full of police and people. At this point they took me to hospital.\n When we got back from the hospital, I did not go directly home but stayed with my in-laws.  Then they came back with his clothing and belongings and said that he was dead.",

We want to sympathise with you on behalf of the Commission and we heard your request about the perpetrators.  It is our aim that in order for reconciliation to take place the perpetrators must come forward and tell the people what they did and we have also taken note of your request about your children because they lost their father in this way.\n When we are going to report to the President of this country, we'll mention this and he is the one who is going to decide what to do with your case.
