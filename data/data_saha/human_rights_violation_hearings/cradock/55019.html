<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mrs Notwala, you have made a request to talk about Sonwabo Mdekazi, who was your brother.  Is that so Mrs Notwala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Could you briefly tell us about your brother?  According to your statement he went into exile, what was he involved in politically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> In 1977 he was a student in Cradock.  He burnt down a school, he was sentenced to three years imprisonment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> He went into prison, St Albans, he was released in November, 1980.  He then went into exile in 1981.  We were never happy again at home.  The police constantly would come up.  Sometimes they would put him into a sack, this is when</p>

<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>my mother started being ill of health.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> She also went blind.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Are these the sacks that the police usually used to torture people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is this what he would tell you when he came back from prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> No, they would take him from home and put him into a sack at home and then take him to prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you know any police, the names of the police who did that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> I remember Gcali.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is Gcali still a policeman in Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> I don't know, it was here in Cradock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> When last did you hear about Gcali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> It has been a while, because he left Cradock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You said that Sonwabo left, when did he leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> He left in 1984, left Cradock in 1984.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Where was he going?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> He didn't say where he was going.  It is just the police who would come and say that they have killed him or they kept him in prison.  We didn't know exactly what was happening with him, we got different reports.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Would he write to you or phone you or anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> No, he did not contact us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you hear about his whereabouts?  Let's go back to 1987 - you say that in August, on the 5th of August 1987, what exactly happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> On the 5th of August 1987, there was a policeman from the Special Branch that came to our house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>3 N NOTWALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>He came and told us that he killed Sonwabo at the Port Elizabeth airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a> We tried to investigate, we told our brothers in Port Elizabeth.  We just accepted that report that he had been killed at the airport.  However, later we found out that he was not killed at the airport, but he was killed at Gekiza Road, at New Brighton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a> There was a case going on, and we would continue going to Port Elizabeth, but no one was convicted.  When the court case was over, the court of law declared that Sonwabo was a well-trained terrorist and therefor no one can be convicted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you ascertain who it is who came and gave the report that he had killed Sonwabo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> No, we did not.  These people never identified themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> When you would go to the court of law, did you see this police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Well, I can't say, because there were a lot of police that would come to our house and you didn't know who to take seriously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is there somebody else that was shot in Gekiza Road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> No one else was shot, but him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> The people who saw this, the witnesses, what did they say happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Nobody ever gave evidence as such.  We just got a report from court that he had been shot in Gekiza Road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You didn't even hear rumours that perhaps he had been killed a certain way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> No, because we are here in Cradock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>4 N NOTWALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you have his Death Certificate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Before I ask you what your requests are before the Commission, is that all that you have to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you have a request to the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Yes, I do.  I would like to request that the Commission gives him a tombstone and also to help my mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Where was he buried?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> He was buried here in Cradock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all you have to say Mrs Notwala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I will hand you over to Mr Chairperson, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Mrs Notwala, I just want to understand.  When Sonwabo was in exile, was he a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Yes, he was working actually for the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Was he a soldier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Well, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> You just heard that he was killed in New Brighton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> You just discovered that he was killed in New Brighton in 1987?  You didn't even know whether he is a soldier, Umkhonto We Sizwe soldier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> When he died, who told you?  Was it the ANC or the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> The police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Is it the police that told you that he had been killed by the police?  Did the ANC give you any report of his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>5 N NOTWALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> On the day of the funeral, was there an ANC speaker?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> No, there was not.  There wasn't because we were only given three hours to bury him for the funeral.  Everything was done in a rush.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> After the ANC was unbanned, did the ANC give a report that your brother was a member of Umkhonto We Sizwe and died whilst in battle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Nobody came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Who prepared for the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Headbush in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Are there leaders of the ANC where you stayed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOTWALA:</span> Well, I don't know because I was not a member of the ANC, I was not in the struggle, it was Sonwabo who was in the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> I am asking these questions, because I just need clarity on the fact that if someone dies in battle, then the organisation, be it ANC or AZAPO, then they at least show that it is their soldier that has passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a> I am not saying that is the case, but I would like to investigate, for us to investigate on exactly what happened, because we cannot depend on a police report.  There should be ownership from the organisation that he had been deployed by the ANC to Port Elizabeth.  We would like to put this in a political context.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a> If there is anything else we need to investigate, or any questions we need from you, we will come back to you.  In the mean time thank you very much for your help.  We will try to delve deeper into the matter, thank you.</p>
