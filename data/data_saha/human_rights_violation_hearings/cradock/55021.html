<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We welcome you Mrs Ntswayi, who are you with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> My son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> Xnidisi Ntswayi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is he going to give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> Yes he's going to give evidence because he was there when his brother was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I will ask Reverend Xundu to swear both of you in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">NOMAMASE NTSWAYI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">XNIDISI NTSWAYI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Mrs Nomamase, we have a statement before us here telling us how your son died.  Your story reveals that your son was in the Graaf Reinet Youth Congress, his school principal was also the mayor of the town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did the Youth Congress not approve of the election of councillors in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> I don't know, well it seems to be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Your'e saying it is so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> The town councillors were not properly elected, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Therefore the Youth Congress that was struggling for liberation saw them as impediments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What happened the day your son was killed? Please tell us briefly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> It was in the evening at about 7 o'clock.  We heard sounds, bangs, after a short while, my son, the one sitting next to me came in saying that his brother had been shot. After a few moments my house was packed with people including Mrs Kekana.  They then told me that my son died on the way to hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Was this seven in the evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> It was in summer in November so it was still light.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Were there people who saw the incident, well perhaps your son would like to fill in there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> There were people, a lot of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Perhaps your son can take over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTSWAYI:</span> It was on the 15th of November 1984.  We the youth as UDF members, as my mother said, there was a lot of toytoying at the time in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a> We then decided to go and toytoy at the mayor's house.  He got out of the house with a gun.  He thought that we were going to his house particularly to toytoy but we did not intend to toytoy at his house as such, we were toytoying along the street.  He then started shooting, we dispersed and when I asked the other comrades who had been shot, they then said my brother had been shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> So the toytoying was really a demonstration that the Youth Congress was against the town councillors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTSWAYI:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> So it was a right to protest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTSWAYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> So please proceed.  Was there ever a court case against Mr Mphepho for having shot your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTSWAYI:</span> There was no court case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Was there an inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTSWAYI:</span> No we left it as it was.  We could not do anything because if you took your case up to the boers they would just not do anything about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Therefore the police just were the law themselves, nobody would dispute anything they said, the law was in their hands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTSWAYI:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Was there a death certificate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTSWAYI:</span> Yes there was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Where is Mr Mphepho now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTSWAYI:</span> The last I heard he was in King Williamstown, a teacher. He's not in Alice, some people ran to Alice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> So he's in King Williamstown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTSWAYI:</span> Yes he is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> So there was no court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTSWAYI:</span> No there was no court case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Maybe you can hand over the mike to your mother for her to give her requests to the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> I did not hear well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What is your request to the Commission, is there something that we can perhaps do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> I want Mpepho here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You want to meet Mpepho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> Yes I would like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Secondly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> Secondly I struggle with my health.  I had no money to put up a tombstone, I need a tombstone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> How old was your son, did he have a wife or child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> He was a student in Matric.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> He had no child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> No he had no child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Is there anything else you'd like to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Mr Chairperson I'll hand over the witness to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> June Crichton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MRS CHRICHTON:</span> Mrs Ntswayi, I want to ask you just one question about the funeral.  Were there restrictions at the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> It was terrible.  Some people were arrested at the very funeral.  At the graveyard the police were beating people up. Even back at home we did not sleep that night, the police would kick the doors down and they would go forcefully into the houses.  The siblings would have to go and sleep elsewhere, would have to run away because the police wanted to kill the rest of my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MRS CHRICHTON:</span> Another question for you.  Am I correct in believing that one of the restrictions were that there could be no people at the funeral who didn't come by car?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MRS CHRICHTON:</span> Who made that restriction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> It was he police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MRS CHRICHTON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTSWAYI:</span> That is what the police told us to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Nommamase, thank you that your and your son Xnidisi came before the Commission.  The picture you have given us, we are by now used to.  A lot of people were killed in the struggle for liberation.  Your son died in battle, even though it would seem that your son was shot by someone who is not a policeman, but it is clear that he used to work together with the regime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a> Perhaps it should be comforting to you that even though your son cannot come back to you, that what he fought for, what he stood for, what he gave up his life for, we now have it. You should count him as one of the heros who gave up his life for the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a> We have noted the requests that you have stated before us and we will hand them over to our President so that he can see what he can do.  We thank you, won't you please take your places?</p>
