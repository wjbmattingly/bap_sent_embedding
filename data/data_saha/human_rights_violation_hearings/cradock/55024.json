It was during the night, I was taken to prison.\n When I got to prison the police were throwing water all over us the whole night and in the morning they took us to Colesberg and they kept us there.\n In Colesberg, it was on Saturday, while we were still there, it was Sunday and we were still there and on Monday, we were still there.  On Tuesday, we were taken to the offices to be questioned.\n Dumzela was the first one to be taken there.  When he arrived there, he didn't come back to our cell.  When I was called, Velile Ramncwana, come out and they opened the door, this Detective came to take me from the cell.  When I arrived at the office, there were three Detectives there, Xhosa Detectives, and they showed me a list.\n I asked them what is on this list and they said to me Dumzela wrote on that list and I have to do the same and then I discovered that POQO was not existing according to what they were telling me.\n They were beating me and I was on the floor.  They were taking face bricks, five face bricks on each side and they gave me two face bricks and I took them, I stood up and they were too heavy for me and I dropped them.\n They beat me after that, they tortured me.  At about half past three in the afternoon, they released me, they took me back to the cell.  When I arrived at the cell, I slept and my ears were bleeding.  I slept with one side and others were also taken out one by one and they transferred me to Norpoort.\n When I arrived at Norpoort, it was six of us and they put us in the cell, a black cell.  At that cell, they did not open the door, flies were all over the place, they did not give us any water there.\n On Wednesday, one police lorry came and we were transferred to Cradock.  We asked them where are you taking us, they said we are taking you to a place where you've never been.\n They took us to Cradock to an old prison.  We used to go to the office to be questioned there.",

Thank you for reminding us about the 1960's and for reminding us about the activities of POQO, although you are denying that you were a member of POQO.\n I know that our people suffered a lot.  As a result now they cannot differentiate or they cannot know where to deny or to accept responsibility, but all of us, those who know the history of this country, we remember the activities of POQO in this country - to keep the light when the times were dark in this country.\n Many people were arrested at that time as you were telling us your story.  Thank you for reminding us about that time.  Many people who are active today, they started being active during the 1990's when things were getting better.\n They started to be involved.  We thank you for reminding us that there are people who were active in those dark days when things were very bad.  When there was no hope for life and we salute these people as heroes of our country, because it is easy to be active when things are better, it is very hard to be active when days are dark and things are very difficult, when we are only dreaming of liberation.\n We thank you for reminding us about that time.  There are questions that we will make a follow up about in your story, together with the 56 people, if they are still alive.  For now, we thank you and we promise that we will follow your story, thank you.",
