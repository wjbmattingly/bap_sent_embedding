Siphithiphithi then walked out of the house also to go and see what was happening.  After we'd walked out we heard a gunshot.  When Henry Qatana also went out to see what was happening we discovered that Siphithiphithi had already been shot and had actually already passed away.\n When Henry Qatana tried to lift him up to bring him inside we heard a voice asking where we are taking him and ordered us to leave him, whereupon someone shot Henry in the head.  I also got out to see what was happening and as I was walking towards the kitchen I got shot in the hand.\n The ambulance then arrived together with police and took us to the hospital.",

Five of our friends were there already because we were toytoying in the street.
