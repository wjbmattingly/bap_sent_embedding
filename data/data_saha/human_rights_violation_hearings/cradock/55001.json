We thank you for your presence in this hearing and we thank you for accompanying the people who will be testifying in front of the Commission.\n We are now going to start - the time is quarter past nine.

            "We thank Reverend Vena.  We greet the people of Cradock.  We thank the Lord that He kept us until we got to Cradock, the place that we know.\n I think all the South Africans know this place, of its\nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2\ncontribution.  The great contribution that it made in the struggle of liberation in our country.\n If we mention the places that brought the leaders of the struggle of liberation, we usually mention Cradock as one of those places because it had a remarkable contribution.\n It had that spirit that was so amazing in fighting for our freedom in our country.  When we arrived here in Cradock, some of us were involved in the struggle, they get the spirit because they came to the root of the struggle.  As the Commission was planning its work at the beginning of last year, when it concluded where to start, there was an idea that the first hearing should sit in Cradock, but because of other regions, because we wanted the first hearing to show our region Eastern Cape, as a whole, we had to take different cases from different people of different nations and different organisations.\n We concluded that the first hearing should be in East London, but I would like to tell you that Cradock was among the places that we thought about first.\n We thank you that you are here today when we are towards the end of our work as the Commission.  In this hearing we are going to talk about the incidents from Cradock and the other towns.  We have tried to mix the incidents of Cradock and Somerset and the other neighbouring towns.\n I want to welcome therefor all the people who are here especially the 15 people who will be testifying in front of this Commission.  I would like to welcome Reverend Henry Maqroa, who is from the Anglican Church, who is here with us.\nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3\n I would like to welcome also the visitors from the United States of America that are here with us today.  I would request them to stand up as I would be calling their names.  That is Vincent Warren, Shanna Judge.  There is Mora Lee, and Annemarie Cillie, Gene Mackalhan and Flemming Hoffman.  These are the visitors who are here from the United States.  \n They are here in South Africa.  Last week they were in the Gauteng hearings, this week they will be here with us for the three days here in Cradock.  We would like to thank them, they have been here with us, admitting that the struggle of liberating this country, got support from different countries.\n The countries who were us while we were in pain.  We thank this opportunity of reconciliation and they are here with us today.  \n Lastly I would like to introduce, just before we start with the hearing.  I would like to tell the people that we have got a lot of statements coming from the neighbouring towns that we will be dealing with in this three day hearing here in Cradock.  We have something like 124 different cases.\n Unfortunately we cannot take all this statements to the hearing, because if we will try to take all of them, we can take three to four weeks sitting here in Cradock, listening to those cases.\n Because of that, we had to restructure again and take a few cases.  I want to make it clear to the people that the statements that are not brought forward to the hearing, that does not necessarily mean that the Commission is ignoring them or maybe such statements are not as important as the \nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n4\nother statements. \n Because of the limited time that we have, we can take only a few statements.  The statements that are not brought forward to the Commission, the Commission is dealing with them the same as the other statements, in other words, our investigative unit is going to investigate those cases.  The Committee of the Human Rights Violations is also going to deal with those statements and make a finding.\n The Committee of Rehabilitation and Reparation is going to work with those statements.  I want to assure the people who won't be appearing in front of the Commission that their statements that are here with us, they also get the same attention as the other statements for those people who will be here, coming forward to testify.\n We will be here for three days,  it is today, tomorrow and Wednesday.  Because of the fact that today it is our first day, we have started at quarter past nine.  As from tomorrow and Wednesday, we will start exactly at nine o'clock.   We therefor request that the people should be seated at half past eight.\n We appeal to the people that they give the hearing the respect that it deserves, and the dignity that it deserves.  I am talking to the people of Cradock who know our battle, and the people who know what respect means, what kind of respect we gave to the victims of that battle.  Thank you.  For now I am going to hand over to Miss Tiny Maya, who will be telling us about the order of the day.  Thank you.",

Before we start with our hearing, it is our tradition that we have a moment of silence to remember the people that we will be talking about, the people who died.

She is now \nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n7\na member of the Committee called the Human Rights Violations.\n On my left I have Reverend Xundu.  I think the people of Cradock know him.  Most of the funerals here, he used to be there, he used to attend those funerals.  You will remember in the funeral of the Cradock four, he was participating as an Officiating Minister.

            "He was 17 years old at the time.  It was early in the morning, the White policeman came with the Councillor.  I didn't know the White policeman, I only know the Councillor who was Xolile Dosini.\n They didn't knock at the door, instead they kicked the door.  When I asked, they said open up.  Because I was just discharged from the hospital, though I was still sick, I tried to stand up to open up the door - when I opened the door, they asked me where is Rocky, I said Rocky is asleep, what's wrong?\n They said they were looking for him.  I said he was in the bedroom that was next to mine.  They went there to that \nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n9 NL JAMES\nbedroom and I followed them.  When he stood up, Dosini lit him with a torch, he said don't do that because I must first get my clothes.  He said, you are not going to tell me what to do.\n I said, you can't talk like that.  Just give my child a chance to dress up, he is not going to get out of the house, naked as if he has killed a person.  They waited for him until he finished dressing up.  When he was about to go out, he said I greet you, Mom and Dad.  \n When he went out Dosini said, we are not going to waste time about you, we are going to deal with you quickly.  They took him out, his father was preparing himself to go to work.  I went back to bed.  \n After some time another van came.  They didn't kick the door this time, they knocked.  I kept quiet, I was sitting on my bed.  I opened the curtains and I could see that there were policemen.  I kept quiet.  They said open up, I didn't respond.\n They ordered me to open the door again, I didn't respond.  They went to the door, the door was not locked because it was in the morning.  When they opened, I remembered that there was a child who was sleeping in the lounge and I went there.\n They asked me if I knew Rocky, I said yes, he is my son.  They asked where is Rocky?  I told them that the police took him.  They asked me the name of the police, I said I don't know the names of the White policeman, I only know the Councillor which is Xolile Dosini.\n They said we are coming to tell you that the police who took your son, have killed him.  They went out of the door.  After they have said that, I couldn't cry.  The only thing \nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n10 NL JAMES\nthat I did, I went out, but I am still wondering - even today - whether I was dressed up when I went to his father in town.\n The neighbours woke up because the children were crying and I was not there.  One of the neighbours who followed me and I was telling her to go back, because I didn't want to be there with anybody, I wanted to be with my God.  And I knew that she was going to disturb me and I told her that if you are accompanying me, you must keep quiet because I am still talking to my Lord.\n When I went to the garage where my husband was working, I saw him.  He was alighting from the police van, he approached me and he told me that the police brought - he asked me if the police came to my house and he also told me that they took him to where my son was, but they didn't let him to come closer to him.  They said he must just stand at a distance and confirm that it was his son.\n They took him back to work.  When we were still talking, there was another van who came to fetch him, my husband.  He gave me the money, the bus fare to go back home and I said, I don't want to take any transport, I don't want to talk to anybody, I don't want to be disturbed, because I am still communicating with my Lord and I am asking the Lord what to do.\n I decided to walk home.  When I arrived home I noticed that there were lots of people, and the teachers were there.  I told them that when the police were taking him, my son, I told them that they must first tell the teachers because he was writing exams.\n What they did, they confused his father, so that he mustn't think about what to do about his son, because each \nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n11 NL JAMES\ntime one other van is bringing him.  Each time the van brought him home, the other van would come and take him back to the police station and they forced his father so sign that he was operated, he must sign the form and then he refused to sign, because he said he was not told about the operation.  The person who made the operation, must sign.\n They told us that we are not going to get the body of my son, they are going to bury him on a Thursday.  He was going to be buried be the Government and we are not allowed to attend the funeral.  He was going to be buried by the police.\n I asked them how can that happen because we are the parents of his boy?  They said, it is the law because whatever he was doing, he was doing it, we are not supposed to be at his funeral, we are not going to attend.\n I tried, I made some attempts because I noticed that the father was still confused.  I went to seek for legal advise from Fishart, who was a legal adviser from Port Elizabeth and I wanted him to come just before the funeral.\n He came, Fishart came on a Wednesday at six o'clock, he went there, when he arrived, the District Commandant of the time asked the attorney where do you get this information, because I just arrived, I was on leave?  I didn't hear anything about that, and you are coming from Port Elizabeth, you have this kind of information?\n The attorney told him that the parents of this boy told him.  They wanted to know who informed Fishart.  Fishart said these parents have another child who is also in Port Elizabeth, who is the one who gave me, Fishart, the message.",

I think they phoned the police station because after that I saw the police vans and the police alighted from the vans, pointing guns and they surrounded me and Xolile came out of the office and I said, don't be afraid, Xolile, I am not going to do anything.
