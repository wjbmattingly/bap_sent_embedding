<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> Yes, that is so, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Can Thembinkosi Tshabe come to the stage please.  We are going to deal with these two cases as the same time.  I just realised that the people who were looking at the cases, said they were the same, so we are going to deal with them at the same time - it is Mxolisi Goboza and Thembinkosi Tshabe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a> I am going to hand over to Reverend Xundu to swear you in and thereafter I will hand over to Ntsiki Sandi to ask questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  We are going to start with Mxolisi.  Mxolisi is Goboza your surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> My surname is Ngoboza, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Mxolisi you and Thembinkosi, we noticed that in the statements that we have in front of us, you have made application to appear before the Truth Commission today so that you can tell us what happened one day in 1993 in</p>

<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>Venterstad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a> Let us start with you Mxolisi.  How old are you, Mxolisi, right now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> I am 15 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> How old were you during this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> I was 11 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Can you please tell us Mxolisi, on this day in June 1993 in Venterstad, what happened while you were with Thembinkosi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> It was during the day.  A police casper came, but nothing happened.  During the night we saw police shooting, they were shooting tear gas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a> My sister had sent me to my uncle and I went through a passage and I saw a police casper, but I didn't run away.  They shot me and I fell.  One of the children took me to the house and he called my sister and my sister came with a car and they took me to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a> The pellets were removed.  They told my sister that if I can vomit during the night, and have diarrhoea, I must be taken to the hospital.  During the night I vomited. </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a> The following day I woke up, I went back to the Doctor.  The Doctor said there is nothing that he can do because the pellets are right in my intestines.  I was transferred to Burgersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a> Even there they said there is nothing they can do.  I was transferred to Bloemfontein again for an operation.  I was admitted there for three weeks and the pellets were removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were all these pellets removed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> The hospital in Bloemfontein that you went to, is</p>

<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> Yes, it is Pendenoni Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> On this particular day, were there any events during the day that took place in Venterstad just before you were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> The people were toyi-toying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> In your statement you said this case is well known in the Advice Office of Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Who referred the matter to there?</p>

<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You said he referred this case to Mr Fish?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> No Mr Fish is from the Venterstad Advice Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> One day we were called to the court.  I don't even know whether this attorney was representing the Boers, the case was discussed and we were sent away - they said they would call us again, but that never happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> When you say you discussed, do you mean that you and Thembinkosi were involved when the case was discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> Thembinkosi was not there because he was not in the records.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were there any other people talking to you except the police?</p>

<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> It was Sis Tandiwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is Sis Tandiwe your parent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> No, she is my mother's sister.</p>

<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> With whom did you come to this place today?</p>

<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> At home, did you tell them that you were coming to the Truth Commission, or do they know that you are coming?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> Yes, they know.  I told them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all that you would like to tell us today, Mxolisi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> By appearing before this Commission, young boy, do you have any request that you would like to tell us as the Commission, can you tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> I request that the Commission should take me to school, help me with my education.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What standard are you doing now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> I am doing standard 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What would you like to be when you are educated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> I would like to be a prison warder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> I want to be a prison warder, look after the prisoners.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you have specific reasons Mxolisi, why you want to be a prison warder and watch the people who are sentenced for their actions, can you tell us about those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> It is because they are breaking the law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What do you think is the proper treatment for the people who are breaking the law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> They should not be ill-treated, they should be handled with care.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Let us come to Thembinkosi.  Thembinkosi, the way I look at this matter, this is the same case - it affects both of you.  You have been listening while Mxolisi was talking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a> Can you just add where he left out, if there is something that you think he has left out when he was telling us the story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> There is nothing much, but during the toyi-toyi it was the school children and the police failed in their work, because they prevented us from marching and in stead they called the police from Middelburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a> When the police from Middelburg arrived, it was early in the morning.  When we tried again to continue with the protest, they prevented us again.  So the students were totally against this and they went to the township where they actually attacked a Municipal van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>6 T TSHABE</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a> The following day, on a Sunday, the police came and they administered tear gas.  Late that day, though we didn't get a chance to continue with our march, they came again with tear gas, they were just shooting, but they were not assaulting anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a> They were shooting everybody, even the people who were not students, they were shot.  We were taken at the same time on that Sunday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a> We were being shot because we set the Municipal van alight and they were just shooting, killing everybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> How old were you at the time of this incident in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> I was 15 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Are you still at school now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What standard are you doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> I am doing standard 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> This toyi-toyi or protest that was taking place, what was the cause, what was the grievances of the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> The students were fighting for their rights, because the Boers took us to town while we were to increase the standard at school, because we had to increase the classes up to standard 8, we didn't have enough classes and the Boers refused when we tried to negotiate.  The Boers refused to listen to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a> That is when COSAS took over and they also burnt COSAS and the Boers from Middelburg came and said after 10 minutes, we should dismiss.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You said you were also shot, what Hospital did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> While I was shot, I couldn't go to the</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>7 T TSHABE</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>Hospital, I went with this woman who was here who was shot there and we went to the Doctor.  That was Doctor Kashent.  MR SANDI: Is he also from Venterstad?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is he still there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> No, he left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you see the police who shot at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> No, I couldn't because I wasn't expecting anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were you listening when the lady before you was testifying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> Which one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> The one who was testifying, did you see her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you hear her when she said there was no law in Venterstad?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> Yes, I heard her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> As far as you know, do you think that that is true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> The rights that we were actually fighting for, were the students' rights, but in the community, there was no commotion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What kind of treatment were the people getting from the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> They were not doing anything, in stead they used to invite police from outside.  When we went there to ask about this matter, they told us that this police from Middelburg are not under Venterstad, so they don't ask for anybody's permission, they just do whatever they would like to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a> Even if one policeman is trying to prevent them from</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>8 T TSHABE</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>doing what they were doing, they wouldn't care, they wouldn't consider, they wouldn't take care.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a> And they also told us that this police - they don't go to the police in charge and get permission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Can you also say that the police were taking the law into their own hands?  Do you also confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you.  Let us continue.  By being here today, Thembinkosi, do you have any wishes or requests that you would like to tell the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> I am here because I would like to request the Commission to help me in my studies and my ill-health.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Can you specify about health?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> Since after that time, me and one of the gentleman who were shot, when we went to the Doctor, Doctor Kashent, he said he won't give us treatment, we must go straight to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a> But because we are not politicians in Venterstad, we were told that we mustn't go to the hospital, because it might happen that the police could come to the hospital and arrest us, so we were afraid, we didn't go to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a> The comrades took us and they tried to remove the pellets, it is only three pellets now that are embedded in my body and after some time that affected me because I normally have sharp pains, I feel dizzy some times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you mean that you have pellets embedded in your body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> Yes, three of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is there any way how this whole thing affected you especially in your studies?  Was your time wasted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> Yes, it is so because as from that year I</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>9 T TSHABE</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>couldn't concentrate, I couldn't think quickly.  Especially if I am in class, sometimes I become dizzy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a> So since after the incident, I couldn't succeed with my studies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Lastly, if you say you request that you get assistance in your studies, is there any career that you would like to pursue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> What I thought about was being a nurse, I also thought of being a male nurse or a Social Worker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you mean that you would like to be a male nurse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thembinkosi, is that all that you would like to tell us about just before I hand you over to the Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> Yes, that is all for now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Mxolisi, I want to start with you.  The people who did all these things to you, what is it that you would like the Commission to do about them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR GOBOZA:</span> I would like the Commission to investigate and get them and punish these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> And you Thembinkosi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABE:</span> That is my wish also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you.  I think that is the very first time in this area in this hearings of the Eastern Cape that we are listening to the testimonies of the people of your age, more specially Mxolise who is only 15 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a> We normally listen to the elderly people, it is for the first time that we are listening to young people, a young person like Mxolisi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a> That has actually touched us.  We thank God that He has</p>

<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>10</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>protected you that you didn't die that day.  As we are looking at you, we think about a lot of children who are like you, who were not so fortunate to be alive.  Young boys and girls who never escaped like you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a> We wish you all the best in your lives.  You have seen great things at a tender age in a country where the elderly people are shooting the children.  In other countries the people say that children must be protected, given love and cared for.  In this country the elderly men are shooting the children of your age, saying that they are protecting themselves, saying that they are maintaining law and order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a> We have a wish if it is possible, that you can grow up and the careers that you would like to pursue in life, that should also happen.  In Ventersdorp, you would be the leaders, you have seen many great things at a tender age.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a> We thank you for coming to the Commission.  Your wish that you would like to see these people getting punished, we have noted it.  My wish is that those people one day should see, they should go to Ventersdorp and they should take a closer look at you and say we apologise for nearly destroying your lives.  Thank you.</p>
