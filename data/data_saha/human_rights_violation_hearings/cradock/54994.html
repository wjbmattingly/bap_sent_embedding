<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>REVD FINCA: ... after that, Ntsiki Sandi will lead you as you testify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">THANDIWE AGNESS DANO:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, she has been sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Good morning Thandiwe Agness.  Can I call you Thandiwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, you may.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you.  I noticed that in your statement you have requested to come before the Commission so that you may testify about Luyanda Dano and tell us about what happened.  How are you related to Luyanda Dano?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> He is my son, because he is my brother's son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> This incident was in 1977?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, 1977.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Could you inform us exactly what happened to Luyanda Dano in 1977?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Luyanda was a student.  There was a bit of chaos at school and he was one of the children who were active at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a> The police were looking for him as well as the other students.  He would run away from the police and he would not sleep at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a> The one evening the police came to our house and kicked down the door.  They would light torches into our eyes and </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>2 TA DANO</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>said that we must not move.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a> The one requested that I give Luyanda his clothing.  I got up to give him the clothing.  They then said to me they were just going to take him to the police station so that he could give a statement and they would bring him back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a> There were three policemen that were inside the house, the others were surrounding the house.  They left in a kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a> As I was working next to the police station, I went to find out what was going on and I found out that he had been arrested, he had been detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a> Then I was told that Luyanda was sick in prison.  I would go during my lunch time, because I wanted to find out what was going on.  I then dealt with Seki Meyers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is Lupuwana one of the police that was - was he one of the wardens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, he was one of the wardens.  I asked Seki  what happened to Luyanda, what was happening with him?  He said that he was ill and that the Doctor had to be called.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a> I asked exactly what was wrong with him, they said they didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a> I waited again, I wanted to find out what was wrong with Luyanda.  Lupuwana then said that Dr Robinson had diagnosed him as suffering from nerves, nervous tension.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a> He then had to appear in court.  Because I was working that day, I asked his mother to go to court.  He then got latches.  What we discovered however, is that he was just not beaten up, but his head had been damaged at the back and the situation was much more grave than they actually presented to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> For how many days were Luyanda detained before he</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>3 TA DANO</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>went to court?  How much time had elapsed before he appeared in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> I think it was a month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> He then was examined by Dr Robinson.  Was he working for the Government prisons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> No, he was a General Doctor, he was a District Surgeon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You were still telling us that Dr Robinson diagnosed him as suffering from nervous tension.  Could you continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, that is the report that I got that Luyanda was suffering from nervous tension.  There were no marks to show that he had latches.  When I then got home, he was there, but he was not well at all, he was deranged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a> He constantly had to go to a mental institution to be examined.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What else did you notice about him, especially about his health?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> We noticed that he was deranged.  When he came back, he was deranged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Where is Luyanda now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> He is now in Grahamstown, Fort England Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you take him to that hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, we took him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Since when has he been there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Since April last year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you go and visit him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, we do.  We went in December as well to visit him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Let's just revert back.  When Luyanda came back from jail, what was his explanation, what did he say happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> He said that he had been beaten up.  The morning that he had been detained, he had been beaten up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did he explain exactly how they went about beating him up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> He said that he was hit against the wall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Who hit him against the wall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> He mentioned a policeman called Chris.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did he mention any other policemen besides Chris?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> He did, but he didn't know the names.  He said that Chris was not the only one that was torturing him, but there were others as well that he could identify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Was there any other way that he had been beaten up besides being hit against the wall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> He said he had been beaten against he wall and the floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Before Luyanda was detained, had he been ill of health, in the sense, was he deranged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> No, he had never been deranged before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you go and visit him in the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, we do, we went in December as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is he aware that you are before the Commission today testifying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> No, I don't think so because the last time we saw him was in December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> When you go visit him, does he talk about what happened to him whilst he was in detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, he does.  One of his major gripes is that he should be at school with the others.  He says that he realises most unfortunately that the remainder of his life will be spent in a mental institution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>5 TA DANO</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Are there things that perhaps you feel that Luyanda would be expressing, should he have been here today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, there are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Could you tell us please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> I am positive that he would be giving a list of people who had beaten him up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> In your statements you make reference to a bicycle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> His mother told us that he had been accused of having stolen a bicycle.  This is what was said in the Court of Law.  (tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Was he found guilty of having stolen a bicycle in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, yes, he was found guilty because he got the latches exactly because he was found guilty of having stolen the bicycle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you have a lawyer at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> No, we did not.  His father was in detention at the time as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all you have to say to us today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Why was his father in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> His father was in the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Where is the father now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> If he is not here in this hall, then he is back at work, because he was meant to have a meeting at work, but otherwise he meant to come here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> How old is Luyanda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Now at the present time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> No, when he was beaten by the police, was he 15 years of age?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>6 TA DANO</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, he was 15.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all you have to say to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you have any requests to the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> I request that the perpetrators that led to Luyanda's being deranged, be punished for what they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Before I hand over to Mr Chairperson, I just want to ask - did you ever see a bicycle that Luyanda had stolen at home and was he able to ride one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, he was able to ride small bicycles, but there was no big bicycle that I saw that he had ridden.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> After that, did any one say he had been sold a bicycle by Luyanda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you, Thandiwe, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thandiwe Dano, there is something that I am not understanding well in your statement.  I wonder if you can clarify for me.  Are Luyanda's parents still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, they are still alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Why did they not give a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> His father had no way of giving a statement because he was not here, he was not there when Luyanda was detained by the police.  We had to report to him exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> And the mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> The mother is blind, she cannot see, she was there at the time, but now she is blind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you.  Secondly in your statement, unless there is a typing error, in March 1971, we were told that Luyanda was 15, is that a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, it is a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>7 TA DANO</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> It was in 1977?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> What exactly did Luyanda do in the struggle, what was his contribution because according to the statement he was advocating for the removal of teachers that were not acceptable.  Where there any political motives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, he was one of the children who fought for the needs of the students at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Was he a leader or just a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> He was just one of the students, really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> According to the statement, he was detained and then later charged for having stolen a bicycle, he was then in detention from June 1979, is this a mistake that according to the statement he was detained for a year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> It is a mistake, he was only detained for one month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> After he had been released from jail, it was discovered that he has a blood clot in the brain.  Was he taken to the Doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, the prison authorities took him to the Doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> After that, did you take any steps as a family to prosecute those who had caused his injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> I personally did not take any steps because there was no place I could run to.  We had to go to the police who were the perpetrators, the law was in their hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> If our investigators as a Commission, want the names of these people that you suspect caused the injuries, are you able to give the names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MS DANO:</span> Yes, we are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you Mrs Thandiwe Dano for having</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>8</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>testified here.  We are most aware of the contribution the youth especially students, made to the struggle especially here in Cradock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a> Most of the struggles that were led by students, some of them now have no future, because they spent their time in the struggle.  Luyanda's story is a reminder that there are children today, like Luyanda, he is literally in a mental institution because of a clot in the brain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a> Some children are not literally in mental institutions, but their lives are such that they have no future.  As a Commission we should look at this carefully because in the struggle, I remember that people like Matthew Goniwe, if students had not taken a position, the system would have had its way, but students like Luyanda sacrificed their future for the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a> Thank you Thandiwe for reminding us of those days, those important days.  We will look carefully at what you have said about Luyanda in your statement, we would like to go to the mental institution where he is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a> We would also like to know from the perpetrators themselves exactly what happened to Luyanda, why is it that they would take Luyanda, a healthy boy and then bring him back with a clot in the brain.  If we need any other details, we will come back to you.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a> We will now adjourn for 15 minutes, we will be back here at quarter past eleven.</p>
