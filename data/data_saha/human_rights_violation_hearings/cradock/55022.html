<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You mean sometimes he used to be a Doctor and sometimes he would be a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> And at the same time he would examine the people who were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Can you please go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS PLAATJIES:</span> They came to me, I fell.  I had a bullet on my neck, that caused me to fall.  They started assaulting me.</p>

<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a> One of them is big and fat.  At that time I was already bleeding through the nose and ears.  They said to me I must stand up and go and kiss the White man who was on the corner, they were pushing me towards him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a> They were kicking me.  One of them, by the name of Aron responded and said to the other policemen, he said, no stop doing this, this is our blood.  We can't do this in front of these people, in front of the capitalists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a> Why should we help the capitalists hitting our own people?  Aron said Bomba, this is your sister, you can't do this in front of the White policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a> He said the police should start home first.</p>

<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a> I think the Commission itself will be very interested in the picture that you are giving us about Dr Schoeman because this is a very interesting story that being a Doctor he is a policeman at the same time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a> He is a Doctor, he is a policeman at the same time of which those are two conflicting things.  We thank you for telling us this story.  We've taken note of your request.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a> As I've said we are just the mouth of the State President, we are just an eye of the State President, we are going to forward these requests to his table so that he can take a closer look at them.  </p>
