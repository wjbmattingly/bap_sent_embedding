I was working in Cape Town.\n When I was still at work, the police came to fetch me and they told me my brother has passed away.  We buried him.  When I arrived home, it was a long weekend, my mother was staying with my brother.  When they found his body laying dead the police said that they cannot keep him in Somerset East mortuary, we had to bury him immediately.\n I was in Cape Town and I couldn't come within three days to come to the funeral, so they kept my brother's body until Saturday and they told us to burry him before 12 o'clock.",

I want to thank people from Black Sash and other visitors who are here in this hearing today.\n We don't like to isolate people, but here in Cradock we have people who come everyday to support these hearings.  This is not the usual thing, but I think the Cradock people are showing us participation throughout these sessions of these hearings by the members of Black Sash and by other people who are from those communities which are historically advantaged, it is indeed very highly appreciated.\n For them to stay on, not to come in for an hour or two but to stay on throughout the day, from the beginning to the end of the session, is a gesture that I think will go a long way towards showing us that there are people in this country who are serious about our past and who are serious about reconciliation.\n We now stand adjourned until tomorrow.  We will meet tomorrow at half past eight, it will be our last day tomorrow and we hope by three o'clock we will be finished.  Thank you.",
