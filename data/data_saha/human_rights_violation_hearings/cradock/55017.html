<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> How can you describe him as a policeman, his behaviour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NOMAVUKA:</span> He was behaving well, I didn't have problems with him, because I knew him and his parents from the farm.</p>

<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mrs Nomavuka.  I'll hand over to the chairperson.  Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We thank you very much, we have heard your painful story.  We sympathise with you about what happened to you, it's very hurting to hear what one of you said, that when you used to seek for help from the police the police would just send you away.  But this is not a surprise because we know that it is something that used to happen during those days.  We thank you for coming to the Commission. What we cannot do is to give you back your beloved ones but the request that you forwarded, we're going to take it to the President, especially the one that you say about assistance and try to get the tombstone for your relatives.  On behalf of the Commission we deeply sympathise with you, we promise that we are going to forward all your requests to the President of this country.  Thank you.</p>
