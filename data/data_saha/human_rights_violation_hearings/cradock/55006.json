            "Thank you.  In 1992, there was a toyi-toyi here in town.  After that, people dispersed and they went to their different homes.\n In the afternoon the police came in my home, looking for Vuyisile.  When my mother asked them why they were looking for him, they didn't say.  Again at night, the\nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 XE MBOYA\npolice came looking for Vuyisile and my mother was asking them, why were you looking for him, and they didn't tell her why they were looking for him, they just said we want him.\n And one day Vuyisile was sleeping in the shack together with his friend, the police found him there.  His friend came to our home, he knocked at the door and he told us that the police found Vuyisile.  I tried to go to the creche in the morning to go and tell there that the police had found Vuyisile and arrested him.\n When I arrived there, the creche was closed.  I found one man who was working there and he told me to go home, he will tell the people there.\n At that time Vuyisile was already killed by the police and they took Vuyisile to their offices.  When I came back from the creche, I heard some people talking, they were saying that Vuyisile was dead.  I came back home and then I told my mother that Vuyisile is dead, I heard that from people on the street.\n We tried to go out, looking for him, as he was taken by the police.  When we arrived at the office where he was killed, the gates were closed.  They were closed at the time he was killed, he was shot and killed.  We went to town to the offices in town.\n When we arrived there, they said they didn't know him.  We were confused, we didn't know where to go.  We stood there, there was one man who came to us and he advised us to go and look for him in the hospital.  He said that he might not be dead, he might be in the hospital.  We went to the hospital.\n When we arrived there, the security man told us that there is no such person there.  We went back to the office\nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 XE MBOYA\nand the police told us they did not know him, there was no such person there.  We were so confused, we didn't know what to do.\n After a while we went back to the hospital.  When we arrived at the hospital, we found him there.  When we were looking at the drawer in the hospital, his mouth was full of sand.  I came back to my mother and I told her that it is true, Vuyisile is dead.\n When I arrived at home, there were comrades there trying to comfort my mother.  We tried to find out what happened to him as he was taken by the police, we couldn't find anything.  \n We wanted to know who killed him, we didn't know, we didn't find out.  Up until now, we don't know who killed Vuyisile.  There were rumours that he was killed by a Coloured police, again by a White police.  Just because we had nothing, we didn't do anything up until now.",

            "Thank you Miss Mboya, you gave us a testimony about an incident which happened in 1992.\nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n8 XE MBOYA\n I think it is five years from then, but the way you gave us the testimony it shows that you still have pain inside you and we could see in your face that you still feel the pain.\n It is our aim in this Commission that the people involved in these incidents, would come here when people are giving testimony so that they could see how painful the incidents were.  \n What we see in them is that they go to the Amnesty Committee, asking for amnesty and others go there without feeling or knowing how painful this thing is to the people.\n Again, I think that the story you have presented in front of us is similar to the one  Mrs Lizzie James gave before you.  The way in which the courts were not responsible and respecting the cases of the people who were fighting for liberation.  I would like to repeat what I said before that it is our hope that those who are in the Justice Department now, are listening to these stories and the way in which the Justice Department has shown that it cares for the people.\n We thank you and we will try by all means to look at the matter you have presented in front of us and we would like the death of your brother not to look as if he was just a dog.\n If there are any other things we would like to know from you, our investigators will come to you and collect some information, thank you.",
