            "My name is Lawrence Mbambo of Number 2280 Lekota Street, Wattville.  I was married to Dr Siatemba Limbi Joyce Ndaba who was 31 years of age at that time and who was practising as a dentist at Matadeni Hospital, Newcastle in Kwazulu/Natal.\nIn 1991 I was the secretary of the ANC Benoni branch.  We, the Executive of the ANC, under the leadership of Jepin Potini, received information from Intelligence in Shell House, that there were people who were monitoring \nthe Committee when it was attending its meeting in Actonville in the ANC office. \nSo what we did after that, we had to change out venues in conducting our meetings every Monday, within our Executive Committee.  We had to change from one house to another house.  At this stage there was a lot of rumours and agitators around the township and the hostels in Wattville.  \nThere were people who were trying to provoke violence in the township and during that time the violence was spreading from Tokoza to Vosloorus.  It had moved now to Benoni.  It was in Daveyton.  So after receiving a threat two weeks later on the 24th November 1991, it was a Sunday about 8 o'clock in the evening, my house was attacked by a gunman and we did not know his name at that time.  Inside the house, inside the kitchen, my wife was sitting on a chair after cooking, waiting to dish out.  And I was not in the house by then.  My sister was in the house busy ironing in the dining-room.  \n This gentleman knocked first and my wife said: \"Come in\".  Before she could ask what he wants, he entered the door and told them to keep quiet and then pulled a AK-47 \nand shot several bullets at them.  Then, immediately after shooting, the guy vanished.   My sister was ironing in the dining room.  She could see the person.   She could describe the man as a short, young black person who aged at plus minus 20 years of age.\nThen, after pulling the gun, my sister ran for her life and hid herself in one of the bedrooms.  She just went under the bed.  Thereafter she started screaming.   Then a neighbour who heard the shots and the people around the street who saw the guy was running...  The neighbour went straight to my aunt's house and by that time I was at my aunt's place, which was eight houses away.\nThe neighbour came to report that I had been killed, only to find me sitting in the dining room.   Then from there we went to the house to find that my wife was lying down in the kitchen full of blood, already dead.\nThen we reported the matter to the police.  The police investigated the case.   The person who was responsible for investigating the case was a certain detective Mashego, who told us that once we get any information we must come back to them then they will arrest the person and then my sister will come to do an identification parade.\nThen when she is gone she would be protected she would be put under a one way glass, where you could see the people and those people could not see you.\nThen I got information from my neighbours, from a lady called Vulazani James, who happened to know the guy who killed my wife. The guy was staying in the hostel and after the incident used to come and sit with some of the people in the township and other IFP members where they drank together.   The guy boasting that they killed the wrong person.  They are still coming back.  The person that they wanted to kill was me, was myself.\nThe name of the person who told me the information, the name of the guy is Mosa Reginald Hlangwane, of Block 7, Room 448, Wattville Hostel.   That guy was working at Eclipse as a welder at that time.   And that guy was known as a gunman for the IFP.  \nThe reason for attacking my house was that Tentown was a strategic area for the IFP.  Most of the leadership of the IFP by that time was around Tentown section.  So, it was the area where they could hide their guns, because the hostels was not a safe place. All the time police were taking their guns, attacking them and take their guns.  \nSo it was a strategic area for them. So they wanted to remove all the ANC first in Tentown.   Point number two was to eliminate the leadership of the ANC in the township.   The third one - I am known as a Zulu, why a Zulu join Xhosas? - because I am a Zulu I was supposed to join them, no to choose the political organisation that I like.\nThose are the reasons that was given by the person who is supposed to give information to the Truth Commission, but any moment, she has been threatened twice by the Chairman of the IFP, Shadrack Zwane, that if ever she dared talk she is going to be killed. \nWhat I find frustrating at this point in time is that Investigating Officer, Mr Mashego, passed the docket to a certain detective, Mr Watson, who was stationed in Daveyton, who was responsible for investigating those dockets at the time, and I have spoken to Mr Watson many times trying to find the docket.\nFirst, he told me in 1995, he did not know where the docket was.   Then I told him that I intend opening the case, taking the matter to the Truth Commission.   Then after taking my statement to the Truth Commission then I spoke to him again last year in April, trying to get the docket with all the information that I had written before.\nWhat is frustrating is, that even now, no one can tell where the docket is.   He told me last week that the docket was taken by a certain Mr Blake in Tembisa to investigate the matter further, a certain Mr Blake who had died and nobody knows where he left the docket.\nMy question was, if a policemen dies don't they have a system or a record where they record that so and so has taken a file and so and so must take the file now because this one has died.\nThen what he told me last week, because I keep on insisting and worrying him, he told me that I must go to a certain Mr Capt Knoetze in Tembisa who was in charge of those guys who were investigating the case.   Then I told him that Mr Knoetze...   The person I know is you.  You have to take the responsibility to find out where the file is and because I need more information from that file and the Truth Commission wants to investigate.\nSo he just gave me the phone number and said I must contact the certain Mr Knoetze who is at Tembisa Police Station and forget about him.  The phone number he gave me is 975 8000.   \nI was legally married to Lindiwe who died and left a son by the name of Sizwe Mbambo, who was 11 months at that point in time.   Sizwe was not staying with us.  Sizwe was staying with my in-laws in Durban, in Ntizuma.  \nThe reason for Sizwe to stay with the in-laws was that it was convenient for us since Lindiwe was completing her studies at Medunsa, so the child was still staying with my in-laws.   \nSo after completing in July 1991, she got a job to work at Matadeni Hospital.   She died after three months after she started working.\nSince that incident my in-laws refused me seeing the child.  My in-laws both are also IFP members.  From the day we reported that Lindiwe died they never came to me, instead they just told me that, you and your ANC have slaughtered your sheep.  Eat.  After eating, bring back our bones.  That is all I got from them.\nSo the problem I have, is I do not have access to my child, since 1993.   Before 1993 I used to go and visit my child, but I would meet an angry family who would ask me questions like, you are happy to come and see yours, where is our child?\nSo the last incidence where I went to Ntizuma to my child was in 1993, where I was nearly killed in the house.  Fortunately, thank God, I asked the police from Kwamashu Police Station to accompany me.  Those are the people who saved me, because that was the day I was going to be killed by the family and the IFP from the hostels in Kwamashu.\nMy in-laws are holding me responsible for the death of my wife, just because I am an ANC and they are IFP and before I got married they were once attacked by the ANC youth in Kwamashu.  So they hated ANC.\nSo, I would like the Truth Commission to help me in \nthis regard.  I think a public hearing might clear my name from the communities, first in Wattville, the communities in Durban who were first to start this information and also it would clear my name also within my in-laws and my family, because once they are clear, that we are told that the person who killed my wife was another IFP member who intended to kill me because I was not in the house.  They just shot randomly, because they know definitely we are going feel it even if you are not there.  Once they kill your loved one, definitely you cannot say they have not killed you.\nAnd another point that I want to state here in front of the public is that I am a man who believes in peace.  I would like to reconcile with my in-laws.  I am prepared to forgive the perpetrators, providing they come forward and tell their side of the story, what they did, especially the Hlangwane guy who sent him to do that.\nAnd also if he could apologise to my in-laws who are IFP, like him.   Maybe in that way I will be able to see my child.\nOne of the information that I had from the lady that I mentioned before is that the perpetrator was sent by the Chairman of the IFP Youth in Wattville by the name of Chadrack Zwane and a certain Mr Buthelezi, who was also staying in Tentown, who was an IFP official.  Those were the people who sent him to kill me.\nThe eye witnesses who saw the guy after shooting because it was about eight o'clock and people were still moving in the streets, so they saw the gunman jumping the fence and went to Corner Street where the Chairman, Mr Chadrack Zwane was renting a room.   Then the gunman left \nthe gun there and after that he went to the hostel.\nThat is the information that I have.   Thank you Mr Chairman.",

I think you need to actually understand that some of the issues you raised are issues which have legal implications.\nWith regard to the investigation into the killing of your wife, certainly that is something which the Commission is pursuing and as you yourself mentioned, Fanie ..., one of our Investigators, is trying to get as much information on the case as possible and to follow up on the leads which are provided in your statement.\nBut with regard to your son, I mean, I would actually urge that you do seek proper legal advice because that is not something that is necessarily in the legal ambit of \nthe Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\nCertainly if the parties involved in this very very sad and tragic affair want the Truth Commission to facilitate some kind of reconciliation or to facilitate counselling or assist in that way then that is something that the Truth Commission, and in particular the Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee can look at.\nBut as to the question of your son and the question of access that is really a legal matter and therefore I just want to reinforce what my colleague has actually said that we would strongly urge that you do get legal advice.   I understand your financial situation but there are agencies, there is the...  There are legal aid clinics, there is one actually in Germiston and if you want to later, I can give you the telephone number of the Legal Aid Clinic in Germiston and there are places like the University of the Witwatersrand and the Rand Afrikaans University, where there are legal aid clinics, because as you say you are the father, that the child was born in wedlock and therefore you do have certain rights, which the courts will uphold.\nSo I would urge that you actually pursue that and if there are other matters, around counselling or reconciliation where the Commission can play a role then certainly the Commission would look at that.\nThank you.",
