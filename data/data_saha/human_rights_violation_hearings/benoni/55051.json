            "It was on the 30th of October 1992, in the morning of that day, at half past five to six.  I was working at Clicks next to Denver at the Trade Centre Building.    I just knocked off that morning because I was attending the night shift.   I was using the train for my travelling.\n I was already aboard the train from Denver, which was go to via Germiston.   At Delmore more than 50 men entered the train.   Some had weapons, guns and assegais.   \n I used to read novels in the train, struggling books, to want to furnish myself with information as far as political organisations, the way they started and where were they headed to.\n This particular book was centred in politics, the very one that I was reading at the time when the men entered the train.\n There was one young man amongst them and he was sent to me to ask my name.   I told him my name, that I was Lazarus Shabangu.   He took the book I was reading.  He actually grabbed it, very indecent.   He asked me where I was from and where I was headed to and why I was reading that particular book.   \n Even before I could answer the very group that I was in, the majority was women.  I started seeing people spreading around at the coach.   Before the twinkling of an eye they took me towards the train door.  \n They started assaulting me.   They told the youngest guy to hit me with a clap.  They assaulted me.   One of them drew out a gun.  I heard a loud bang of noise and gunshots.   I heard women screaming and that was the time that they shot me right here.   They shot again twice.  The other bullet got stuck right here on my right hand cheek.\n From there I lost strength, but I could hear them very vaguely, saying he is dead.  \n The train was in motion.   One said, let us throw him out of the train.   The door was opened and they threw me out of the train after chopping me on my forehead.  The train was in motion when they threw me out of it.\n I do not know what happened after that, because when I gained my consciousness I was already admitted to this hospital, asking the attendant where was I and what had happened?   They told me, you are two weeks in this ward at BBH Hospital.   \n I had my parents with me, coming to visit me in hospital.  That is it.",
