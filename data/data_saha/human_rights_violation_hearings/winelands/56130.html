<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>Thank you very much, I will ask advocate  Denzil Potgieter to lead your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>Thank you very much Wendy, Chairperson just indicate that the testimony of the next 4 witnesses relates to the same incident which the Mayor Mr McClune spoke about in Wolseley on the 24th of November 1990.  They were all injured in the incident and we will hear their testimony about what happened to them personally in this particular incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a> Ms Segrys can you hear well, a hearty welcome to you here once again.  The Mayor of Wolseley has described to us what the circumstances that day were.  What happened that day in Wolseley or in general what happened.  You yourself was also shot that day, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>MS SEGRYS</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>Yes. </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>Would you like to tell us what specifically happened to you, how did it happen that you were shot that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>MS SEGRYS</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>I was involved in the Inauguration of this hall, I went home to buy some cigarettes.  I was just standing there and I went to the  shop.  It was just in between the hall and the Montana  Cafe, I was standing there counting my  money.  While I was counting the money people shouted:</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>Run, run he was going to shoot you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>I didn't take that into regard and I just kept on counting my money, it was R1-80 - that was the last money I had.  Somebody said - it was - somebody said look around and the police started shooting and I said:</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>Don't shoot me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>And he just shot and he kept on shooting till I fell down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a> While I was lying there I look him right into the face and he kept on shooting me.  And then eventually I left - I lost my conscience.  Later on when I regained consciousness I decided I'm going to run and try to get home.  I only got so far as 2 old woman and they assisted me and took me to Ms Fredericks' house.  Ms Zeeman took one of the people's shirts and put a bandage around the vain on my leg where I was hurt.  Afterwards I remained in her house and Ms Zeeman came there and said there was a ambulance waiting, they took me to the Community Hall where the ambulance was waiting.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>Where  - while we were waiting for the other people we went to Dr Nell's surgery.  We waited there for about 20 minutes and then Mr Adam Clune - McClune arrived there.  He and my mother-in-law, they were talking while the ambulance drivers were assisting the people.  Afterwards we were taken to the Eben Donges Hospital where we were treated.  2 weeks - 2 to 3 weeks afterwards we appeared in court.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>We told our whole story in court and later it happened that the whole court case came to a standstill and nothing happened.  Because - and then I decided I had to make a plan to go back to work.  Later I got married, my husband assisted me and the bird shot was removed from my leg and from my forehead, my arm and my leg.  He said he couldn't do anything about my hand because the bullet was lodged in a sinew.  </p>
