When I regained consciousness I was in the hospital - in Eben Donges Hospital.  And the Sunday morning I was laying there and a doctor came and took X-rays of my head and it was found that I had bird in my left finger as well.\n They took X-rays and I could see the - how the bird shot had disintegrated in my head and it looked like clouds in the sky.",
