When we came to near the bioscope, people started throwing stones and we were forced to run into Mr Abrahams' shop.  He locked the door and we stood inside until everything had calmed down.  Round about 2 o'clock he told us that we could go out and that we could go home.  \n My husband and I and my sister walked home.  When we passed the police station I looked around and said there's a policeman standing there, aiming his gun at us.  He's going to shoot us and she said you can run, I'm not going to run because we haven't done anything wrong.  And then I stood still and my sister started walking on.  Then suddenly, while standing there. I heard shots.  After that - after this shot had quieted down - I came out and on my way to home my son came running along and said\nMommy, Aunty Eva had been shot.\nAnd I said where is she?  And he said I've picked her up and carried her home.  My husband and I went home and when I came there she was laying on the bed and she could still say\nJa, take me to the hospital because they've shot me.\nAnd she said\nWhere did they shoot me?\nAnd they said they' shot me because I  haven't done anything.  And I said\nWait, we'll go home to fetch the car.\nWhen I came there my mother asked me where my sister was and I said\nNo she's at my house.\nBecause I didn't want to tell her that she had been shot.  While we were standing there, my eldest daughter came there to tell us that her mother had died and - but I said no she couldn't be dead, she's just told me that I had to take her to hospital.  We still put her into the car and took her to the hospital.  The doctor put her on a stretcher and took her into the hospital.  \nAfter a quarter of an hour he came out and he told us that she had died on the way to hospital.  We got into the car and the doctor said we had to go to the police station.  Having arrived there, I told them that I wanted a - to tell them that my sister had been killed and he said\nOh dear, another hotnot-meid had been killed.\nAnd I said it not a dog who had been killed, it's a human being.  Then I turned round and went  home to tell my mother that my sister had been shot.  Thank you.",
