Whilst lying there I heard some sounds from a certain direction - their were bullet sounds.  They kept on, then I stood up and I went to look for Vuyo.  And when I got there I could see people moving up and down - there was commotion, but I couldn't see Vuyo.  \n Then I saw a policeman, I decided to went - to go back home.  Whilst lying there I heard screams and people calling my name saying that my son had been shot.  So I stood up and I went there and I found him lying there at the door.  I ran and I phoned for the ambulance.  It took time to come so I decided to take my neighbours car, drove to hospital and at the hospital we were told that we had to go to the Red Cross Hospital.  And we did exactly that, then the doctor attended him.  \n He called me and told me that he had been shot in the intestines but the bullet was - he had been shot in the stomach and the bullet had pierced through into the intestine and he had to have an operation. \n On Monday morning I went back home and I went to the Mbekweni Police Station to lay a charge there.  When I got there the police said I should go back and come back later.  I decided to go to the Police Station in town to lay a charge.  When I got there they wrote down the statement - wrote everything down and asked me to go back home.\n Vuyo was in hospital for 3 weeks and it was quiet, then I decided to go back to the hospital to go and find out what was happening about the case.  When were they going to call me to Court.  They told me that they had gone to Court already and everything was through.  So they said I could take further steps if I wanted to but I didn't have means to.",
