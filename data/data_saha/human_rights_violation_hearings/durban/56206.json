He went to Johannesburg to his friends, so that he would stay there.

At that time he was a clerk there.  I went to school here in Durban and my father took me to King Edward.  I also became a clerk in King Edward.  During that time I joined the ANC.  That was the most famous organization in King Edward at that time.  I worked there and in 1963 I was arrested.  We were arrested with regard to ANC, but I did get released by this lawyer called Austin.  After that I had left King Edward.  I went to do the taxi job.  I didn't like this taxi job and I went to the firms (?).  I educated my children and they went to Ongoye.

So I started being hated by the owners of this firm, because I'm putting the union which is aligned to ANC and the tanks could be burnt.

I got so pressurised and harassed and the soldiers used to come at this national key point and the Railway Police also used to follow me up.  I realised that I must leave this job, because I was in danger.  I left this job in 1990.  I went to stay at home.

            "  May I just go a little bit behind 1974?  My first arrest took place in 1964.  It was for a few hours at the Berea Police Station.  In 1965 I joined Umkhonto we Sizwe and I led a major student demonstration in Stanger and also I ran the underground structure for the ANC in Stanger and I was also part of the sabotage unit, and during this student boycott I had painted some slogans, which at that time was considered sabotage.  I was arrested and interrogated for almost a whole day in 1965 and thereafter the special branch were regular visitors to my home.  In 1971 when Ahmed Timol was arrested and killed I was also subject to police special branch scrutiny.  That was in 1971.  In 1974, on the 28th 13B/4 September, I was arrested under the Terrorism Act, section 6, and I was taken to the Fisher Street headquarters of the special branch and there I was photographed, fingerprinted and verbally abused.  Thereafter I was kept in a prison cell in Greenwood Park Police Station.  That was on a Saturday, and on the Monday my interrogation started.  It used to usually start at about half past eight in the morning and last till about four in the afternoon.  At this time the interrogation - during this time of the interrogation there was no physical torture, just mental torture, and for two weeks I was interrogated and obviously the police were not happy with the answers that I gave to them and then they decided to torture me physically and there was a ritual to the torture the police used to do, and that was to force me on to the ground with my - both my hands and my feet and they used to tie my shoes around my neck and the interrogation used to begin and, in order to extract the information they were looking for, they used to quite often grab me by my head and bang it against the wall.  Then the other form of torture that used to take place was they used to make me sit on what they used to call an invisible chair.  An invisible chair is you pretend that you sit on a chair, but there's no chair there, and you hold your hands out and you flick your fingers.  They interrogate you and you have to answer the questions and this invisible chair position was quite close to the wall, but not - I wasn't allowed to lean against the wall and in front of me one of the special branch policemen used to hold a knife at my navel, so as to prevent me from falling easily to the ground and if they were not satisfied with the answers I",

He said I was lying and he said I should disclose the information they wanted, and the information they wanted was admission that I was part of Umkhonto we Sizwe, I was a member of the ANC and the South African Communist Party, and at that time I was in charge of the library of the SACP and they wanted to know where I used to hide it, and they also wanted me to admit all the sabotages that I had committed over the years, and after laying the complaint they took me to the district surgeon and the district surgeon examined me while my interrogators were present in his surgery and the district surgeon took samples of my blood.  Apparently he suspected that my kidneys were damaged, and up to now I don't know the result of that blood test, and when I was taken back to Fisher Street, in the lift I said to the policeman that one day when they'll become our prisoners we will treat them with compassion and they laughed at me.  They took me upstairs and they beat me up for that and then they said there's a very high-ranking policeman in the next office.  I should go to him and lay a formal charge with him.  So",

He used to go from New York to Tanzania regarding the ANC activities and our father and the whole family knew that Ndo was in Tanzania.

He was driving a Golf.  He used to change this Golf after two weeks.  I would see him in another Golf.  A few weeks he would be coming again in another Golf.  Those were new Golf cars he was driving, but sometimes he would come and ask me to cook for him and he would give me some money.  He would be giving me very new notes of rands.  I thought they came from the bank, because they looked very new.  I became very suspicious because when - we knew that if a person had been in exile was arrested inside the country they used to turn the boys to make them work for them.  First of all, they would get information from them and then he would be called an, \"Askari\".  I used to read those kind of things from newspapers and I did become suspicious but all the time when I tried to ask him he never explained anything to me.  He stayed to me for about five to six months.  At all those times he was driving Golfs.  He would disappear for two or three days and then come back again.

I didn't know how to help him in this condition that he was in, because it seems he was torn in between two and that he has got new masters, but in his heart maybe it wasn't like that.  I didn't know what to do, because he wasn't speaking to me, even when I asked him, \"But Ndo, what has happened?  Why are you no longer anxious?\", he never said a thing.  He just kept quiet.  If he realised that I continued talking to him or asking him questions he would just say, \"Good-bye\" or just go and stay with his colleagues and friends.  That was the usual thing in the township, is hanging around along the poles under the trees.  Then they would just stay there and he would leave me along.  So I also didn't want to pursue this matter, but I was worried about this.  He really showed that he was no longer happy.  There was a time when he would look at me and start - tears would roll down his cheeks, but I didn't want to ask what was happening.  Those things continued for a while, until the end of 1988.  From there he told me that he was going to disappear for a while.  He was going to disappear for a few months and he will come back again, but he was still driving these new Golfs and changing them all the time, but I never took any numberplate of those Golf cars he was driving.

He asked for a bag - my bag, just among my own bags I had.  He packed a few things.  It was a very small bag.  He put all those things in his bag.

But for the purpose of this document, I want to focus on the role of the legal and judicial processes and how they would have exerted some of that control in some way.  At the highest level of the Judiciary and the legal system were a relatively select group of judges, who were responsible for most of the judicial executions or murders of political activists, freedom fighters or terrorists, as they were called by the agents of apartheid and the ignorant.  This same group of judges dealt with most of the political trials that led to the conviction and incarceration of many political activists.  In many of these cases these judges allowed evidence that was extracted under conditions of extreme torture and routine torture to facilitate a conviction for the apartheid state.

Now, whether the evidence was concocted, false or tailored to secure a conviction didn't matter much, but these judges - specific judges - played a very powerful role in legitimising an illegitimate and evil system of government.  One may ask, \"What were their motives?\"   I am sure I have many answers, but I would hope that they would or some of them would probably come to this Commission and say what their motives were themselves.  I want to highlight one case which I think we have heard about already, and that's of Andrew Zondo - a very young person, who was found guilty of the bomb blast at Amanzimtoti and was sentenced to death.  There were extenuating circumstances in his case and in many other cases, but the one extenuating circumstance that stands out was the factor of his youth.  He was a very young man, and I think evidence has already been led before the Commission about his background.  This factor of his youth alone would have spared him his life in any other civilised court of the world, but this did not happen.  His particular case and the manner in which it was conducted was very distinct from - in the way it was, as I would put it - steamrolled.  It went very fast from the time of his arrest, to trial, to conviction, to appeal, petition, and his very swift execution.  Before even the normal progressive groupings in the country could gather",

Many others before and after him were executed on the orders of judges, as it was, and a lot of political activists and detainees who were tried and were sentenced to death were saved because towards the latter part of the 1980s campaigns were conducted, largely at the international level, which highlighted the plight of these people who were sentenced to death by this regime and many, many of them were saved, and one can highlight the example of the Sharpeville six, which received a great deal of international attention.  There were judges as well who did not impose the death penalty and they were a tiny minority, but what one found was that in the nature of the insidious set-up that operated in this legal system was that these judges who were known to be partial to the struggle of the people in a way, or slightly sympathetic or not happy with the erosion of the rule of law, these persons never or hardly ever handled a serious or contentious political case.  And, amongst all the progressive lawyers in this country, I believe, it was a common fact that specific judges and magistrates were selected to deal with political cases and others were bypassed if they were seen to be neutral.

And one recalls in Pietermaritzburg, in particular, many interdicts were granted against the warlords of that region and liberal interpretations of the harsh, repressive legislation were given by certain judges in this province and this eroded a lot into the apartheid thinking and the apartheid jurisprudence.  This was obviously unacceptable to those in power and Judge Milne, being the brilliant and the kind person that he came across as, was conveniently, in our opinion, promoted, as it were or called to higher office and was taken to the Appellate Division, where he was made an Appellate Division Judge and in the Appellate Division he was neutralised with about 11 to 15 judges with a Chief Justice that was unsympathetic to the cause of the people and, in effect, that was the end of Judge Milne in terms of the influence that he could have brought to bear on the judiciary of this country and he was not heard of again until his death.

            "14B/16 I want to touch on another case of how the judiciary worked and that was, again the case of the late Mr Joseph Mdluli.  He was killed in detention.  Different from all other examples of murders in detention, here the person or persons allegedly close to him while in detention were charged and were tried in the Supreme Court, and one may ask, \"Why did this unusual event take place?\"  Well, what had happened was when this detainee - when he was killed, Mr Mdluli's body lay in a mortuary of an undertaker.  This undertaker, who was also a sympathetic person to the struggle, had seen his body and had seen the wounds on his body, took photographs and brought this to the attention of people, lawyers and others, to say that this is what had happened to this person.  Through the underground network these photographs reach London.  They were published in newspapers in London and had gained international attention.  In many ways that forced the Government of the day and maybe the authorities to show that, \"Yes, we don't condone murders of political detainees, so we should charge someone\", and that person -a senior security branch police officer, was charged with one or two other policemen who were his juniors.  Of course, the security policeman was not found guilty and the persons were acquitted and in a broad sense the finding was the detainee had injured himself and died while falling off a chair.  Now, we know many of our leaders today had escaped sentence of death as a result of maybe a change of heart by some judges, but many others were sentenced to death, but those leaders who escaped are very prominent in leading our country into a democratic future and one may well ask what role those who were",

One must look at the whole apartheid legal system and I don't want to go into too much of detail here, just to highlight the different categories of people who played a role in making all the evil of apartheid go smoothly in those dark days, and I would highlight the role of the attorney-general and their staff and the many advocates who worked under them, who relished their task in prosecuting political trials, where they really tore into people who were put on trial and used every means possible to secure convictions.  The second categories is the state attorneys and their staff, who defended and covered up for police brutality in thousands of civil claims over the years and who provided the legal defence for perpetrators of violence against people during those days.  The many senior magistrates - this is the next category - in the regional courts, who did as much and more than the judges in the Supreme Court in terms of the volume and their enthusiasm.  Justice in the lower courts was not meted out with the finesse of the Supreme Courts in those days.  One does not have to remind ourselves of the post-mortem hearings and the mockery that they made of justice in this country, where all the detainees who were murdered were subjected to this sham of a post-mortem hearing.  The cases of Steve Biko, Ahmed Timol, Dr Haffejee, Neil Aggett and many other detainees who were tortured to death.  This reinforced the violence of apartheid and gave support, protection and gumption to the foot soldiers and policemen of apartheid.

            "14B/21 legal profession's watchdogs of apartheid?  These societies and councils, with senior lawyers, moved the Supreme Court and the judges to strike off political activists who were convicted of apartheid crimes.  Many lawyers were barred from earning a living or were forced into exile.  The late Braam Fischer, Ntobeka Maquabela, Kader Hassim, the late Mr M D Naidoo and Roley Aronstein, who died just about a week ago, are a few of the cases that come to mind.  Mr Aronstein, in particular, after being struck off the roll, was even barred from working as an ordinary legal clerk in the offices, I recall, of Mr Ravi Bagwandeen, and this is how far the evils of apartheid extended.  There were also minor people, like the registrars of the Supreme Court, who worked with these judges, but then I must touch on also another category, and these are defence lawyers, and in that field I would count myself amongst them, who in the name of justice and morality, subverted the truth wherever possible to minimise the consequences of the morally correct struggle of the Kaders and the liberation movements.  There are other categories, but they are probably too many to mention and I won't go on any more.  I think the question that arises out of all this is what legacy have we inherited?  I see it as a rotten legal order with morally-crippled participants - a future legal order that is riddled with villains of apartheid, which is being allowed to go, save for a few exceptions, unchecked, unchallenged and with impunity into the future to uphold truth and justice and the sanctity of the State in this new democracy.

Our society will find it difficult to develop a true human rights culture with those who have flagrantly violated it still in charge without them having accounted for their conduct, showing remorse and committing themselves to truth and justice for the future.  The judicial legal system was a vehicle that delivered apartheid for its architects in the Legislature.  The policemen, soldiers and killer operatives with their chiefs and generals drove this vehicle, until it went out of control.  Why should only these drivers be the subject of attention before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission?  One can mention the people in the Bantustans, the SAIC and the CRC as well, but if we want to build a future for this country without the necessity of Nuremburg trials then the full extent of apartheid wrong-doings must be contextualised correctly, honestly and courageously.

In addition to what the Deputy Chair has said, one of the factors that we are asked to take into account is - would be recommendations about structures that would ensure that such violations will not recur and your submission is helpful in so far as it highlights one of the critical structures of a free and democratic society is the Judiciary and the judicial system and that we would be looking into things of that kind when we make our recommendations about the sorts of things that might, in fact, be considered in order to prevent a like occurrence of violations of human rights.  We hope, of course, that we would get people giving another perspective, because the Act requires that we",

I think we should not apologise for hearing a point of view, but I also don't wish to even feel intimidated by another point of view of another political party.  There is only one approach to justice and morality.  There cannot be two sides to justice and morality, with great respect, and I do appeal to the Commission not to feel intimidated - not to even think that you have compromised yourself by hearing me today or a point of view, because I think history has recorded this kind of conduct in many parts of the world and I would be most interested and I would wait with bated breath to hear whether there can be another point of view for the role of people who upheld an unjust regime.  I understand the context in which you are placed in this particular province, but I say with great respect, we should never be afraid of the truth and I believe this is what this Truth and Reconciliation Commission is about and I do believe that, strongly - I just cannot believe that there could be some point of view that is on the other side.  The best that one can hear is that, \"Well, there were factors that caused me or other people on the other side to take a different perspective\", but certainly there cannot be another morality and another justice.  I am not saying that this is the one, but I do believe that the Commission will identify only one justice and one morality for this country, for Africa and for the world.   /Thank you.",

We have not yet indicated what our own point of view is.  It would be utterly counter-productive if we were out of hand to reject other points of view and this is what we are saying.  One of the problems about our country has been our - I mean, the intolerance - I mean even the intolerance of those who know that they are right.
