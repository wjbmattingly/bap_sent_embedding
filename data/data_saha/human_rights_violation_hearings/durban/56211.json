I would like to say on behalf of my grandmother, Jane, who we visited this week before coming to the hearings and told her what we would be doing here.   She lost her son, her only child, and a son that she adored.   She has never recovered from his death.    She spent years trying to find out who killed her son, and she was frustrated and felt very alone and very abandoned in that search in the end.  She got cancer, from which she has recovered, which is a sign of her extraordinary strength, but I think she feels very bitter and very angry and very alone in her loss.  And in the lack of any attempt to help her get satisfaction by finding a killer.   And I think she is still very depressed and I think it would be wonderful if the truth commission could do something for her.

And I think for me that has been, being able to speak out the pain has enabled me to reconcile with a terrible past.   And to be able to be present and without that trauma overshadowing it.  \nAnd so I think that the process that you are engaged in and that we are all engaged in is a very important one in the reconciliation aspect of it is crucial.

And try to deal with the aftermath of that murder.\nKim has been very marked by it.  To this day she can't sleep in a room on the ground floor.   I think that he is a huge hole in their lives at every family event:  when Jan was married to David;  when Kim was married to Richard;   when Alexandra was born.   Richard is dreadfully missed.   You can never replace what was taken away.  So, you take away the present as well.   Fowzia was right, you take away the past and the future, but you take the present for them.   He is always there.   \nI think that for Jan and here I want to pay tribute to Jan, because without Jan we wouldn't have half the facts of this case.   Without Jan a lot of what we do now know, a lot of our need to know would not have been satisfied.   Jan's way of dealing with the pain, as she said herself, was to go and find out.

The fact that you have gone to so much trouble and that so many of you are part of this, I think is an enormous tribute to Ric, and reminds us that he is not dead.\nI think, secondly, your attribute to him today and your desire to find out the truth reminds us all that one vicious act touches some many people, not just one, but families, children, and children to come.   But you have also reminded us that ideas are powerful.   \nWhy they didn't like Richard Turner was not that he was not an activist, because really deeply down he wasn't one.   He was much more dangerous.   He had ideas and you can't kill an idea.   Yes, it is true that bearers of ideas become victims, but their ideas are passed on, and I think one of the greatest encouragements for you and for all of us is that the ideas that he espoused and propagated  shared, argued  about, debated, have come true.\nYes, we are a very young, weak, struggling democracy.   Yes, freedom is limited.   But, the pain we have now is not the pain of death, or the dance of death, it birth pain, and Richard Turner and many others were the midwives.   \nYou have asked for us to do certain things.   Let me say to Fowzia that obviously personally and in many other ways many of us would like to see that chair.   We would think it is well deserved.   This is not entirely within the scope of the commission.   We would have to be discussion with the university, but that discussion will take place.\nAs far as the subpoenas are concerned, and the attempt to find out even so much such a long time after the event, we have already issued subpoenas for:\nColonel Andy Taylor;\nBrigadier Chris Earl;\nUri Prinsloo;\nDavid Beeldus;\nArnold van der Westhuizen.\nWe are already in discussion with Paul Erasmus and Martin Dolinchek.   And tomorrow Basie Smit, who has already been subpoenaed, will be answering questions at a meeting that I will be at and some of my colleagues in Cape Town.   \nNow, you will appreciate that it is extraordinary difficult to get to the truth.   You have experienced how difficult it is.   More than most.   We cannot promise that we will find the truth.   That we will pursue it, that we can promise.\nI personally am very deeply encouraged by the events of this week.   Who would have thought that a Commission of Police, a former commissioner of the Police, the head of police in this country, would point a finger publicly at a former minister and a former State President.  Now, some of that truth has come about by subpoena.   Some of it because people cannot live with themselves any longer and need to tell the truth.   There are many ways.   I am not at all despairing that we will find the truth, I simply say we cannot promise that.   I actually think that there is an extremely good chance that the truth will be known.\nWhat you do with that truth is up to you.   We, in the commission, are working towards reconciliation.  We think the truth is absolutely essential if there is to be reconciliation in South Africa.   We think your search and your quest and your suffering is a major contribution in that regard, but you would be the first to acknowledge that there are thousands upon thousands of South Africans across the length and breadth of this land whose truth must be known.   Our resources are very slim.   Our time is limited.   We will do what we can.  \nThe commission will stand adjourned for about 20 minutes and we will return at twenty two twelve.

Now, that caused him to be harassed, that is where we are going to start, that is from 1979, tell us what happened and tell us what were the consequences as from 1979.   You can relate the story to us.   ---   In 1979, the community of Lamontville asked Mzizi that he should join the election, because they were electing councillors, and he did actually enter the elections but his name was not chosen, so consequently he was not elected.   And I remember at that time I was at home, he came and showed me a voter's roll.   And he further proceeded to tell me that in this voter's roll there is something that doesn't gel, that is not procedural and he needed to consult some legal people.   And he stayed for the whole night looking at this voter's roll, and he saw certain things that were unprocedural, that were not in accordance with the voting rules, and there were other family members, and in the voter's roll there were nine people which whom we didn't know and we didn't know where they came from.   And at that time he told me that he was going to contact some legal people, who would be able to advise them as to what should be done with this voter's roll.   He called some other members of the Lamontville community, and drew their attention to the faults that were in the voter's roll.   And this came was taken to court.  When he got to court he won the case.  Then the election had to be redone, that's when he got votes, and he was elected as a councillor.  That is where all this started, the harassment and the altercations that followed thereafter, but because he so dearly loved the community, especially the youth in Lamontville.

And we tend to forget these sorts of things.   \nAnd one of the things that you mentioned in your evidence that your brother - in Lamontville  at the time was  this  process  of  unemployed  people being  sent away  from the urban  areas, and in our new young democracy we tend to forget the sorts of terrible pieces of  social engineering that the old government put in place to deal with people.  That process was known as section 29 of the Urban Areas Act.  And people, black people, who lived in townships like Lamontville and Chesterville  had a limited right to live in an urban area, and if they became unemployed for a certain period of time, if they in the government's terms if they lost their usefulness in an urban area, they could be sent away to a rural area that they may never have been to, that they may have never had contact with.   They were endorsed out of the urban areas if they became unemployed.  And many thousands, thousands and thousands of black South Africans were dealt with in this way.   \nThey lost their jobs in the city and they were endorsed out by the authorities, and many thousands of these people ended up as forced labour on farms in the Eastern Cape and in the Orange Free State.  \nAnd many thousands of people suffered in that way.  And it is one of the most degrading and hurtful pieces of social engineering that the old government ever implemented.   And it is one of the pieces of legislation that your brother fought very bravely against, and although he is dead, it - we hope it is of some comfort to you that many thousands of people in Lamontville and elsewhere regarded him as a hero.

There was a knock at the door.   She, Maggie, my wife, got up and opened the door and there was this young man stark naked except for his underpants and smeared all over with what oil with a pistol in his hands, which he fired at me, and missed from five paces.   Well, I ducked a little and the bullet went straight through the wall, because it was a wood and iron house, and as I say, the walls inside were made of asbestos sheeting.  And he turned around - it was an amazing sight, because I have seen many things exploding in my time, but I have never been in front of something going off like that, and there was quite a beautiful circle of lace like smoke, you know, and he was gone, and I thought, well I said I would be such and such, made a dive for the shotgun, which Maggie had tidied up and put it in the bedroom.

Now, I will backtrack a little bit and tell you what had happened.  This young fellow, Mike, the policeman, a very fastidious man and he had bought himself a very nice little used car, a Ford Escort, or something like that.   And that very day he had got himself a set of wheel trims for this car, and he and Wendy, the daughter, had spent the afternoon polishing this car, and he was taking a shower when the mother, Eunice, who was washing dishes in the kitchen and she looked out of the window and called to Mike, \"Mike, somebody is stealing your wheel trims\".   So, he rushed out from his shower with this towel around his waist into the back yard and there saw a car with all the lights off sort of slowly creeping down towards the back gate.  As I say, there was no gate on that entrance, creeping away, and there is one thing you should never do when there is any sort of policeman around and tiptoe about in a car with all the lights off.   So, he ran down after this thing on his bare feet and as he got to the gate the driver put on the brakes and there was the number illuminated, and he saw that this was a woman driving the car.

Well now the night before judgment was to be given in this trial of Jeffrey Wright, at a quarter to three in the morning my wife and I were asleep in a big double bed at the front of the house, when somebody fired over the gate with an assault rifle, firing fully automatic, and it is a dreadful sound, you know, rat a tat tat.  And there was the smell of explosives and the sound of splinters and bits of masonry flying all over and I pushed her out of bed with my foot, you know, she fell on the floor, and I said, \"Duck behind the wall\",  we had one masonry wall in this house, and we hid behind that while the bullets tore through this house.   Some of them went right through front to back, you know, and at that time my daughter was sleeping in the front room and my son was sleeping on the little verandah at the back.   Some of the rounds passed within half a metre, you know, or 50 centimetres of his head, and one of them could easily have taken him out, you see, but once again the police were around.

I was very distressed, especially  for my kids.   But we were all out in the street.   They collected a hand full of doppies and  cartridge cases, I think, eight  or  nine from here and there, there were others lying in the plants, for ballistic tests and we were looking for more out in the road where there I noticed an old club footed milkman, who for years and years been coming around at that time of the morning to deliver milk.  And he was standing looking at all this and he said to me, \"Are you looking for the people who shot over your wall?\", and I said, \"Yes\", and he said, \"They went that way in a green kombi\" and nobody thought of asking him when he was just the guy who delivered the milk, you know.   But everybody then questioned him and there had apparently been a pale green kombi which they leapt into and driven off in, you see, and it turned out - all this is as I remember being told, so I suppose it is hearsay, but I was told later that down at Morgan Naidoo's place a woman - shortly before the time of the shooting at our house, a woman had been cycling her restless baby on a balcony down in a block of flats in which Morgan Naidoo lived in, and there she saw men arrive also in a pale green kombi, and fire into his flat with a shotgun from such close range that one of the wads from the shell ended up inside his flat and the curtains, I think, were burnt or something like that.

I built up the front verandah.   I got a piece of ship's plate from the Bayhead and I welded up a sliding rack, so that, at night, we could slide this piece of steel across the front entrance to the verandah, with great ... (inaudible) ... padlocks at the bottom.  I put grenade screens on the windows.   I built the garden wall up to two metres and put a great heavy gate there.   And at the back verandah door where the shooting had taken place, I had built a screen wall so that nobody could shoot straight into the door and to come in, you would have to walk around this wall and all of that, you know, and we never stood in front of open windows, and it is not good for a kid.   And when that ended for him, some six/seven years later, he was due to go to the army now and get some more of it.   And he just disappeared.   He disappeared into Africa.

I mean MK could have learnt a couple of things from him, I  dare  say, but he  would be - he was all over Botswana;  Zimbabwe;  Malawi, where  he really got into smoking \"nsangu\", dagga, in a serious way.

I do want to underline the devastation that was caused not only on the individuals who were fighting against the system themselves, but on\n  their families.   We have listened with real horror to what can happen when children are deprived and abused in this way.   It goes on and on.   And I think one of our major problems in South Africa today in terms of crime, in terms of instability, has its roots in the wretched experience of hundreds and thousands of children.   I think that's probably one of the toughest things that one has to face.   The courage of those who were attacked and even killed is one thing.  To visit that upon the children, is another.\nThe only final concluding comment I want to make and I am hoping I am not going to be misunderstood, but I take that risk, the overwhelming majority of people who have suffered in this country and who have borne the brunt of the resistance are black South Africans.  Some times it is not a bad thing to remember that here and there were white people, Indian people, coloured people, who dared to pay the price as well in putting this together.   And I think the fact that we had an African woman, a white woman, Indian woman, white man, tell a very similar story, means that in the struggle we were together.   Let's hope, as we build the future, we will be together as well.  Thank you very much.\nThis session is now adjourned and will resume at 9 o'clock tomorrow, where, I understand, that tomorrow it is going to be women only and that doesn't mean that men can't come, but they will be the people who were bringing their witnesses will be a group of women, who were directly involved in the struggle.   I hope that as many of you as possible will join the commission tomorrow away and thank you again for your attendance.   It is very encouraging.   Thank you.\nPROCEEDINGS  ADJOURNED  TO  1996/10/25\n/PROCEEDINGS",
