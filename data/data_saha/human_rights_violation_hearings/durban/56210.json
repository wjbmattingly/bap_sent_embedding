He had a level of maturity far beyond his age.  Very early in his life he saw the injustices in South African society, and the degree to which all black people, including coloureds and Indians, were oppressed by the white Afrikaner minority.  So strongly did he feel about this issue that he refused to study Afrikaans, knowing full well that if he failed Afrikaans he would fail the entire examination and be forced to repeat standard 10.  He referred to Afrikaans as the language of the oppressor.  It was not surprising then to find that he received a conditional merit pass, failing Afrikaans outright with a G symbol.  ",

This inevitably involved politics.  He fully identified with the black students protests against the teaching in the medium of Afrikaans which culminated in the 1976 student uprising.  He saw that attempts to get the white government to change were futile.  He often told me that a nation that continued year after year to spend more money on military defence than on programmes of social uplift was fast approaching spiritual death.  He now began to talk in terms of a just war, and he was now inextricably involved in politics.  He would bring banned books home, books on Karl Marx, Fidel Castro, Martin Luther King, Chekhova, and so on.  In fact my own political enlightenment came from reading these books.   (Inaudible) ... Merewent Ratepayers Association, Merewent Ex-Students Society, Merewent Community Centre, Merewent Bus Passengers Association, the Natal Indian Congress, and also in the production of a community newspaper called The Sentinel, which had a strong political slant, evoking community consciousness on issues such as the bread price, workers' problems, etcetera.

It came to a stage when I was entrusted with the task of hiding the duplicating machine, which I did.  The Security Police then began harassing him at work.  They raided Dayglow Stationers in Durban, where he worked, and also the premises of Bargain Furniture in Beatrice Street, where he also later worked.  They kept a very close check on him, and even began monitoring his movements from home.  Due to the intensity of harassment he, together with a fellow activist, Vis Pillay, fled South Africa in August 1977.  Both of them entered Botswana illegally, but were arrested by the Botswana Police and detained.  When they proved that they were genuine refugees they were released after one night into the custody of the Refugee Committee in Botswana.  Later we learned that they had joined the military wing of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe.",

It was a school holiday and I was at home in the outbuilding.  The white man asked me if I knew where my brother Krishna was.  I told them that I didn't know.  He told me in a very sarcastic tone that we would never see him again.  When I asked him what he meant he replied that my brother had fled the country.  It was a great shock to me.  The Indian Security Branch policeman asked me if I too was involved in politics.  I replied in the negative.  He told the white officer that it would be a good idea to put the entire Rabilall along the front wall to face the firing squad.  They both laughed.

My parents, who were not highly educated - in fact my mother is totally illiterate - and therefore largely conservative as far as politics were concerned  were stunned with disbelief.  They had an inherent fear of white people, and to a very large extent I was conditioned by this fear myself.  My parents became depressed and began to age visibly.  I could see that they would never be the same jovial people that they once were.  My mother would often cry, especially in the evenings, because that was the time my brother would return from work, have his bath, and then my mother would bandage his arthritic knee.",

My brother wanted us to meet him in a secret venue in Swaziland.  My parents could not contain their excitement.  Despite our financial predicament my parents bought various items of clothing for him.  They prepared excellent food dishes to take to him.  The secret venue that we met was on the side of the road.  I think it was near a hotel in Swaziland.  But we had to wait for darkness before he arrived.  He was too scared to meet us during the day, and he never showed us where he lived in Swaziland.  In fact he stayed with us for those few days at the Timbali Caravan Park, which is a holiday resort in Swaziland.  When he jumped off the car my parents ran towards him and hugged him, shedding tears of joy at this temporary reunion.

            "We met in this clandestine fashion a few times between 1978 and 1981.  In this period Security Branch Police would often come home and harass my family, especially my mother, who was alone while the rest of us had gone to work.  They would want to know if we had received any communications from my brother.  This was a traumatic period for all of us, especially my mother.  It was obvious that the police were keeping tabs on all of us.  For instance, in January 1981 we made another trip to Swaziland to see my brother.  The officials at the border post gave us a torrid time.  They demanded to know why we were going to Swaziland.  They refused to believe that we were going on holiday.  They turned us back, saying that my son, who was two years old at the time, did not have a passport.  When my brother and I pleaded with them, saying that my son was a mere child who could not do anything wrong in Swaziland, they became abusive.  One of the chaps threatened my younger brother.  So we were forced to go back, but I knew that my mother and father were devastated by the fact that we had to go all the way back to Durban. Fortunately my wife suggested that I leave her and my small son at Piet Retief, so I drove at breakneck speed to Piet Retief, which was one hour's drive away from the border post, and here I found the greatest difficulty in obtaining accommodation for my wife and son in a predominantly conservative Muslim community.  There was only one Hindu family apparently in Piet Retief at that time, a Mr Singh, but he was not in town.  So I carried on driving around the town until one of the families took me in.  I then drove back again at breakneck speed, this time through lightning and thunder, to beat the 4 o'clock deadline at the border post.  The officer grudgingly allowed us to go through.",

            "I have described this incident in detail deliberately because this was the last time any of us would see my brother alive again.  In the same month after we returned from Swaziland, January 1981, I heard a knock on my bedroom window in the early hours of the morning.  Two of my brother's closest friends, who are here today, and I want to thank them for the moral support in coming here, had come to tell me that my brother had been killed by a South African Defence Force raid into Mozambique.  I was devastated.  I didn't know what to tell my parents.  My brothers and I eventually decided to lie to them that he was injured, and that we would be going to see him.  We were afraid that they would break down and not have the strength to go to the funeral.  We went by plane to Swaziland, and from there a car took us to Mozambique, but we were delayed for more than eight hours at the Mozambique border post, and I am convinced to this day that the South African Government had applied pressure on Mozambique to block our passage.  During our long wait at the border post we met other family members of some of the other 11 comrades who were also killed in the raid.  I think it was then that my parents sensed that we had spoken a lie to them, and that my brother was in fact killed and not really injured.  I could see the tears rolling down their faces.  It broke my heart, but we never spoke a word for the rest of the journey.",

There were several tear-gas canisters on the premises outside.  The SADF soldiers' faces were painted black, and we heard had bribed the Frelimo soldiers with alcohol and women then entered the building to look for survivors.  The level of brutality was evident all around.

We were shattered to hear that Griffiths Mxenge, who was the attorney handling the Mozambican raid by the SADF was murdered.  Worse was to follow, which I am now going to briefly relate.  In 1982 we heard a one-year memorial service at St Michael's Church in Merebank for the 12 comrades who were killed in the raid.  Victoria Mxenge and Paul David of the NIC were among the guest speakers.  Before we could start the church was surrounded by riot police.  They warned us to call off the memorial service.  Victoria insisted that we go ahead.  The service was almost nearing completion when the riot police invaded the church.  The major in charge had already apparently sent for reinforcements, and the church was now surrounded by Casspirs as well.  They capsized the prayer lamps and the candles that were burning, ripped off the posters and banners that hung on the walls, and confiscated the camera and video camera that were being used to record the event.  One policeman with a loud-hailer gave us three minutes to disperse, failing which he was going to give instructions to the rest of the police, who had their machine guns ready, to fire.  This created total panic, and the congregation of  mainly Indian and black people began to flee in all directions.  The riot police only left after everyone had gone.  It wasn't long afterwards that Victoria Mxenge was also killed.",

I will briefly relate the effect it had on me, because it symbolises what - the same kind of effect it had on other members of the family.  I became bitter towards white people, and the fact that the majority of them voted for the National Party election after election.  I could never understand how they could sleep easy with an easy conscience at night knowing that black children were dying in the homelands, when black people were given the most menial jobs, and that the Government they voted for used every conceivable kind of dirty trick and brutality to suppress the legitimate resistance of black people against the oppression of apartheid.  In short I became anti-white, and this attitude was reinforced by an incident I also had when I was travelling in a train to Durban.  I had accidentally walked into a white compartment, and the white conductor came and swore at me, called me a coolie, and told me as soon as the train stops at the next station I must get into the next coach, which I had to do.",

I then began to fantasize, and while this may seem laughable I sincerely prayed to God to make me invisible for just one day so that I could do the things I dreamed of, and when God did not comply I reduced the time to one hour, and in that one hour I was determined to go to Parliament and shoot every one cabinet minister.",

I admired people like Vic Turner, Neil Aggett, Joe Slovo and Beyers Naude.  I also realised that I wasn't being true to my religion if I hated somebody.

When they entered the bedroom they asked, they said they were looking for the comrades.  They started shooting suddenly.  Andile, who was sleeping, and the other two-year-old, woke up and cried - started crying.  When Andile woke up they had knives and they started stabbing, and they also had axes and they started chopping.  They started chopping them.  That's how he got injured, because they had stabbed him so brutally on the head.  The one who is next to me, the five-year-old, witnessed this.  This other one said, \"Don't leave me alone inside,\" because there were so many attackers.  These people were so many.  They had assegais and different weapons.  And also the other one said, \"We have the sister here, Phindile.  We do not know where Phindile is.\"  They started looking for Phindile in the house now.  With the assegais they were turning the house upside-down looking for Phindile.  And when Phindile realised and heard this she started crying, and they started shooting.  And they shot her under the bed.  They said, \"If you came out before we started shooting we were not going to shoot you,\" but they shot her there and they thought she had died already.  They left her and they took the other child with.  They went into the other bedroom.  My bedroom was locked, and they shot the door and the door fell.  They looked around inside and they took some of my possession in the house, in my bedroom.  We used to sell some paraffin, and they took money.  This child got into the cabinet to hide.  When they were approaching the door, trying to open the door to run away now - this child told me that they were so many, numerous in number, in the house attacking.  When they were opening the door they tried to break to burglar so they could escape, and they took the child with.  The child said, \"Don't leave me alone here because I am scared.\"  They said, \"No, you just go to this house.  There's a granny here you can stay with.\"  He went to this other house that he knew better than the other one that they were pointing him to.  They said, \"You go and disappear from us because you are going to get us into trouble.\"  He went to Mbatha's place and started to knock at the door, but they could not hear the knock.  He had to stay outside there by the door until dawn.  In the morning when the children were getting ready to go to school they saw him sitting outside.  They asked him, \"What's wrong?  Why are you sitting here?\"  The child related what happened about the attack, and also explained that he tried to knock at night but he wasn't heard.  They gave him some clothes to put on, and some food.  And Phindile, who was shot in the house then, she regained her consciousness and saw the other two-year-old, and the other one also who was stabbed from the head way up to the bottom, and she started calling Andile and Andile could not respond.  She realised that Andile was fatally injured, and the other two-year-old who was there was in blood.  The two-year-old was awake, seated right next to Andile.  He could not walk, and Phindile tried to get the child and crawled with the child a distance, trying to go to some other neighbours.  Blood was oozing from Phindile as she was trying to crawl along with the child as well.  And they went to the Khumalo's place.  They knocked and the lady responded.  They opened the door and she asked, \"What's happening?\"  Phindile related the story as to what happened.  That's where they spent the rest of the evening.  In the following day in the morning they tried to report the matter to the chief.  Phindile was so much in pains because she got shot, and the bullet penetrated throughout the body.  They went to ...

They accompanied him to his place.  They could see from a distance that the house was being looted, and the house was just upside-down, and they could see the burglar bars were fallen.  They went inside, they saw the house was upside-down up to the bedroom where the child was.  There was a police already from the chief.  They covered the child with a blanket.  When my husband got there he saw the child there.  The child was lying on the stomach.  He looked at the child and said, \"Well, it has happened.  I will accept it.  Please accompany me to the police to report this.\"  He went to King Edward, accompanied by these other police.  When he got there there were altercations also still.  They did not want to take his matter seriously.  They went back home and they took the child.  And he was taken to King Edward and he was taken to the Phoenix Mortuary.

If there could be a way, because even where we are now it's a three-roomed house, and the only reason why we managed to build this three-roomed house it's because of the relatives who helped so much with the expenses.

            "  Thank you.  Of course we come to this - you know, I come to the Commission as the spokesperson for my family, and whatever I am going to say will be a recollection of events surrounding the death and life and circumstances of my brother.  Firstly I was very pleased to hear of the establishment of the Truth Commission, and it was something that we prayed and hoped for for the last 10 years, and it has been actually almost 11 years since - or 10 years since I last saw my brother alive.  We always believed in truth and justice, and it was something that we always thought will - that truth and justice will always win, whether it's today, tomorrow, or in 10 years' time.  And it was this philosophy that really made me think about myself and look into myself after Lennie had died, and I asked myself, firstly, do I want justice - as we believed in this philosophy of justice and fair play?   Do I want justice to be served onto the wrongdoers, especially those that had administered justice the way they did to my brother, and the people of this country?  Do I want it to be meted out in the very same manner?  And there were times I wanted this type of justice, I wanted this jungle justice, blood for blood, and an eye for an eye, but fortunately there were times I wanted to learn the truth.  And those times that I wanted to learn the truth actually calmed me in my need for such justice.  Truth is what we all want, and truth I think is what we deserve now.  But the most soul-searching part comes after truth, and that is forgiveness.  I had to think long and hard about forgiveness.  I am still fighting with this.  It's not an easy battle.  There are times I seem to be losing - losing the battle.  At this time I am compelled to know the truth, but in knowing the truth I will obviously at one point in time have to forgive.  But what do I forgive, who do I forgive?  It seems this road of forgiveness, or this battle that I have with forgiveness seems to be a round going around in circles all the time.  Until this road straightens up perhaps I can forgive.  But through this Commission I hope that these perpetrators will give us the truth, and only the truth.  ",

I think it would have been basically based on the fact that Afrikaans being as a first language, and of course we never did Afrikaans as a first language medium.  And that I think started to make certain things grow in Lennie's mind.  He could see the discrepancies of the system in every way everywhere he looked.

And so I got home one afternoon - one evening, and there was this person there trying to talk to Lennie about this - you know, about giving himself up to the Security Branch, and apparently he said he knew people in the Security Branch, and he would make things easy for him.

We can only imagine what you and your family must have gone through to have to identify your brother, and your son, in the condition in which you found him.  He was a young person who, as you have said, devoted much of his younger life to doing voluntary work for others.  He became politicised, as was inevitable for an aware young person in those days.  He left the country.  If you just consider that if he had been arrested and charged according to the law in those days, charged for being a member of the ANC, charged for leaving the country unlawfully, or without a passport, there's no doubt that he would have been alive and free today.  But that's not how it happened in those days, and the overwhelming probabilities are - taking into account that both these groups died on different days in exactly the same circumstances, the overwhelming probabilities are that they were simply murdered, and placed - as I recall from those times - on top of each other in a prison cell, where you had to identify them.\nWe know that Mr de Kock and Mr Nafumela have applied for amnesty, and we will be having a very close look at those applications for amnesty to see whether they make full disclosure, as they are obliged to do, and to see what their version is of these events.  It is also possible that when de Kock gives his address in mitigation of sentence - as you know he's just been sentenced on 89 charges, including six of murder - when he gives his address in mitigation of sentence it is expected that he  will refer to other incidents, and that also may be some\nlead in to find out what happened in June 1988 to your brother, to your son.\nSo we thank you for having had the courage to have come forward here today and to have made the remarks you did about this Commission and its work.

But what was said during the trial is that there was a shopowner who was in the area that had been told of the incident months before, and he had circled it on his calendar, and he knew that it was going to happen because this man had told him that they were going to do this.  The youths at the time that carried out the attack with Mr Ngcobo apparently had no knowledge of what they were going to do.  It was said that some of them said they did know, some of they said they had some sort of idea, but weren't quite sure.  But the motive for the attack was that Mr Ngcobo said that he was doing this in order to show the rest of the white South Africans that Africa was here for the Africans, and that they wanted the white people to leave.

            "  Well, once we actually had the - once the trial was carried out, and the whole proceeding went through, they said that Mr Ngcobo had a - I don't know if you want to call it a psychological problem or a mental problem, but he was tried and he was put into - he wasn't - how to say - for example he wasn't put into prison, but he was going to go to a place where they would assess him.  I don't know if it's sort of like a mental prison or whatever.  But the actual youth that attacked me, and destroyed my life, was let off the hook.  He was - you know, I don't even know if that man was ever found.  No one ever said to me - no one ever approached me and said to me, \"The man who did this to you, or the boy who did this to you, you know, this is who he is, this is why he did it, and this is what's going to happen to him.\"  The proceedings in the - we went to court.  Firstly I had to go to Westville Prison to testify - not to testify, to go to an identification parade.  They contacted me and asked me - or told me I needed to come, and they said to me at the identification parade I'd be sitting behind a glass window, I need not to be afraid.  If I just saw anyone that I recognised or knew all that I needed to do was to point them out.  Well, I spent the entire day at Westville Prison, and by the time I actually got to go and do my identification of the so-called perpetrators I had to walk through the actual prison itself, and I went into the chapel at Westville Prison, and to my absolute amazement there was no glass window.  I was standing face to face with a group of 50 men, which I had no idea who were the people that had attacked me.  I did not see my attacker's face.  All I knew was that he was young and he had a peach shirt on.  So I recognised Mr Ngcobo.  I saw him standing there, he had a blue robe on, but at that time I was in such a state, because they had told me that I wouldn't worry about having to be seen, and I went in there - I didn't have - I had the support of a policeman I didn't even know, and I went in there and was faced with all these people.  And I started to cry because I was afraid, and I wasn't prepared for this, and as I started to cry so the prisoners started laughing and throwing - and shouting comments, and so that was - it was a waste of time because I couldn't even look at the guys and try and see who the man was.  But we did go through the prosecution, and unfortunately Captain Hurter, who was the detective at the time, was killed in a car accident.  I don't know how it happened, or what happened at the time, but once he actually - once he died it just seemed the case just kind of took a back seat.  It went through to proceedings, I testified, and afterwards - I'm sure you all have probably seen in the papers that there were two men that were found guilty, and Mr Ngcobo himself.  But those were only three men.  What happened to the other five?  There were eight of us stabbed, not three, and the perpetrator who - the man who attacked me and did what he did to me, why should he get away - why should he get away with it?  He may have",

I did see psychologists, I went to doctors, but I felt that none of that really helped, because what I needed to do was I needed to get a grip of the situation and I needed to accept what had happened.  It was no use getting someone to try and talk me around the situation.  I needed to face the situation and say, \"Well, it's happened.  There's nothing I can do.  I am just going to have to accept that it happened and get over it.\"  But you must realise that, although a person can forgive other people what had happened a person will never forget.  I was 15 at the time, I was very young.  I was still moving into my teenage years, I was still learning to become a young adult, and after something like that happens you just - about what, five, six, seven, eight years, you just seem to mature overnight.  You've got to handle a situation which only you can face.  There's no one else that's going to help you face that situation.

You try to do that.  You try and forgive and forget, and luckily I'm a christian, so I have been able to have one counsellor, and I think that counsellor is the only counsel I do need, because if I've got this far I am sure that I don't have to worry about anything coming up because the worst is behind me.

On a particular Thursday morning we received a telephone call, and my elder sister went to answer the phone.  It was a certain Mr Gwenza Mlaba who had phoned, and he is an attorney.  He said we should come to his office.  My elder sister went to his office and she was told that Makhosi and eight other people had died.   Amongst them was Lennie Naidu, as well as Malindi Mthembu.  It was Makhosi Nyoka, as well as Lindiwe Mthembu, Glenrose Xothoza, Jabulani Sibisi, Sifiso Nxumalo, Boxer Mthembu, Lennie Naidu, as well as Sifiso Thenjwayo.",

Then in the same evening, when the neighbours child had come to play, I was asked to take him back to his place and help him cross the street.  When I got out of the yard I saw a white kombi parked before the yard, in front of the yard, and when I came back from taking the child halfway I was accosted by four boers, who asked me as to where my sister was.  And I told them that she was not there.  They asked me whether I had heard that she had died, and they asked me as to how I got to know that, but I never told them.  And they accompanied me into the house.  They went around the house, and there were certain black people who were wearing Balaclavas, and they said to me I should tell the people inside the house to come out of the bedrooms and sit in the dining-room, and that I should ask one of the people inside the open the door.   And they got into the house.  They sat down and they asked as to who was the eldest.  We said we were alone, because my father had died by then, and they asked me as to where my sister was.  They told me that they were seeing Mlaba's work.  They were the ones who had killed Mlaba.  We told them that we did not know anything about anyone who killed anyone.  They showed us certain photos.  They showed the photos of our sister, as well as other people who had died.  They were all naked, and they said we should point out my sister, but her photo was not amongst the photos that we were shown.  He actually asked me as to how I could not identify my own sister, and this other boer showed me my sister's photo.  I could not identify her because of the injuries that she had sustained on the face.  They actually showed me my sister on the photo.  From there they went away.  When one of them went out the other one came in and said they are going to get even the others.  They were going to get them one by one and kill them and finish them just like the others.  And they then went away.  Thereafter we went to see attorneys, and we were at the same time preparing for the funeral.  My sister woke up the following morning and went to the offices.  My brother also went to make some funeral arrangements, and during the day these boers came and asked me as to when we were going to bury my sister.  I told them that my elder brother, as well as sister were not around, so I could not answer them.  I did not know anything about the funeral.  When neighbours came to comfort us during our moment of grief they were chased away by the boers, and they could not stay and comfort us during that moment.  Then on a particular Friday the boers came back.  We were at a night vigil, my sister's night vigil, and the neighbours were afraid to come and attend the night vigil because the boers had come and parked their cars in front of our yard, thereby preventing the neighbours from gaining entry.  Then on Saturday it was the funeral.  My sister was buried.  Thereafter the attorneys phoned and said we should come and institute some civil action, as well as criminal proceedings.  My sister is in Kimberley, and most of the time she was not at home.  So they went together with the other bereaved families of the deceased.  They went to see Yakoob and Moerane, and when they came back they related to us, and we were told that amongst the killers that was Eugene de Kock, as well as Nofumela.  Then after some time they went back and they were told that the case was postponed, and when the case was finalised I was told by my sister that the Judge had said he fears for his life, then he will not announce the conviction, he will not convict the accused people, but he will pass the matter on to Pretoria.  He reserves his judgment.  Thereafter nothing went on.",

            "  Since I was a dressmaker I will be just working from home, and that's how we survived.  We could make ends meet because of what I was doing as a dressmaker.  He will go to get some pills and sell them, and watches, selling those.  And that's how we managed to live.  Time went on, and they were bothering him.  They will always come, Twala and others that I did not know, coming to check on him.  That was the life we were leading and he was leading.  Time went.  On March 18th at night Blackjack, Mr Khumalo from Lamont office, came.  As a person we knew we could not suspect anything.  He went outside the house to meet him, and we did not know - little did we know that there were Special Branch with Khumalo, and they took him with.  I thought they were going to talk, you know, men's talk outside, to converse as men.  I did not know - we were not aware inside the house that there were some Special Branch with Khumalo outside.  I was thinking they were still talking outside and yet they had already taken him.  I don't know where they took him to.  On Friday morning my son came.  He had gone to see - visit his wife, and I told him that, \"Khumalo came last night and they took your father.  You must go and look and see what is happening.\"  He was a building contractor.  He will go to Umlazi.  That's where he was working as a builder.  That very Friday morning van Zyl and Taylor and Makhanya came.  I have their names in my bag.  I think there were four or five.  They came to search the house, and they could not gather anything.  They also searched our son's room.  They could not see anything.  And van Zyl said, \"I'll fix him today.\"  I said, \"What did you see here?  What did you find from your searching?  Why would you say those things and swear that you will fix him?\"  He said if he was the one who was going to sentence him he was going to sentence him three years.  But he was fortunate because he was not the one, this is why he got one year sentence.  He said he was going to fix him, and then they left.  I said to myself, \"Take some clothes with so you can give my husband,\" because he was not warmly dressed.  He just had raincoat.  He did not have pyjamas on, although after that they changed and said he had his pyjamas on.  It was not pyjamas, it was raincoat.  I said, \"Since he was wearing a raincoat please won't you take some clothes with,\" and I tried to get some clothes for him, decent clothes for him, so in case he goes to the court of law he can appear decently dressed.  He never got to wear those clothes.  They took those clothes with.  Saturday, the following day in the morning, one person came.  He said, \"What's happening with Mdluli?\"  I told him what happened, and he said, \"It looks like he has died.\"  I said, \"No, I don't think so.  Van Zyl should come here and tell me if he has died or what.  I cannot take stories from people.\"  He left, that person left.  Another one came and told me the very same thing.  I said, \"Who are you and where are you coming from?  If Mdluli has died van Zyl and Taylor and the others should come and tell me.  Mdluli left this place and he was just fine, healthy and intact.\"  And the neighbour came, Mrs Njo, and she said, \"Let's go.\"  I think they were not free to tell me because they already knew what had happened.  She said, \"Let's go to town to Mxenge.\"  I don't remember if I responded to that, but we did go.  We got to Mxenge's office Saturday morning.  There was no one, but Mxenge was there alone.  He was just there looking as if he was writing, and two gentlemen approached, David Gaza and George Sithole.  And they came in sort of talking, you know, something that was not so much serious.  I think they knew they were not free.  They were scared of telling me the truth.  I don't know how far this went.  I think there was a car which took me to the mortuary.  I don't remember.  I don't remember whether I started home first before I went to the mortuary, but we went to the mortuary eventually, and I asked, \"What do we want here?\"  They said, \"Well, we shall search all over, even here at the mortuary, because he has disappeared.\"  And we were there searching, looking around, and I could tell that they were playing around with me, just fooling with me.  We went back home, and I saw many people at home.  And Mxenge suddenly came as well and he asked, \"How \"did you go where you have gone to?\"  I said, \"Mdluli was not there.\"  And he said, \"He ought to be there.  Let's go.  Come along with me.  Let's go and look for him.\"  We went with Mxenge and some others that I cannot recall their names.  We got there.  He said a few words.  Because they knew that he was an attorney they respected him, and one white gentleman came and opened the door, and we found him there in a green box, in a green coffin.  He was swollen.  He was swollen in that glass box.  I don't know what they did to him, and Mxenge interrogated them.  And we went back home.  The Special Branch never stopped coming to my place, but this van Zyl never appeared after that.  Only strange policemen kept coming, also and the journalists.  Reporters kept coming to my place.  They will just come and ignore and dismiss every single thing I tried to say, and I kept calling for van Zyl.  Moran Moore(?) tried all he could to be of assistance.  Each time I say something Jimmy Kruger answers and responded.  Each I time I send messages to the newspapers, and comments to the newspapers, van Zyl kept commenting.  Time went on.  One Sunday one of the funeral scheme people came, and Mxenge had already taken him to the King Edward Mortuary then.  He was already there.  This funeral scheme of Umlazi said they did not like the idea of him being in that mortuary, they would like him to be at the central - central mortuary just around here in town.  I will remember, I have just forgotten.  That's Prince Edward.  They were asking me if they could change him and transfer him from the other mortuary to Prince Edward Central Funeral.  I agreed to that because I knew them, and I also had my own funeral scheme as well as them.  Monday morning they said I shall go and transfer him from the other mortuary to King Edward - to King Prince.  Truly we went there and the white man refused, kept arguing.  He said I cannot transfer the corpse.  I explained to him that I had to.  He kept arguing and disagreeing, and some boys who were there said, \"You must insist.  Just be adamant.  You must get him out of this mortuary.\"  Finally he agreed, and we went to Prince Edward, and they transferred him.  I said, \"Now that he will be transferred from this mortuary to the other I would like to see him.\"  Truly I saw him.  His body was wounded brutally.  He was going to be buried on the 27th March, and I said, \"No, he should not be buried then, because if I say something they are going to refute that.  I'll see when we will bury him, but not yet.\"  They agreed.  I wanted experts who were going to get pictures of this corpse.  The Indians listened to me.  I went back home.  They did all the arrangements, made all the arrangements, and they got the expert to take the pictures, and that was professionally done.  I was satisfied.  Soon after that those photos were sent or mailed overseas.  I did not know who did that, and they kept accusing me that I was in charge, I knew everything, and I am the one who mailed - posted those photos overseas.  I went to the men, I asked them, \"Did you do that job and taken those pictures good - professionally?\"  They said yes.  I said, \"Now I am satisfied.  We can have the funeral now.  I have this as evidence, the pictures.\"  I said, \"On the 3rd we will bury him.  No one will deny any act because I have this evidence of pictures with me.\"  On the 1st April Archbishop Hurley sent me some money and said I should go to the boutique and buy myself beautiful clothes.  On the 2nd we went to the city centre and we started - first went to see the attorneys first, and we proceeded - went to the boutique and we bought many clothes, and we took some to Mxenge's place.  After that the boers came to Mxenge's place and they said they were already coming from Lamont, and they said to Mrs Mxenge, \"Where is she?\"  Mrs Mxenge told them that I am around, but I am still in town.  When we were trying to do the final touch-up one person came and told us that the boers were looking for us, and we went there to see what was happening.  And they asked me why am I - why did I do what I did, taking pictures of the corpse and sending them overseas?  I said, \"I don't care.  Leave me alone.  And those pictures belong to me.  It's part of my possession, it's none of your business.  Mdluli is mine, my husband, and the pictures belong to me as well.\"  As we were still having these altercations and so forth my son came driving his car.  When he got there he asked, \"Where is my mum?\"  They told him that, \"Your mum is in that office with boers.\"  He said, \"Oh, are those boers the ones who came home?\"  He went.  He just pushed the door and got inside and pulled me out, and said, \"Mum, get out of this office and carry on with your funeral arrangements.  Leave these boers alone here.\"  We went back home.  It was the final day now, Friday.  We were making the final touch-ups, and people were flocking in, coming in from different places and different countries.  I was already coming from Sydenham.  There were some Indians of that place who were assisting with groceries for the funeral.  They donated many things.  The boers were all over.  They kept coming to my house even at night, frequenting my house, patrolling.  And I have relatives in Johannesburg.  They arrived as well, and the boers refused them entry.  And they asked, \"Why won't we come in?  Why won't you let us -give us entry?\"  They said, \"No, no one will come in,\" but they forced their way in.  Finally they did come inside.  The following day it was the funeral day.  They installed tape records in the hall, and that hall was surrounded with tape records.  People came in, and some others were seated on top of the wall because there was not enough space.  They tried to stop people from coming in now, but people refused and they were insisting their way in.  The boers tried to stop them from coming in.  Mrs Mandela as well came, flew in.  And we went on, we buried Mdluli.  After that I never had peace of mind at home up until this day.  They did all sorts of things.  Each time I would send some comments to the newspaper, talking to van Zyl, and Jimmy Kruger will respond.  And some boers came at night to tell me that they received a message that Jimmy Kruger said there will be a prominent person who will be flying in the morning.  It was June then, winter time.  Six will strike at night.  And I had to go to Ulundi to meet that prominent person who was bringing a message for me from Jimmy Kruger.  And the messenger said I should keep quiet, and if I have anything to say I must say it to him in person and stop sending messages to the newspapers.  They spoke to my sister.  I had locked the house.  My sister kept asking them questions, and they said, \"Whenever she comes back please tell her that at 6 o'clock we'll come to fetch her to the airport to explain to this prominent person and say her claim.\"  My sister opened the window and said, \"Are you there, my sister?\"  I said, \"Yes, I am here.\"  She said, \"Did you hear everything that was being said here?\"  I said, \"Yes, I heard everything from A to Z.\"  She said, \"You locked yourself inside deliberately?\"  I said, \"Yes, I did that deliberately.\"  I said, \"I heard everything.\"  She said, \"They told me that you were not in.\"  I said to her, \"But I am inside.  I just did not want to open the door for them.\"  She said, \"You must know then tomorrow morning at six you have to go with them to the airport because they are coming to fetch you.\"  I said, \"I am not going.  I cannot be having my attorney and still do my own things without consulting my attorney.  I am not going anywhere.\"  She asked me, \"What are you going to do?\"  I said, \"At 5 o'clock I will wake up and leave.\"  Truly at 5.00 am I woke up, I went to Mdluli's place in the neighbourhood.  They went to my sister again.  They said they don't know why I keep doing these things because they have explicitly emphasised the fact that I shall be taken to the airport and meet Jimmy -and talk to this person who has been sent by Jimmy Kruger, and I should know the fact that the attorneys are not going to help me, but Jimmy Kruger is going to help me.  My sister told them that, \"She is not here, and there is nothing I cannot do.\"  I saw them from where I was at Mdluli's place leaving the place, and then I went back home after they have gone.  I did not know how far these things went, but after some time - you see, I was not safe, and there would be marauders who will come to place frequently with weapons and so on.  Jimmy Kruger wrote and sent the comments to the newspaper, and said \"Lydia has gone overseas with Masondo.\"  Masondo was in Robben Island then, and the comments were saying, \"Lydia had left the \"country, and just when I was trying to fix her claims up she left, she decided to leave the country with Masondo,\" the Masondo who was in Robben Island, but originally coming from Soweto.  And we left the country for America, for overseas.  Moran Moore came and said, \"Did you see the newspaper?  Did you see what has been written here?\"  He showed it to me and asked me, \"Get dressed.  Get dressed and get some baskets and I'll take your pictures.\"  I had my basket and he said, \"There is Mrs Mdluli going to the market,\" and after that Jimmy Kruger never sent any messages or comments to the newspapers.  The Mercury newspaper said, \"There goes Lydia to the market place.\"  I have forgotten a lot of things.  Please pardon me for this.  These things transpired a long time ago, 20 years back, so I have forgotten a number of things.",

(incomplete - end of side A) ... by heart attack, and Dr Chris Barnard responded and said they were not telling the truth, he will come and exhume the body.  They are lying.  They kept quiet after that.  I was called to the court of law in Pietermaritzburg.  They said I should come and explain about the pictures that I had sent overseas, because this was an insult to them.  I took Phyllis Naidoo with.  When we got to Pietermaritzburg they said my son shall come in first and explain the pictures.  Unfortunately my son did not know a thing inasfar as the pictures were concerned, and the prosecutor of Pietermaritzburg said it's my son who wounded the corpse, and now they are saying it's them - and now it looks as if it was them, and that's not true.  I said, \"That's not true,\" and my son said, \"Mum, come along with me.  They are not telling the truth inside.  They are just saying their own things.\"  I went inside the court of law, and one white lady brought many pictures, photos, and put them on the table, and said I should pick my photos.  I did that.  I picked about four or five photos and I left the rest.  And they said, \"Those are yours?\"  I said, \"Yes.\"  And they asked what had happened to them.  I told them, \"I took these pictures so that tomorrow these can serve as evidence against anything that will be said.  Now you are telling me about the heart attack, and there is no heart attack which can cause wounds on the body and injuries on the body,\" and they kept quiet.  I have forgotten some other things although, but I did not have peace of mind after that.  I was being bothered up to this day, and I had no house after that.  In Lamontville I had a wonderful time.  I had never had any altercations with people around.  The mayor wrote a letter and said I was behaving so well in Lamontville, and said wherever I'll go he had that in writing, saying wherever I'll go I shall be given a house because my behaviour is so exceptionally well.  He had never seen anything or ill things that I have committed before.  I was always a good citizen.  He said I had never had anything that I was commenting or accusing people about, I was always a peaceful person.  I have forgotten other things.  The case went on in 1979 - 1979, March.  Before the case started - I think it was Saturday - I had visited Mxenge.  I was at Mxenge's place.  We got a telephone message and they said they will ask Lydia to be present on Saturday, to come on Saturday.  The case will be on Monday.  Truly we went there on Saturday, and they said, \"We do admit that we killed him.  That did happen, but now we would like you not to come and not to stand, because we have already admitted.  We'll give you whatever you want,\" because I had asked for R39 000,00.  When we got there on Monday they gave me a R10 000,00 cheque, which I did not know what to do with it.  That R10 000,00 got finished.  It's more than 20 years ago now.  All what this means is that they are owing me, especially Jimmy Kruger, because each time I will say something in the newspaper he will respond every time without fail.  This tells me that Jimmy Kruger is owing me R30 000,00.  What I am saying, I want that money, for he is owing me, and he deceived me with a R10 000,00 cheque because I am illiterate.

He died whilst he was in the custody of the Security Branch.  And these are people who should have upheld the law, but instead they often did the opposite, and harassed, tortured and murdered people.  We note from what you have said that one of the people who helped to find your husband's body was the lawyer, Griffiths Mxenge, and he in turn was also brutally murdered by the police some time after that.

And she told me that I shouldn't pay much attention to it, probably the line would be working later on.  Then we went to sleep.  In the middle of the night we saw torches and we heard loud knocks at the door.  A white man came in wearing a khaki coat, and he asked as to where Thami was, and we told him that he's asleep.  He went into the house and sat on the bed, and we woke each other up.  But Thami was the last to be seen, and he directed Thami to dress up.  And he went to a certain suitcase that had Thami's clothes, and there were certain photos that they used to take when they were on their tours with the choir, and they asked him as to how he got a certain photo, and Thami said he got this photo at the seaside.  They took him with, and they wanted to take the radio as well as cassettes that were there.  And they wanted to know what was happening in those organisations, so they took the cassettes as well as the record player.  They put these in a pillowcase.  They handcuffed him and they took him with to the car.  Thami got into the car that was behind the other one.  We went to C R Swart and we sat there up until the following morning.  And on the following morning they brought an exercise book.  They wanted to test our handwritings, and they asked us certain questions.  At that time there was a certain white person who was wearing a white safari suit - I don't know what his name was - and he would fire us with questions with regard to certain organisations.  And if you do not answer satisfactorily, or in the manner that he wanted you to answer, he would hit and assault us with an open hand on the face.  And apparently Thami did not want to disclose any information, and he was told that he was going to explain certain things.  There was a certain photo.  In this photo they used to take - especially the  youths who used to skip the country used to have Thami's photos, and they would always show this photo in order to gain entry or to leave the borders of South Africa, and certain youths were caught with this photo of Thami, and this is what caused all the problems.  After they had interrogated us they brought us food, but Thami didn't want to eat at that time.  And they said to me they had discovered that I was innocent, and I was supposed to go back home.  And I was not satisfied.  I wanted to ask them to let me see my brother so that I could bid him goodbye, and they asked me as to why I was saying that.  I told them that I had no hope of seeing my brother in future, because they had killed a certain Mr Mdluli and they would probably do the same to my brother.  They told me that they would not do anything to my brother.  They forced me to go home.  Then on the following day I heard that my brother was dead.  They said he had hanged himself.  When we went to see him he had a scratch or a laceration on the neck, and they said, \"This is the laceration that resulted from him hanging himself.\"  Then I went to Gale Street.  When I got to Gale Street with the death certificate they put me in an empty office and they kept on talking to each other.  And I went to the reception to inquire as to why I wasn't being attended to.  They told me that I had to go to C R Swart to submit this death certificate.  I went there, and I never got any information as to how Thami died and I never got the death certificate.",

There's a long, long list of people who fought against apartheid and who died in detention.  I can think of people like, in the sixties, Immam Haroon and Ahmed Timol, Joseph Mdluli, who we heard about today, Steve Biko, Neil Aggett, Dr Hafferjee in Pietermaritzburg, and there are many, many more, and the police gave different reasons for how they died, ridiculous reasons.  They jumped out of windows, they fell over chairs, they slipped on pieces of soap.  But we know that they didn't die in those ways.  Most of these people were murdered by the police.  You've said that you believe that your brother was murdered.  We'll never ever actually know for sure.  It is even possible that he committed suicide, but we must ask ourselves what drove him to commit suicide, what caused him to commit suicide, if indeed he did commit suicide?  So it's not really important whether he was murdered or whether he committed suicide, because if he committed suicide things must have been so terrible for him in detention that he was forced to take his own life.  And it is the system that killed him one way or another, and if he had not been detained without trial he would have been alive today, and we must never - we must guard against that sort of system every being introduced in this country again, where people are detained without access to their families and lawyers and doctors.",

Because of the situation that was there my wife, together with the children, decided that she should not sleep at home because it was not safe.  There was a faction fight between ANC and Inkatha.  They wanted members.  My wife ran to Nkanga, where there was a Dlomo family, who is my cousin.  They slept at that house.  Because the children had to go to school the following morning they woke up very early the following morning, and she was preparing for the children to go to school.  Before they even got home they were followed by certain men.  According to the children they said these were three men who were wearing Balaclavas.  They started shooting them.  My wife was shot at that time, and she fell in front of the yard.  My twins were also shot, Thulisile and Thulile.  They were shot in the legs.  The elder daughter managed to run away, and she hid herself behind the trees.  Thulile and Thulisile also followed suit, they went to hide with their sister.  They hid there for quite some time, and they were waiting for the people to disappear.  Thereafter they proceeded home.  That's where Xolisile went.  She took a shawl and she went to cover her mother.  And my neighbour, who had a shop, went and took the twins, Thulile and Thulisile.  Thulisile had been shot in the leg only.  Thulile has got a wound just below the scapula, as well as on her right leg.  After this had happened the police got a message, the Isipingo police got a message, and they went to fetch my wife's corpse to the mortuary.  Apparently they were sent by my son, Mduduzi, because he also nearly died because he had slept at a certain house opposite the Dlomo family, and he was following them.  When this was happening he was behind his sisters, and when he heard gunshots he realised that his mother, as well as his sisters, were injured and he went back to raise the alarm, because the police in Isipingo came to fetch the corpse.  After they had been discharged from the hospital - I asked the hospital to discharge them because I wanted them to come back to their mother's funeral.  This happened on the 13th, and that weekend went past.  The following weekend I asked for them to be released so that they could come to their mother's funeral.  The police took the statement.  Thulile also submitted a statement.  I took the children to the police, and that was the end of the matter.  I was never filled in as to what has happened.  That's why I have come before this Commission.  Thank you.",

We just heard a voice, a screaming voice, screaming and shouting - and shouting and saying, \"Brother-in-law, brother-in-law, I am dying.\"  We got out to see what was happening, because we could identify that it was his voice.  We could not speak and talk to him because he was already lying by the gate.  When we were looking we saw a group of young men running away, far away.  We could not even chase them or run after them.  We wanted to attend to the one who was lying down.  Suddenly his sister and the husband suspected he had died already.  They were whispering.  They did not want me to hear that.  They rushed to look for a car, and it was late, the car could not - we could not take him into the car, but the police vehicle came.  He was just stabbed once.  There were not many wounds, just on the left-hand side.  It did not look like he was stabbed by a knife, it looked like it was a screwdriver.

            "It was actually from 1987.  My son was attending school at Umbuzana, and his name was Sifiso.  He was from Umathiwe, and when he got to Umbuzana in the middle of the year, whilst he was still attending school, there was a certain kombi that used to come to his school, and it used to follow them, together with his friends Fano and Mbuso and another group of youths.  And they used to ask them whether they were still continuing in that school, because members of the UDF were not accepted at that school.  And they denied this, they said they were not affiliated to any political organisation.  And these people told them that they should go back to where they belong because they were not accepted.  Each time there were certain people who used to come to their school, and they would call them, say they wanted to talk to them, until they got a certain hole through which they used to escape whenever these people came to their school.  And these people used to accost them and ask them about being members of the UDF, and they kept on denying these claims.  And at some stage the drivers of this car wanted to take them and put them into the car, and they related the matter to us that there was this car which kept on chasing them.  I said it was towards the end of the year, and he was going to change the school the following year, so he should continue for that particular year.  And in the neighbourhood there was a certainly family called the Dlamini family.  They made a meeting and they said all male children should go to that meeting.  We refused our children permission to go there.  We said we did not have any weapons, and we were told that they had a lot of weapons, they would not run short of weapons.  All we should do, we should send our sons there.  And thereafter we kept on being checked on by the members of Inkatha, because they were telling us that we had sons and we did not want to send them to the meetings of Inkatha.  And we ended up sleeping in the garden now because they always used to come, especially in the middle of the night.  At times we would sleep in the garden, wake up the following morning, get into the house and wash, go to work, and the children would go to school.  In the evening we would come back, have supper, and go and sleep in the garden.  On a particular day two buses came, and we heard people saying the Inkatha had arrived, and we went back into the garden where we used to sleep.  My husband said he was now tired of running away and he would sleep in the house.  He would run away when he heard them coming.  I saw them coming and I ran into the house.  I knocked on the window to warn my husband that the Inkatha people had come.  I knocked violently on the window, and my husband woke up and he ran into the garden.  We hid ourselves there.  Life went on like that, because we used to sleep in the garden.  We decided to go and look for a certain place called Congo, and we took our clothes with and we went to look for a shack.  We hired a shack, and this shack was a one-roomed shack.  We just wanted to be safe so that we could not sleep outside any more.  And at that time we believed that at the shacks we would not be known as to where we came from.  We stayed there, and the family was quite big for a shack.  And each time we went back home we would be told that there was a certain car that was moving around asking as to our whereabouts.  And at that time I had taken Sifiso to Impendle, and I was left with two girls and Sithembiso, who was very young at that time.  We stayed at those shacks, and we experienced problems because they were stealing at the shacks and they were breaking into the shack.   And we went to ask as to what the situation was like.  Apparently it looked calm at that stage, and we decided to go back to our house.  We went back together with the children, and we stayed there, and it was in 1989 by then.  We stayed for quite a short while and we realised that it looked as if the situation was calm and it was safer later on.  And I brought Sifiso, because each time Sifiso came back people would come and ask about him, that he had come, and I would always deny that he was there.  Then on a particular night in 1989 we heard a knock.  It was 11.00 pm in the evening.  But we were still somehow scared.  We heard somebody knocking at the door at 11 o'clock, and I could gather that these people were many.  It was not only one person.  My husband wanted to go and open the door, but I restrained him and I told my husband that I should be the one to open the door.  I went to open the door.  When I got to the door I saw a certain man.  His name is Mr Sibiya.  I saw Mr Sibiya.  He had a big gun, as well as an assegai and a knobkerrie.  We greeted Sibiya, and my husband also greeted Sibiya.  And Sibiya took only two steps towards us in the dining-room, and at some stage he put down his weapons and he said, \"Sithole, I do not want to get into your house with weapons.\"  At that time we were scared because the children were asleep, but we felt - we suspected something and we asked him as to what he wanted.  He told us that we should not be scared, he had come to look for Fano, and Fano was my son's friend and he was also suspected of being a member of the UDF.  On the day that Sibiya had come Sifiso was at home on that day, and he was going to go back to the rural areas the following morning, and they were hiding in the bedroom at that time together with his friend Fano.  He said that he knew that Fano was at our place, but my husband said Fano is not there, but in reality he was there but we had hidden him.  And they said they wanted Fano, and they had seen that Fano had come to our place.  My husband denied that Fano was around, and Sibiya said, \"It is fine if he is not there,\" and we told him that they had gone to the rural areas, and we denied that Fano was around.  We said Fano had gone with his mother to his mother's workplace.  Sibiya then took his weapons and he decided to go out.  I closed the door.  Just as Sibiya was getting out I peeped through the curtain in the dining-room to see as to who he was with. And Sibiya did not fight when he came, he just said he was looking for Fano, and when I peeped through the curtain I saw so many people surrounding our house.  They were even more than the people who are in this hall today.  All of them were having guns and weapons, as well as knobkerries.  I stood there in the dining-room and I looked through the curtains, and I heard Sibiya talking at the door.  And this person asked as to why Sibiya did not kill Sithole, and he said he was not going to kill Sithole because he was sent to go and ask for the key so that they would get a way of killing Sithole.  The others said they would not kill my husband because Sibiya had failed to kill my husband.  He said he was not directed to kill Sithole, but he was directed to look for the boys, and they said Sibiya was selling them out.  And they said to him he was an ANC member, why did he not want to kill Sithole.  Had he shot Sithole, Sithole would probably have told them where the boys were.  I once more opened the door because I did not feel safe.  I went into the bedroom.  I told them that they must take a different direction.  They must get underneath the bed and we were going to sit on top of the bed.  We wanted to hide them.  And these people went away.  They were followed by a certain car, a kombi, but I am not sure of the colour of the kombi.  I could not even see the registration plate, because I did see that it was the kombi that the boys had told me about.  They went around a certain corner, an we had already heard them asking Sibiya as to why he did not kill my husband.  At 5 o'clock the following morning I told them to pack and go without even washing.  I accompanied them.  I gave Fano some money to go because his mother was not around.  I gave him money and told him he should go with my son to the rural areas.  Then on the following day I phoned to inquire as to whether they had arrived.  It was confirmed that they had arrived.  After about a week after Sifiso as well as his friend had gone we saw certain people passing in front of my house at about 11, and they kept on saying they had seen Mr Sithole's house before.  And I was listening to them at that time, and I told my husband that we should go and hide, they would not kill the children, they would have mercy on the children.  We hid ourselves underneath a peach tree.  That's correct.hey went past, they never got into the yard up until they went to Sibiya's place.  They were so many.  It was a large group.  Then on the following week very late at night, at about 11 - my husband was working night shift, and whenever he was  working night shift I used to sleep with the children.  Dudu was sleeping with me, and we slept in one room because we were scared.  And we heard some footsteps outside, but nobody was knocking or coming in.  At about half past 11 I could hear the sound of shattering glass.  That was in the bedroom.  My child's uniform was hanging there, and I could hear something hitting me, and I asked myself as to what had taken the uniform from its hanging place.  I woke the children and we put the lights on.  I picked the uniform up and I put it into the wardrobe.  Then I decided to get dressed, and we stayed there.  I was dressed during the night.  At about 1.00 am, at dawn, I saw a gun, the front of a gun, pointing at our heads, and I heard them say, \"We have now come.  You think you are brilliant.\"  I looked at this person.  He was very dark.  I had never ever seen him before.  He said we thought we were clever.  I realised that this was a gun I threw myself down and I lied flat on the floor, and I directed my children to lie down on the floor.  Some of them got underneath the bed.  Now the bedroom was opened.  They started firing at us.  He shot for the second time, and when he shot for the third time we started screaming.  We could hear some gunshots at the dining-room door, and we decided to scream and not go in that direction.  They kept on shooting through the window, and after some time there was quiet and we thought they had gone.  And thereafter we heard Mr Blose screaming and saying they should come and help us because we might probably be dead.  I could hear them when they were talking.  And the neighbours gathered.  Thereafter I decided to take my daughter, Dudu, and when I went into the dining-room I saw that by now it was dawn,  /and there",

You have given us a very, very vivid, clear picture of what life was like for you in Inanda in the 1980s.  It is ridiculous that people should have to have lived like that, sleeping in the bush at night, fearing the knock on the door at night.  Not from the police or from the army, but from your own neighbours, and it's evidence of very, very deep political intolerance.\nFrom what you have told us you were very, very lucky not to have been killed that night.  I am sure it was the intention of that person to kill you, and you could so easily have died.  You've heard evidence from many other people today who were killed late at night by people attacking their houses, and you are one of the lucky few.  The fact that you didn't die doesn't mean that you haven't suffered substantial trauma, and we've see what affect it's had on you, and of course on your daughters.   We've heard so many stories like that, of women being attacked at night by armed men.  And whenever this sort of violence  /affects one\naffects one it's terrible and it's unacceptable, but there\njust seems to be something so much worse about somebody in a vulnerable position at night, in their nightdress, being attacked by men with guns.  It really is difficult for us to believe that these things happen so often.\nYou have told us - you have told Dr Mgojo what you would like the Commission to try and do for you, and as he has said we don't have the power to do that directly, to facilitate that, but we will make recommendations to the Government as to how we think you should be assisted.  So we want to thank you all very much for coming in, and we are glad that you were able to be here together to support each other.  Thank you very much.",
