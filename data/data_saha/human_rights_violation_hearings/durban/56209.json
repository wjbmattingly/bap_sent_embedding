I was staying in the rural areas with my grandparents, who later died.  I had just finished my first year, and I grew up in an orphanage.  I went to school at the orphanage, and later on I came back to stay in Chesterville.  That is where I had got my uncle, because my father had been deceased at that time, and my mother had also been deceased.  That is where we got involved with my husband, who at that time was active, and also very close to Chief Luthuli from Groutville.  They were freedom fighters both of them.  They were very active in fighting for human rights.  At the time my uncle was not literate.  He always used to encourage me to read newspapers, and he encouraged me to read for him and translate or interpret, and he would later on tell me what was meant in those newspapers.  He made me somehow politically aware by reading newspapers.

It started when this person died in 1981, and after the death there was a lot of clashes, fights, as well as a lot of confusion in the residential area, because the person who was killed was killed by certain people who were not known.  Then in 1985 there was another fight that broke out.  I don't know how this fight started, but at the end of the day there was a certain bottle store, as well as a bar, which was burnt down and converted into a police station.  And police were staying there, and when the police started there it's then that people started dying.  The first one who died was a certain man from the Mthembu family, who was killed and was run down by a police van.  And at that time the person who was in charge was Commander Visagie.  After this little boy had been run over by the van we started asking ourselves as to what was happening in the community.  Within a week thereafter Phumu from Road Seven, KwaZamisa died.  Within a short while thereafter at Road One a Madonsela boy also died.  And now this became a usual occurrence that young men died in that area.  All of them were quite young.",

Whenever there was a problem in a certain community this A-Team would be fetched to come and rescue the community and then disappear.  Now they were given this name by the community because they were colluding with the police at that time.  These killings went on.  The young men were being killed day in and day out.  At times others would receive telephone calls in the afternoon, or in the evening, and they would be threatened with death.  Immediately thereafter they would be killed.  I also received a similar telephone call at round about half past 11.  I was sitting in the living-room and reading a certain book.  Whoever was on the line said to me, \"We are coming and we are going to kill Mduduzi because he does not want to join our group.\"  Now I didn't know who was talking to me because he never wanted to introduce himself to me, but what I noticed was that his voice was that of a very young person.  I told him that, \"My son, what has happened between you and Mduduzi?  Is there any altercation that took place?\"  He refuted that and he told me that as there two groups in Chesterville my son did not want to join our group, and he was probably joining the other group, and that is the reason why they wanted to kill him at that time.  I told the person over the line that so many young people had died, and they died after receiving telephone calls, and I told him that, \"Whenever you come to kill Mduduzi he must be the very last one to die.  You must not continue this reign of terror.\"  He sounded a bit calm and convinced, and I sort of gave him as an advice as an old person, and I found myself to be wiser than him.  I told him that this group which was conducting a reign of terror was ripping the community of its right of living.  I told him not to involve himself in such killings.  Luckily, up until today these people have never come to kill Mduduzi.  He was at home at that time.  I never woke him up to tell him that I had received such a call. ",

            "  Yes, just at the midst of that confusion on a particular morning I was preparing myself to go to work and I saw a group of women, and I asked myself as to what was happening.  They came to my place and I told myself that I would wait for this group of women, speak to them, and hear as to what their problem was.  They came to me crying, and their plight was also my plight, because they were also worried about the youths who were dying daily.  They said to me they had come so that we could devise a plan to save our children.  \"We are being harassed at our homes.  We do not know who to turn to.\"  I felt powerless.  I did not have any ready-made plans, but I decided that I should pray to the Lord Almighty to give me strength and wisdom to be able to decide as to what we should do with the women.  We prayed, and I asked them to excuse me because I was going to work, and that I would come back to them.  When I came back home on that day I had got a plan.  Then I took my robe and I put a pillow inside my tummy and I pretended to be a pregnant woman.  I went around asking women that we should form a formal prayer group so that we pray to save our children.  They responded positively, and it was on the 15th of May we went around praying with the women together with the children.  We stood in the street underneath the street light and we prayed.  We prayed until dawn.  At about 1.00 am we stopped praying.  Somehow we had this fear, and we kept on asking ourselves as to who was next, who was going to be killed next amongst the youth?  As we were still praying we felt as if the earth was shaking.  When we looked up we noticed that there were cars, a lot of private cars, police cars, as well as police vans and Casspirs, which were heading to the police station, which was a little bit further up.  And we asked ourselves as women what was happening.  We thought maybe somebody had called the police because we had gathered, and probably they thought we were doing something out of line, but we were just praying on that particular day.  We went on praying.  As we were still praying under the street lights there came to Casspirs, being followed by one police van, and this police van came straight to us.  We were not even able to run.  We were arrested, and the soldiers also came and they cocked their guns.  They formed a circle around us.  We stopped praying and there was some quiet.  Nobody was speaking to anyone.  The police did not talk to us.  We also did not talk to them.  There is a certain policeman who was wearing a police uniform, and the others were wearing brown uniforms.  It was cold that day.  I took out my coat and I threw it right in front of the policeman, as well as my scarf and my hat.  I took out everything and I was left only in my dress, and I lifted my hands and I asked as to who the leader of the soldiers was.  The other one who was wearing the police uniform came forward and said he is the one.  I asked him what his name was.  He told me that his name was Bernard.  I asked him whether he was the leader.  He confirmed that.  I told him that as I have lifted my hands I am a woman, and we are all women.  We are not armed.  As I am indicating I do not have not even a fork.  I do not have any arms, so we want to talk with the police without them pointing their guns at us.  We want them to put their guns away so that we can talk freely.  We started talking with Bernard, and Bernard asked us as to what we were doing that time of the night.  I told him that we had come to pray, to pray to the Lord to save us as well as our sons and daughters, because there was a certain group called the A-Team which was notorious for conducting a reign of terror in that residential area.  So we were praying to the Lord to answer our prayers so that this particular group can put down the arms and stop killing the people.  He asked us as to whether we knew the members of this group.  They said they knew the members of the group, and they said we should choose three women who would come to the police station and make a formal statement and say who these people are.  I totally refused because I did not want anyone to be singled out to go and make a statement at the police station.  We wanted to do this collectively as a group.  We marched away as the women, following the very same police van, and we got to the police station.  And the very same gentleman who was speaking to us was no longer there, and at that point we were introduced to another person totally different from the one we spoke to.  We got into the police station and another policeman, a very young one, came to us, and I told him that I wanted to see Bernard.  He went away, but Bernard never came back to speak to us.  There was a very long chalk board.  It was long, but not wide.  It had a list of names, as well as their ranks and works.  That is the people who belonged to the A-Team.  And one of the women said, \"We must not tell them anything because the names of the people were on the blackboard.\"  And at that time one policeman jumped over the counter to conceal the board.",

We continued with these prayer meetings, and at that time I think I was singled out because I was the leader of the woman.  One time when I came back from work I heard some gunshots, and I discovered the following morning that my dogs had been shot.  I went to call the SPCA, and they told the SPCA that they had killed my dogs because my dogs disturbed them during their work at night.  I think it was on the 4th of June when I was from work I went to a certain house and we conducted a prayer meeting.  That was at Khuzwayo's place.  Just before we finished praying the lights went off and children were arrested outside.  We left the prayer meeting and went out to investigate.  We discovered that the soldiers had arrested our children.  Each and every one of them had a youth in his hand.  I asked them as to what the youths had done.  They left the youths alone.  The youths ran away, and at that time it was dark.  The lights had gone off.  We decided to wake other neighbours and tell them that, \"Here is an attack that has",

They said I looked like the one I wanted.  Then I said, \"I am happy.  If you people could be looking for me I could be happy.\"  But there is one who had a great suspicion that I was the one they were looking for, and he ultimately went out, and at that time i did not go back home.  My sisters and I went away.  I knew that the police were searching for me, and we were on the wrong path.  So we started to be on the run.  We went away from our homes.  My son at that time also ran away from home, and we were not seen thereafter.  We only came back in 1988.   We were not hiding in Umlazi.  I only went back to Umlazi in 1987 when I had got a house.  When I got there I told myself that all was behind me, the past belonged to the past, but on the 7th in 1990, during the night, I heard some knocks all over the windows.  People were saying that they were police and that I should open up the doors.  I heard that the voices that were speaking outside were white people's voices, and the knocks were noticeably violent, and I told my children to sleep so that whoever came at that time should kill us whilst we were sleeping.  I told my children that we shall die inside the house defenceless, even if they may tell lies later on, but the truth will come out at the end of the day.  They started throwing tear-gas canisters inside the house through the windows, and they even sprayed through the open windows, especially the bathroom window.  And at that time we started suffocating, but luckily it never really affected us.  Apparently it affected them.  Just when I was trying to grab a towel - I wanted to protect myself, as well as my children - but it did not affect us at the end of the day.  There was a two-year-old child at the time, but nothing happened to the child.  They started once more threatening us that they were going to throw tear-gas canisters again.  They threw in more tear-gas canisters.  I said whoever was scared amongst my children must come to me.  They came to me and I protected them.  I started praying because I lived by prayer.

They said it for the third time.  They kept on repeating it until they climbed on top of the roof, and at that time I get very scared because the windows were broken, the doors were broken, and they were climbing on top of the roof.  Everybody was scared at that time.  I went out.  I was in my nightdress.  I went out so as for them to see that I did not have any arms.  When I went out into the kitchen I heard somebody screaming that I should come out very quickly.  I went out.  I saw white men, as well as two black men.  Just as I went out they all stood up.  There were so many of them.  They were surrounding my house.  Some were behind the house, some were at the neighbours' places.  They started pointing their torches at me, and they loaded their guns and they pointed their guns at me.  I asked them as to what was left of me, because they had already broken into my house.  I looked at them and I told them that they should fire, they should shoot me.  I faced them in all these directions telling them that they should kill me, because I felt very annoyed at that time.  But they never shot me.  I saw two white people coming, and they tried to strangle me.  They dragged me into the house.  Just before we got into the house they said I should take everybody - or direct everybody to get out of the house.  There was a two-year-old boy, my cousin's child, my sister's daughter, who had come to visit, as well as my adopted daughter.  Nhlanhla was also there.  He was in standard six and he was staying at my place.  They pushed me inside the house, and I went on switching the lights on because it was dark when we got into the house.  They looked around, searched the house, but they never got anything.  And another group came in, a very big group.  I started screaming, and people started coming out, and the soldiers started running.  They held me and they said to me I think that they are thieves, wasn't I aware that they were police?  I told them that they were killers, they were housebreakers, they were thieves.  They were harassing people.  I asked them where Stanley was, because he was also a policeman and he ended up being a criminal.  And at that point they did not know what to say to me.  They went inside the house with me.  They went in through the safety hole which was in the ceiling.  They went through that and disappeared.  I don't know where they disappeared to.  And at that time I saw five elderly men, very old men about my age.  They came, and they were boasting, and they came into my yard.  Because I was very angry I grabbed one of them and asked them as to what I had done.  This one was very tall, and he looked down upon me and asked me as to whether I didn't know that I was hiding terrorists in my house.  I exclaimed and I started screaming and calling everybody, and I told him that, \"The only terrorists that I know are you.  You are the only terrorists that I know who have been terrorising my family.  I have never terrorised anyone.\"  We went into the house.  They went around searching.  They looked at the walls and they asked me what my name was.  I asked them who were they looking for.  They said I should tell them my name.  I told them my name.  I told them that my name was no secret, but I told them that as they had come into my house they were supposed to introduce themselves to me.",

They had also taken tiles from my roof, and I had to spend a lot of money trying to re-roof my place.  But I did not know who to turn to for this sort of help, and I told them that I was going to report them so that they would come and fix whatever damage that they had done.  And at that time the President had just come out of Robben Island, and they told me that I should go to Mandela and Mandela was going to fix my house.  That is when they went out.  This is the sort of harassment that I got, because I kept on being threatened that I was going to be shot and going to be killed.  I always lived in fear.  I ended up losing a great deal of weight due to the fear that they used to instil in my family as well as my children.

You have described to us some of the activities of the A-Team in Chesterville during the 1980s, and your story is very similar to stories which we have heard from people in the Free State, where we heard about similar gangs.  We heard about gangs called the Eagles and the Three Million gang, and all these gangs were set up in the same way and had the same aim, to intimidate, to harass, and to kill politically active members of the community.  And the police cynically used these gangs, these surrogate forces in many parts of the country for several years.  And in Chesterville, as we know, and as you have told us, many people were brutally assaulted, and more than 20 people were killed by the A-Team in Chesterville.  And this evidence is important because it provides us with a background about the A-Team and how it co-operated with the police, and when we write our report at the end of our period of office your evidence will be there to tell us about the history and the activities of the A-Team.  And you've also given us a very vivid description of what life was like for a politically active person in Umlazi in 1990, and this is also important for the purposes of our report.\nSo we thank you very much for coming in, and we wish you well as you go.

            "  It was on a Wednesday, on the 9th.  I was supposed to go court in Ndwedwe, and I was supposed to pass at his school, but I was not able to go to him at school, then I went straight to court.  He was staying with my sister-in-law, and I was staying here in Durban, and each time I would go past his school, then on Fridays he would come back, and he had a temporary job that he did on Saturday as well as Sunday, and then he would come back home and leave on Monday for school.  So that was routine, that's what he used to do.  He used to come back on Friday.  I went to Ndwedwe on that particular day, and I came back home without going to him at school.  And then on Thursday I went back to work, and when I came back from work I was told that two males had come from Ndwedwe.  They were the Mthembu males, and they gave them cool drink as well as biscuits.  I went to pay them money because they had taken these things on credit.  On Friday I said they must go fetch his reference book.  They went to fetch his reference book at Ntuzuma.  When I came back on Friday I said they should show me his ID even before he came back, and each time I come back on Friday I  would get him at home.  Just as I opened his reference book I heard a voice that said, \"The owner of this reference book is no longer alive.\"",

            "(Inaudible) ... that you are too upset.  Just take a few minutes to recover.  We know it must be very difficult for you now.  (Pause)   Then I told my other children to close the ID and put it away, and I asked them whether he had come.  They said no, he had not yet come.  And it was quite a surprise because it was the first time that he hadn't come home, because it was late already.  And I kept on talking to myself, wondering as to what had happened.  I slept, and we woke up the following morning and I went to my relative's place where my father's sister had died, and I asked my sister-in-law as to where my son was.  She told me that he had gone on Wednesday, and she thought that I had taken my child.  Then I said to my sister-in-law probably my child was dead, because if he went away on a Wednesday, and by Saturday he was not yet at home, there could be something wrong that had taken place.  I came back to Durban and I told my neighbours as to what had happened.  Then on Sunday my neighbours accompanied me.  We went around looking.  I didn't even know where to go.  My sister-in-law at that time had earlier told me at the funeral that my son had received a letter from certain males who were staying at Amawoti, and these youths were comrades, and he had been called by these youths.  We went around looking for him at hospitals as well as mortuaries.  We went around explaining, but we did not seem to be accepted.  I think the corpse was there, but the way we described him probably led to some confusion or misunderstanding.  We went back without finding him on that particular day.  Then on Monday my husband's relatives came.  They said they wanted to help me look for my son.  We went to school where he was schooling.  We were told that he had gone to Amawoti together with that group of people who were comrades, because there were a lot of comrades at that time, as well as Inkatha members, who went around burning people's houses.  We went around looking for him.  We even stayed at Ndwedwe without getting any help.  We went back home on that particular day, and we were doing this up and down looking for him.  Then on Tuesday we went to Verulam and we tried to get some clue as to where he could possibly be, because we were told that he had gone to Amawoti, but nobody was prepared to volunteer any information to us.  We searched for him until the afternoon on that particular day, until we reached a resolution that we should go ask some soldiers to help us look for him.  Then on a Wednesday morning we went to the soldiers.  They accompanied us.  We went to Amawoti together with my other daughter.  My daughter went with the soldiers.  I was left at that place called Entabeni.  At about 1 o'clock during the day they got a telephone call - the police station got a telephone call from Amawoti that they should come and collect a corpse.  The policemen from Entabeni told us that they had received information that there was a corpse at Amawoti, and we should go and identify the corpse.  We followed the police car together with my brother's child.  When we got to the police station we saw the corpse, but it was not my son's corpse.  We reported this matter to the police station that we were also looking for a corpse, and we described my son, and that we had suspicions that he had died in Amawoti.  The policeman I was speaking to said there is a corpse that was discovered on a Thursday morning, but they were not the ones who took the corpse.  The corpse was taken by the Phoenix police, so we should go to Phoenix to investigate.  We went to Phoenix, and we were given the number of the corpse, and we went back to Verulam with the number.  And when we got to Verulam we identified him, but it was difficult for me to identify him because he was swollen all over the body.  I was relieved to see the corpse because I wanted to buy my son.  I wanted to give back to God whatever he had given to me.  I was relieved, and I waited for the funeral and I ultimately buried him.  After the burial I was never quite the same because my son was the apple of my eye, and he was the most understanding child amongst my other children.  He was quite different from them.  Then I started getting heart problems.  My heart started getting sore, and I now recalled that there were certain youths who came who were bought cold drink, and I thought probably the two youths who had come had killed my son, because I don't know what they wanted in my house.  Even today I still tell myself that they were not the only ones.  Probably it was a group, and the two were sent to come and look for my son.  And what pains me even more is the fact that my children tried to entertain them by buying them cool drink and biscuits, only to find they were the ones who were looking for my son.  And whenever I saw schoolchildren, especially wearing their uniform, I couldn't bear to look at them, because when my son died at that age he was still at school.  And each time I went past a certain place called Bester I usually saw my son crossing the street, proceeding to school.  Even though he was not there, but he was in my imagination.  Even after I had counted years, and told myself that by now he should have probably finished his matric, he could be working and he could be helping me, and I keep on counting years and imagining the things that he would be doing for me if he was alive.  Because he was my only hope.  He was very constructive as a child.  He showed some signs that he cared so much for me as a parent, because even when he was holding this temporary job he used the money to help with the household expenses.  He would give me the money and I would give him some pocket money, and we would use the other money for the other children.  So I knew deep down inside my heard that at the end of the day he would be the one amongst the other children who would help me.  And I took him as the breadwinner who would take care of his sisters as well as other brothers.  Now this troubles me so much",

My question comes back to this period we're talking about, and you were intimately involved at that time.  We are told that between 1980 and 1993 that 35 000 people died in our country.  We are also told that 1978 to 1990 was a period of reform in our country, and we also know that part of that period of reform, and extension which went before already, was the homeland structure that was in existence already.  I would value your opinion actually as to what you felt, why you actually in a sense rejected on the one side this period of reform that people talk about, and at the same time rejected, it seems, the homeland structure that we know existed in this part of the country.  Although not accepted as an independent state, but nonetheless there was a Legislature, people were allowed to vote for that Legislature in other parts of the country, people recognised these independent structures.

You were a political activist for many years in Chesterville, and because of this, and because of your son Thabani's activities, you were continually harassed by the police.  You were frequently detained for questioning, your house was set alight, and tragically in the end your son died.  The policeman who instigated much of this reign of terror against you was a very powerful person, and for many years held a senior position in the Security Branch in Durban.  His name, as you have told us and as we know, is Andy Taylor, and he is presently facing charges of murder for the death of Griffiths Mxenge.  This is the calibre of policemen that the regime used to intimidate and harass courageous people like yourself.  You have provided us with a valuable commentary on those years in Chesterville, and we are grateful for that.  And as Dr Randira says, that your commentary will find its way into our reports, and it would be so much more valuable if many of the other people who came and gave statements to the Truth Commission could give the sort of background that you have provided to us, rather than just telling us about the specific incident that they were involved in.\nSo we thank you again very much for coming forward, and we certainly are investigating the A-Team in Chesterville, as you have requested us to do so.  We have already started investigations into the A-Team, and we hope that at the end of the day we can come up with some coherent answers as to why this organisation existed and who was responsible for its existence.

I went to Umlazi, and I was there for a few months, and I went to Izingolweni.  That's where I built  my house.  You know I don't think my family is safe enough there because people are scared of associating with us, and to be seen as people who are close to us.  I took Mbusi to some other place in Impendle, and also rented a house for - I came back to Durban, and I was looking for -he said he was staying at KwaMakutha in Mr Nxwensa's house, and I asked him as to how safe the place was.  He said the place was not safe, but he was also scared to go to school because the schools could not accept him because of his past.  I was at my wits end, and I left him there to attend school.  Then in 1988, as well as in 1989, he was staying there.  Then in 1989 he sent a message that I should come to him because he wanted to see me.  I went there to see him, and I also sent a message that I had arrived.  He told me that it is now 1989 and he had passed his matric, and he promised me that he was going to build me a house, because all this that took place was because of him.  He admitted that he knew about political organisations, and he was sorry that I did not know anything, but I ended up being a victim.  He further told me that he had had an altercation with Mrs Mtshali, and I asked him as to what problem there was.  He told me to listen carefully.  He related to me that he got involved with Mrs Mtshali's daughter in 1985.  This shocked me because I had not seen anything amiss.  After the family had separated I went away.  Then when I came back I discovered that the lady I was involved with had now been involved with another person.  I told him that that was his own problem.  And he further told me that this woman was involved with a KwaZulu policeman, and he did not want the relationship to end between him and his girlfriend.  And I realised that his life was not safe now after he was the policeman's rival, and I left him at that place.  I think it was in October or November during the year 1989 when I left.  I went away.  Then towards December I went back and I tried to look for my son.  We had a conversation and he told me that he had had an altercation with the policeman.  They were walking with the girlfriend, and at that time they came across the policeman, who said they suited each other.  And he abused him verbally, and he ran towards a certain Mr Mtshali's place.  Victor went to where he was staying.  That was at No 23.  Then immediately thereafter he said the girlfriend came back to tell him that he was going to be evicted at that place if he continued with the relationship.  Then Victor had to give the relationship up so that he could have a place to stay.  And at that particular time he was not working.  It was towards festive season, and in January, immediately after the new year, it was on a Sunday, I woke up and went to our church service.  I  received a telephone call that Victor had been",

Then on a Monday morning I received another telephone call, and it was Mrs Msani from Lamontville, who said - I did not speak personally over the phone, but the message that I got was that I should go to Mrs Msani before I proceeded to KwaMakutha.  And I did exactly that, I went to Mrs Msani.  When I got to Mrs Msani she told me that she had also received a call that she should tell me.  I also told her that I received the same phone call from an unidentified or anonymous caller.  They decided that they were going to take me to the scene, but just before we went Mrs Mtshali phoned, an Mrs Mtshali said I am sitting there and she is waiting for me at her place.  I told her that whoever was calling did not say who he or she was, and I could not have known that it was Mrs Mtshali.  And I further told her that the area in which she was was very dangerous, and I could not come all by myself, and she put down the phone on me.  And Mrs Msani took me with at Nxwensa.

When they came to my bed my bed was burning, and they neglected to lift it.  This other one tried to handle the frame, but the frame of the bed was hot because it was in flames.  But I could see their feet as they were walking past, and I could see they were wearing police boots.  They attacked and they left.  I was left inside the house.  When the house was now in smoke I managed to get out and escape.  They went away, and I also got a chance to escape from the house.  I went to sleep at a certain place.  Then the following day we went to the playgrounds.  When I got there I - I think Thulani was 11 years old, and he had been shot.  He was wearing a white T-shirt.  Thulani had been shot on the chest, as well as in the heart.  There was a big hole.  It looked as if they had actually tried to rip the bullet out of the flesh.  His fingers were missing.  His private parts were missing.  They had cut them out and they had placed a liquor, a home-brewed beer box on his private parts, and there was a big hold on the chest.  His tongue was also missing.  I went to make a statement because I was the one who was there.  I went to the police to submit a statement as to what had happened.  Before I went to submit the statement I saw Mr Mkhize, and I saw some tyres in front of Mr Mkhize's car.  I saw him taking some red meat from the tyres, and I was surprised as to what that red meat was doing.  It was in a certain plastic, and he noticed that I had seen him.  He looked at me with some surprise.  I asked myself as to what the meat was doing in a green plastic and between the tyres.  When I got to the police I submitted the statement.  When I came back from the police Mkhize chased me.  He tried to shoot me, but he missed.  I was having a steriliser in my hand, and he shot part of the bottle and I was left handling the neck of the bottle.  But I didn't notice that he had shot the bottle.  I only realised later on that I was left with the neck of the bottle thereafter.  And after that there was this serious harassment, as well as disturbances between Mr Mkhize and myself.  That's when they ended up attacking us.  I could not stay at home at that juncture because Mkhize, as well as Inkatha members, were harassing us.  What causes me to say it was Inkatha that was at my place to attack, they were singing their war cry.  They have some war cries that they utter, and they were uttering their war cries.  They have particular war cries that they utter whenever they attack.  And I had seen one of Inkatha members having something that looked like a baton, and the Inkatha members shot us - shot at us and they ran to Nyosini.  And the ZP Police used to go to that place at Nyosini.  That's where they used to meet apparently.  And thereafter I could not go to school.  I ultimately had to go away from the school, and whenever they looked at my document that said I was Ntuli family, and I was coming from KwaMakutha, I would not get a school, I would not be accepted because of my past and the place at which I was staying.  I went away in 1989, and that's where I schooled.  That's all I can say.",

            "Mrs Ntuli and Mbusi, we thank you both very much for coming here today and telling your respective stories.  As Mr Lax has said, only two kilometres from here, in the Supreme Court, a large number of people - I think there are 22 of them, including the former Minister of Defence, Magnus Malan, the Chief of the Army, and many other generals and senior officers, are on trial for the murder of your husband and daughters, and your father and sisters.  We don't know if these people will be found guilty of the murders, and if they are found guilty we will subpoena them to come to this Commission to tell you, and to tell the members of the public, why they did what they did.  It is also possible that even if they are not found guilty we will subpoena some of those people in order to shed light on the terrible massacre which took place.  As you know the evidence against these people is that Chief Minister Buthelezi, as he then was, requested the Defence Force to provide him with a covert or secret offensive unit which could be deployed against the UDF, and the evidence contained in the docket is that the South African Defence Force acted on this request, and that they recruited a number of IFP members in the townships around Durban, and they sent them to an army camp in the Caprivi Strip to be trained in the use of weapons.  And the evidence is that these people were then sent back to Durban, and they were housed in army barracks of the Defence Force.  And the docket goes on to state that these people became impatient, and they wanted to practice their newly acquired skills, and that, with the help of the Secretary of Inkatha, Mr M Z Khumalo, a target was chosen, and the target was a certain Mr Thusini, who was a tenant in your house.  And the evidence goes on to state that a Defence Force vehicle with false numberplates dropped off a number of armed men near your house in KwaMakutha in the middle of the night, and that they attacked and killed your family.",

Briefly at Clermont were families who lived in peace, peacefully, but after some time we went through difficult times now, harassment and so forth, although I wouldn't even know where this started.  When I bring this picture forward, Clermont is a place where people have bought themselves sites.  It's not like a location, where people will pay rent and already occupy houses that were existing.  People were buying sites and built for themselves.  And I also grew up and I bought myself a site.  Through it all, as people who know where we come from, we were people who will appreciate to live in peace if anything.  No violence or no harassment should go on.  But when time went on things started to happen now as a result of Clermont being under the Zulu Government, KwaZulu Government.  Many people did not like this, but since people are so different, and have different interests, but most of us, the majority did not like the idea, because we knew that if we were under the discrimination, racist government, we will not exercise our rights.  To this day what brought me here is one of the things that led to our harassment.  One time there was a Commission that came into place that disclosed the truth, asking why didn't we want to go to KwaZulu Government.  Many things were listed, and I am one of those who were present at the Commission in Durban at Four Seasons.  My cousin accompanied me, who already is late now.  After a while we arrived there.  Some girls came.  I know one of those girls, although I don't quite remember her because this happened some time ago.  I asked her, \"Are you also here?

            "  It was a funeral of Mrs Shabalala.  We were at a meeting just before the funeral.  We were at a meeting of the Clermont community at night.  Just when the meeting was going on Shabalala's boy came and said, \"Rush, Dad, my mum has been shot already.\"  We left the meeting immediately.  We rushed to the scene and we found her.  Truly she was shot, and she was lying there in the river of blood.  It looked like they had slaughtered three sheep, but she was already taken to the hospital.  We went to Mariannhill and we got there.  We found out that she was not inside, but still in the van outside.  The doctor saw that she had already died.  But what was the most painful thing to see is the way she died.  She died brutally.  I was one of the speakers at her funeral, representing the businessmen of Clermont.  My speech was not so long, it was brief, because there wasn't much to say.  But what I think brought enmity for me are the things that I said.  I remember one time when we heard ... (inaudible) ... on an Indian in Durban who had already finished people.  Many people will remember this.  I think one day - what I am telling you is that one day he was arrested.  I remembered Mavini, who finished the whole world killing people, but he was finally arrested.  And I said this person who committed this crime - because we knew, we suspected someone, and there was one we suspected so strongly that he had committed this crime, and I said, \"God will disclose the person who has done this.  We will get to know about the person who did this.\"  And when I got outside after my speech I met Mr Makhatini outside, who was Jamile's friend.  And I said, \"Mr Makhatini\" - he is my cousin by the way, I said, \"You go and tell your friend, because you know each other and you know very well that he did this, but finally he will get arrested.  He must know that.\"  And after that my cousin dismissed all what I said and went on.  Then after a few days, because the funeral day was Tuesday - Wednesday, Thursday, Friday - Saturday morning, it was just during the day Saturday, I visited one of my friends, who was a businessman in Pinetown.  We were just chatting.  I told him the danger of what transpired, and also I went on to say that, \"I am sure those people will get so agitated and so annoyed and so angry from what I have said in my speech.  I know they will be after me.\"  Now, one time we were sleeping at night, as I have already said that all my children have left home because they are older.  We were there with the helper, with my wife and myself and the helper at night.  I heard my wife waking me up, saying, \"Obed, wake up.  There are people talking outside, making noise.\"  When I tried to open my eyes I stood up.  It was around half past 12 on the 21st of February 1988.  When I woke up, went to the passage in the house, I just saw this rainbow.  It was green-red in the house already, and I got back.  I said, \"Wake up, wake up, we are being bombed here.\"  My wife woke up and I approached the door, the kitchen door.  When I was opening the door I saw people standing out there in their uniforms, police uniforms, and their caps.  One other was so fat and the other was so tiny.  When I tried to do this he shot me just once, and it just got into my thigh.  It grazed my thigh.  They were shaking, and you could tell that the things that they were doing were evil.  And he shot me once again, and that hit me.  That one was scaring.  I could see smoke, and I got shot.  And I tried to hold onto the door, and I could feel that I have some kind of fracture on my foot.  And I said to my wife, \"Let's call the police quickly.\"  I tried to hold onto my wife, walk slowly towards the phone, and I picked up the receiver.  As I was trying to dial I saw my wife dropping something, and I saw her running out.  When she was trying to run out there those people came.  This other one looked at me.  My wife managed to escape, to run away from the situation.  Right at that time when that guy was trying to hit me, beat me, I held him tight.  When I was trying to even hold even stronger, trying to get his cap off so I could see him who he was, he refused and he shot me again.  And I said to myself, \"He got me this time.\"  I said, \"Yes, he got me.\"  The house was in flames.  You see, before I came home, before I went back inside - maybe let me say this.  Before all this transpired we used to rehearse and say, \"When people come to shoot us what will we do?\"  We had a basement.  Now, my friend's child fell there on that basement, and that's just how my wife fell, just like that child, to the basement.  Well, as I was there shattered, in pain still, it was dark at home, but you could see one another because of the flames, fire.  They ran away, the fled.  When I heard from people they were 19.  19 people were outside and two inside.  In all they were 21.  I just heard that from people.  I just heard that figure from people.  The house was burning, the curtains in fire, the headboards in flames, smoky all over.  I said to myself, \"You know, I once said when I die I should be cremated, but I never thought I will die alive like this in this way.\"  But suddenly I recalled and my memory got back, and I went to the dressing table and I tried to open the window, and the air got in now and I could breathe properly after that.  You see I could feel that I have lost my arm and my foot as well.  I cannot even walk or do anything.  I tried to walk and I did.  When I was trying to shake I could feel the bone.  I held onto the bone so strongly and struggled with my other left foot to walk.  And in the passage it was wet because my wife was trying to extinguish the fire using water.  I crawled, crawled up to the kitchen, and there was a steps towards the basement from the kitchen side.  When I got to the steps I said, \"Now I am outside even when the house is burning and in flames, but I am outside and safe.\"  But after some time the geyser exploded, and hot water was all over, splashing all over, and I was burned from the geyser water.  And I wasn't dressed, properly dressed, I just had a pyjama top, because I had already taken out my trouser, my pyjama bottom, because it was soaked in blood.  I tried to go out.  There was a tap down there, and I am burning, and the house also is falling apart now.  The ceiling was beginning to fall.  I was burning on the other side.  Now I said to myself, \"No, let me just get down.\"  And also I said, \"How will I get down to the steps.  Maybe I should devise a plan to get down the steps,\" and I held onto my thighs so tight and I went down slowly.  When I got down there there was a pipe, but fortunately I did not disconnect the hose pipe from the tap, so the hose pipe was connected to the tap.  I moved slowly towards the hose pipe to get hold of it so I could open the tap, and I sprinkled my body all over with water.  That's how I survived that fire, the burning.  And one gentleman came and said, \"What's happening?\"  I said, \"Don't ask me questions, just try to get me out of this place.\"  He looked at me, and I think he just said to himself, \"Things are bad here.\"  And I tried to move, but I could not, but the neighbours came suddenly.  My neighbours were standing watching this, so that when I was outside they quickly rushed to me.  I don't know when they came, but they were there suddenly.  The car almost caught fire, but it did not get burnt.  And the neighbours tried to help us and see how they could get us save from the situation, and they took me.  Now, when I were outside now by the street, and waiting for the ambulance, I remembered where's my wife.  I did not know where my wife is, and I went back to the house and there was no way to see where my wife was at the time.  The house was in flames, burning.  Suddenly a boy came and said - told me that my wife was out there.  She survived.  She was shot four times.  The other one grazed on the head, the other here.  Her ear is not functioning properly.  The other one the shoulder, the other one on the thigh.  Fortunately, by God's grace, I don't know how she survived this.  And after that they took us into the ambulance, we were taken to the hospital.  Most fortunately when we got to the hospital I called one doctor who was a friend of mine, and they told me he was not on duty, but he was called.  He came.  I won't mention his name because I know they'll be after him.  He contacted other doctors and they helped us, they attended us.  My wife could not even talk.  You see I talk a lot.  I have a verbal diarrhoea.  I talk a lot.  Well, the weekend passed.  On Friday - because they left me before they could do anything to my leg, to my thigh and to my foot until a certain time.  They said they will just hold on before they could do anything further or complicated on my thigh.  But they put a pin in my thigh, and it's still there even now.  During the day around 12 - I was not eating yet.  They used to bring me food at the hospital.  I will take food and try to eat, and I could not eat it.  You know, I could not even get the taste.  I will try an apple, I will try a banana, especially that I like bananas, and I will manage to eat banana and take the second banana, but I don't remember if I finished the second banana.  But at around one I felt powerless.  Because I was right next - my ward was right next to the duty room I went to the window to knock at the window, and when the nurse came she asked me, \"What's happening, Mr Mthembu?  What's wrong?  Oh, please call the doctor.  I think he is dying.\"  I touched my tongue.  I could not feel.  I felt numb.  And the doctor marched in suddenly and asked what was happening.  You know, what completely finished me, the doctors were working 24 hours.  They did help me a lot.  After that I was discharged.",

And after looking for those youths he must bring them with to them, and they must go to a certain shack.

My son went away to look for other youths to no avail.  They were told to get into a certain house at No 16.  They went there.  I think they were about five.  They went into this shack, and when they got to the shack which was pointed out by the police they were shown guns.  That is according to what was related to me, because I was not there.  And in the street there was a certain kombi with dark windows, and it was also dark, it was in the evening.  Most of the lights in the houses were off because it was late at night.  The only people who were not asleep were the ones who were staying in the shack that my son went to.  There were certain vans waiting at a certain bridge next to a certain village called Masixanga, and the police as well as the SB were waiting there, as well as at the cemetery, and vans were lining the street.  The youths went into this shack, and some other police who belonged to the SB, as well as one female - there were two females.  They went into this particular shack and they were shown guns.  They were asked as to whether they knew what these were, and the children said they didn't know anything about guns.  And they were asked whether they wanted to skip the country.  The youths said they wanted to skip the country, and the policemen said to them they should wait there.  As they were still waiting there for the policemen to come back they shot them through the windows of the shack, and everybody else inside was shot.  One of the youths escaped through the window.  He was shot in the knee.  The other one was stampeded upon, and my son was just in pieces.  And people were running away because they did not know what was happening, and they did not know where the SBs were.

The incident that you have described to us is a famous one in the history of Chesterville, and many of us here know about it.  It was a classic set-up or a trap which was laid by the police for those young boys, and as far as we know, the information that we have is that the whole episode, the whole incident was arranged - organised by members of the Vlakplaas unit in the Transvaal together with members of the Security Branch here in Durban.  These boys were murdered in a situation where it was impossible for them to have even defended themselves in any manner.  And, as your son says, the inquest Magistrate - I recall from the time - he allowed the witnesses to give evidence completely in camera, with their faces covered, and this should never ever have been allowed.\nWe are glad that the two of you were able to be here today, and that you were able to be supported by your son, and we hope it was of some comfort to you.  We will do everything possible to find out why this happened, and if necessary to call those people who caused this to happen to come before this Commission so that they can explain themselves.

It is tragic for a child to die, and for those children who were not killed, but just exposed to violence, it also has a lasting effect on them.  It changes their attitude towards the communities, and very frequently leads to a perpetuation of the cycle of violence, and those young people very often themselves become perpetrators.\nWe understand what you say that it is better for a parent to know and to have seen where their child is buried than never to know, and we understand some of the suffering that you are going through, and we will try to find out what happened to your son.\nSo again thank you very much for coming and speaking to us today.

            "  I received a telephone call.  That was in the evening.  It was in 1993 on a Monday, Monday evening.  It was at about quarter past eight or half past eight, thereabouts.  I was phoned and told that my son-in-law had been shot.  Two youths got into the house.  They were wearing coats, and they said they were policemen, and they said they wanted to see Thami.  And they were told that Thami was already asleep, and they went around searching for him in the house and they got into the bedroom.  They said to him he must take out the guns, because they had come to get the guns that he was manufacturing.  He directed them to look for the guns themselves, to search if they wanted to, because he did not know anything about the guns.  They told him to take out the guns, and he said they should search for them because they said they were policemen.  They did not even go into the other bedrooms to search, they just shot him on the chest.  And each time he asked them as to what he had done they kept on changing and they kept on shooting him.  When he tried to run away they held him - they held her and they said she should watch her husband being killed, and she was forced to sit down.  She sat down and watched as they shot her husband several times, until such time that he fell, he collapsed.  She was not sure as to how many bullets were pumped into his body.  So I am staying with his children presently.  I was staying them even after the accident, and I asked as to where he was.  They told me that he had been taken to the hospital.  I phoned King Edward Hospital, but I could not get any reply.  My husband told me not to phone because probably he was at the theatre.  Even if we wanted to visit him we would not be able to see him.  We tried several times to phone, but nobody answered the phone.  Then at about 5 o'clock in the morning I tried once more, and I asked as to where my son-in-law was and I told them the name of my son-in-law.  I also introduced myself as well and I told them that I was his mother-in-law.  They told me that he had died at 10 past 10.  They had tried all they could, but they could not save him because he was bleeding profusely due to the wounds, and he died at 10.  But the most disturbing thing is that I am staying with his children and I am maintaining his children.  I don't have the power to maintain the whole family single-handedly, because I have to put them through school as well, and at times when they ask for things as children I cannot be able to give them whatever they ask for, and this makes me feel so bad.  Because I don't know who can help me to raise the children because the money that my husband gets cannot be able to make ends meet for the whole family.  It cannot keep the whole family above water.  I don't know how or where I can get help.  Then I said to my daughter we should go to Thembalihle in KwaMashu.  When we got there they were accepted, they were welcomed, and now I was scared to stay at the sister-in-law's place so we had to come back.  She told them as to where the husband was working.  They required the address of where the husband was working.  They told her to take the children's birth certificates and submit them to their offices, and she duly did that.  When one of them was being stamped at the post office we were told to go to the police station, and we went to the police station to have one birth certificate stamped.  When we went to Thembalihle to submit the statements they did help us, because my daughter is also not working, she lost her job where she was working before.  The officer at Thembalihle Welfare told her to stay for five years and they would phone her and give her a file number.  ",

Also you have the problem of your daughter, and it is quite clear that she has been very badly affected by this incident.  Most of the stories that we have heard, that you have heard today, took place many - not many years ago, but several years ago in the eighties.  This one took place only six or seven months before our first free elections in this country, in late 1993, and it reminds us that we still have to be very vigilant about the terrible political intolerance that affects our province because these things are still continuing in parts of this province.\nAs you know, and as you have heard me say today, we don't have the power to make recommendations - we don't have the power to assist you directly, financially or otherwise, but our job is to make recommendations to the Government, and we will be making recommendations to the Government on your behalf and on behalf of the children that you are raising, because it seems clear that your son-in-law was killed as a result of political intolerance and political violence.  \nSo thank you for coming and speaking on behalf of those small children today, and we hope that your daughter will be able to come and talk to us as well.

And at this time he was very stubborn.  We were taken to Mr Maphalala's office.  I was taken together with Xolani to Mr Maphalala's office, and they would ask him about the ANC and he would answer them because he knew, and I didn't know anything about politics and political groups.  And they would come in and say, \"As soon as you've finished asking him questions you must give him to us.  We shall deal with him accordingly.\"  But Mr Maphalala sort of intervened, because he was an elderly man and therefore he was reasonable, much more reasonable than the youth.  And at that time I could not sleep in the house any more because I had had this experience, so I would sleep under the tree, and Xolani used to sleep on the roof.

At times I would get home and hear rumours that he had been chased and had been assaulted, and they would do all sorts of things to him.

Buy some meat,\" because they were hawkers, but on this particular day when I went past them they did not sell me the meat, and somehow I felt something was wrong.  I felt it in me that nobody was selling me anything today, say probably there is something wrong.  Just as I looked I noticed that I was being escorted somehow.  There was a youth behind me, a youth on my left as well as my right hand, and there was a youth right in front of me.  I suspected that they were surrounding me.  At some stage I decided to stop, and whenever I stopped they also stopped.  We went up to a certain hillock, and as we descended the hillock I saw a group of me who were standing.

As I said to witnesses yesterday, we have heard so many mothers telling us about the death of their children, and, as you must know better than anybody, it is a terrible thing to have to bury a child, especially in your case, where Sipho was an only child.  Yesterday I commented on the role that the Defence Force played under the old government, and that instead of upholding the law and protecting people they spent much of their time and energy, and much of the taxpayers' money, pursuing the political opponents of the previous Government, harassing them, assaulting them, and, in the case of your son, killing them, and we hope that we have passed that era forever.\nAs Mr Lax said, we have heard what your request is.  Our job is to make recommendations to the State President and to the Government as to how victims of the violence, people like yourself, should be assisted, and we will be taking those recommendations to the Government.
