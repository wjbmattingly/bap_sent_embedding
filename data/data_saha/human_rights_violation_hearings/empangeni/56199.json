Those who have come to give testimony with regard to human rights violations that they went through in the past as well as things that happened to their relatives and families and the community at large.  We admire the courage with which you have handled this matter so that you may appear before this Commission in order to try and straighten up the wrongs that were done in the past.  We thank you very much for the effort.  We wish that the Lord may help you and give you strength and courage to give testimony without fear and without hindrance and without any doubt.  We also thank those who have come before this Commission even those who have accompanied the witnesses and their community to come and witness the changing of history as a new era dawns.  We urge you to encourage the others who were also violated in the past to come and appear before this Commission so that they can also have a chance to relate their stories.  But I want especially to welcome these young South Africans who have come to be here this morning with us.  They will say in future when they tell their children and their friends in the future generation when you'll be reading history - when this thing becomes history to say that, \"You know when there were the hearings at Empangeni, we were there.  We listened.  We heard.\"  We feel that you are already involving yourselves in the process of reconciliation and cleansing of our nation because when you are here you are part of it.  We thank  the one who is with you, who has accompanied to come with you.  May the Lord bless you always so that you can hear this, so that we don't - because after all this country's yours in future, you young people, so that during the times when you're old, these things which have happened will never happen again.  We are one nation, the rainbow nation.  Thank you very much.",

Jesus prophesied.  He looked at the woman and he looked at the children and when he saw a certain woman he said the woman should not cry for him but they should cry for themselves as well as their children.  When we look at the history of torture and violence or violation of human rights, we always come across women who have suffered and children who have also suffered.

They assaulted and they harassed people and it's not surprising that you have the attitude towards the police that you have today.  We hope that we are moving to an era where that sort of thing is past us although we know that in many parts of KwaZulu/Natal that is not the case.  Many of those people, as Dr Mgojo has said, are still in senior positions in the police.  You have given us a couple of names of these policemen and we know those police stations.  We know the KwaMbonambi Police Station, the Sundumbili Police Station, the riot unit at Mtubatuba.

They looked for money.  They looked for a gun.  My husband said, \"I don't have a gun.  I don't own a gun.  What I have is a Bible.  I'm  /a Christian.\"",

            "a Christian.\"  And they said, \"We want money.\"  And they also said to me, \"We want money.\"  And I was scared.  One of them stabbed me by knife and I was bleeding.  I got tired.  I was getting weaker.  I took money from my bag.  I had money inside a tin.  It was about R200,00.  I gave them this R200,00.  After I gave him this R200,00 he took my bag and he started throwing everything out and all the coins came out and he took them.  I held my hand because I was bleeding and I was getting tired.  My husband told him that he doesn't own a gun and my husband said, \"Okay, let's go to the bedroom.  I'll give you the money.\"  I don't know what happened but what I heard is that one of them said, \"Shoot,\" and that's when they started shooting.  I think they shot for about five times.  After that they came inside the house.  They wanted to shoot me.  I went to this guy who was holding a big machine gun and I said to him, \"Really, what have we done?\"  And one of them answered back and said, \"Let me just hit this one with this hammer.\"  And one of them went to my bedroom and he started searching.  He found the girl who was hiding under the bed and I was crying.  I was begging them not to kill that girl because I told them that this girl just came from rural areas.  She just came here to help me.  She's not from this area.  And they said to me, \"We don't want evidence or witnesses here,\" and that's when they started shooting at her.  And her intestines were outside.  Maybe this is something that I saw because I was scared and I was terrified but I think I saw intestines.  They took everything that belongs to me and my husband inside the house - television, my clothes, my husband's cloths.   They went to the kitchen, they ate my food and they were throwing everything down.  They took cool drinks and they drank because I was selling cool drinks.  They also took other stuff.  And I heard after they left and when I heard that there was no noise any longer, I went to the bedroom.  I called my husband and there was no answer.  I went closer.  I shook him and I realised that he was dead.  I went to another bedroom.  I called this other woman, Mrs Mnconco.  I heard her answering very softly and I said to her, \"Oh, are you still there?\"  She said, \"Yes, I am.\"  When I arrived where she was, I discovered that she can't do anything.  I told her that they've killed my husband and I told her that he's gone.  And she was crying I told her, \"Don't cry because they might come back because other stuff which they took from my house, it's still outside.  They might come back to fetch it.\"  So Mrs Mnconco said to me they shot her and one bullet came from the back and out to this 15-year-old girl to her cheek.  They had already set that bedroom alight and Mrs Mnconco tried to extinguish the fire.  We had a bottle of water in that bedroom and this 15-year-old girl took this bottle and tried to extinguish the fire.  Other stuff had burnt.  I said to this 15-year-old girl she must go out and tell people that we are injured and my husband is now dead.  It was at about 8 o'clock.  This thing started at about 6.00pm.  I didn't realise that this girl was confused because she seemed not to understand whatever I was saying to her and then I decided to go to my neighbour's.  I went to one of my neighbours.  I told them that my husband has been killed and they said to me, \"There's nothing we can  /do because",

            "Thank you very much for coming and telling us this story today.  There was a time not long ago in the 1970s the 1980s when the people in your area around Ulundi, Mahlabatini, lived very happily side by side.  Some people leant towards the IFP, some people favoured the other parties, what was then the UDF, but most people, in fact most people did not have very strong political views and certainly they didn't hold views for which they were prepared to kill and die for.  And over the past months, while we've been listening to evidence all round this province, there's overwhelming evidence that members of the previous government, senior policemen, politicians, manipulated the politics in this province in order to set people against each other so as to prevent the people of KwaZulu/Natal from forming a common united front against that previous government and its policies.  The violence in this province has only been going on for about 10 or 11 years since the mid-eighties and it is time that the people of this province cast their minds back to those days when they lived happily together, when they lived peacefully together,  when there was peace between the IFP and the ANC and to remember their common humanity in order that they can move forward together.  So thank you again.  You've told us a very sad story.  We hope that it has helped you and your family a little bit to be able to come here and tell it in front of all of us and in front of the television and we hope that you are able to stay together as a family and support each other.  Thank you very much indeed.\n/MR LYSTER",

It's very brave of you to come all this way to talk about the disappearance of your father-in-law and to tell us what happened to two other members of your family.  We know that the South African Police were involved in many, many abductions, particularly from Swaziland, and they carried out these abductions in complete violation of international law.  They went to Swaziland, they killed people in Swaziland.  They abducted people from Swaziland and brought them back here and often tortured them and killed them in this country.  We will obviously do everything that we can to find out what happened to your father-in-law.  We can't guarantee that we will be successful but we will certainly try and we hope that just the fact that you have come here today and have talked about it in public is helping you help your family in Swaziland to come to  terms with his disappearance and there is the possibility, of course, that we will find out what happened to him.  We will speak to the policeman concerned, Mr Schoon, to see whether he can tell us where your father-in-law is and we will communicate that information to you and hopefully we will be able to get to the bottom of this.  So again thank you very much for coming and telling us this important story.

            "  I'm a researcher and a lecturer at the University of Natal and I have been doing research in the province for the past 17 years and I have been quite actively involved in research since the 1980s in the North Coast region.  I started off doing research on a variety of topics including customs and activities involving the sale of liquor in the Empangeni, Gingindlovu, Eshowe area.  And then I also became involved in monitoring violence in the mid-eighties and as part of my violence monitoring activities, I was working together with the Progressive Federal Party unrest monitoring group which subsequently became the Democratic Party group and that was co-ordinated by the then provincial regional director of  /the PFP,",

            "MR LYSTER",
            "the PFP, then DP, Roy Ainsley and we were also working together with Eve Jenkin.  And this monitoring group received a lot of calls for assistance from people in the whole province really - South Coast, North Coast, Durban - and not just personal calls but also telephonic calls which involved us all in a lot of interventionist work, trying to get police patrols, trying to get army patrols, and later on trying to get cases followed up by the police.  So my research experience that I bring to this Commission today has involved me in academic research activities as well as specific violence monitoring activities.  When I started doing research in this area in the eighties, the North Coast region was very different to what it is today.  With a few exceptions, namely Mandini and to some extent Esikhawini where there was trade union activity, there was very little political polarisation.  There was peace.  People who were perhaps inclined to the ANC or the IFP were co-existing quite happily together.  And in my research activities I had a wide range of contacts from people who were in all political organisations and many people who were not particularly political.  But as the DP unrest group continued its work, we increasingly got calls especially up the North Coast from people who were linked to trade unions and to the ANC/COSATU/UDF because of the attacks which they were subject to.  They were calling for help.  But I want to stress that so were a lot of other people.  People who were not linked to political organisations of any sort and we helped them regardless of who they were.  That's the background.  That's why I'm here today to talk about what's been  happening in terms of the security force involvement in this violence up the North Coast.  Now, the contention of this submission - my contention is that the security forces must bear the prime responsibility for the destabilisation of the North Coast, that the police in particular are largely responsible for the type of polarisation that we see today and the suffering of both IFP and ANC members as well as people with no political affiliations at all.  And the army as well is guilty to a certain extent although their involvement is less obvious.  The involvement of the police was very conspicuous.  Either the police did not act when you asked them to or the police were part of the - the part of the actual attacking mechanism.  Sometimes quite overtly, openly, and sometimes in a more sinister, shadowy force - what has become known as the third force.  What was apparent from the very beginning as the violence escalated towards the late eighties but particular from 1990 when there was a change of political dispensation set in motion, was the extent to which the violence was orchestrated.  Up the North Coast there was a lot of local level conflict between IFP and ANC supporters but the major thrust of the violence was far more deeply rooted and more sinister than that.  What we noticed was a similar pattern in area after area.  People would be threatened with attack.  People would be attacked.  Sometimes you would warn the police but the police were not around and the attackers moved in.  And very often the attackers were not local people.  They were people brought into the area from outside of the area and one of the people who was very conspicuous  in the patterns of violence which developed in the late eighties and nineties was Thomas Tshabalala and people closely associated with him from Lindelani in Durban.  Now, the point I'm trying to make is that a lot of the violence was not started, was not actively fermented by local people, local IFP, ANC supporters.  It was deliberately stirred up in a variety of ways from outside and I have mentioned Tshabalala because his name crops up in virtually all the areas up the North Coast which were conflict-ridden and he is known to have a very close relationship with the police.  He is suspected of having links with Military Intelligence and he is known to have sat on the Joint Management Council structures set up by the P W Botha regime.  Now, what I'm going to do - that's the general pattern that one observed, particularly from the 1990s.  I want to go through it area by area just to give an idea of the types of conflict which developed in specific areas within that particular broad pattern that I've outlined.  That is, a certain amount of local level conflict but a great deal of conflict which appeared clearly orchestrated in collusion, overt or covert collusion, with the security forces.  So let me just go through these areas very briefly.  This is not a detailed breakdown of incidents of violence in the areas.  That would take us all day, all week, all month probably.  A lot of information is available in the records of violence monitors' reports that have been put out, Goldstone Commission Report, Transitional Executive Committee Reports, etcetera, etcetera.  The detail is there.  Our records are available to the researchers  from the Truth Commission, obviously provided a degree of confidentiality is maintained about sources.  I want to highlight some of the major patterns starting with the Mandini area.  And the Mandini area was one of the earliest affected areas, if not the earliest affected area, on the North Coast.  The violence started in the mid/latter eighties in that area because of the activities which were generated by the industries in the area, namely trade unionists.  And what we noticed both up the North Coast and in the whole province is that trade unionists from the very inception of powerful grassroots-supported trade unions became the target of attacks by vigilantes, by hit squads and by police.  In this Mandini was no exception.  The earliest instances of violence occurred there.  The violence escalated in the latter eighties when the KwaZulu Police took over policing in the township.  And from then on most of the reports of violence were linked very closely to the activities of the KwaZulu Police and particularly the management of the KwaZulu Police in the form of Major Owen Zama who was, in many of the attacks which took place in 1990 and onwards, seen to be present when people were shot, sjamboked, houses burnt.  He was actually witnessed to be physically present.  So the violence in Sundumbili, Isithebe, areas around there was very much linked to the activities of the KwaZulu Police in the area.  Now, one person of particular note in these activities in the early nineties was a notorious hit squad person called Jerry Mdanda.  Jerry Mdanda was a widely feared hit squad person.  He was very highly trained.  He was a Mozambican believed to have had links  /with",

            "with Renamo.  He was linked to violence in a number of areas - Umlazi, what is now Gauteng, what is now Mpumalanga and also up the North Coast.  Whilst in Mandini he was working together with the KwaZulu Police and a local chief who is allegedly deeply implicated in the violence.  Mdanda was linked to a number of killings in Mandini and was never ever brought to book.  I've mentioned one example in my submission where Mdanda was arrested together with another feared man called Bongani Mthimkhulu.  They were arrested by a member of the police in Sundumbili following two murders in 1990 and after Mthimkhulu threatened to become Nofamela No 2, which of course relates to the famous hit squad revelations, and demanded to phone Brigadier Mathe, there was intervention by senior members of the KwaZulu Police, including Captain Manzini and Hlengwa, and Mdanda and Mthimkhulu were released from the custody of the police and taken to the home of a prominent IFP leader in Esikhawini.  That's not the only time that Mdanda was arrested and released after intervention by senior policemen.  And not only KwaZulu policemen;  the same thing happened in Durban and he was released after intervention by some of the most senior members of the South African Police in Umlazi in 1985.  So those were some of the major patterns which emerged in the Mandini area and in fact I also give an example in my submission of what was quite typical.  Ainsley, in his role as Democratic Party president of the unrest monitoring group wrote to Minister Vlok warning about attacks in an area called Nembe and Vlok responded and said the matter would receive attention by the police, senior policemen.   /The police",

            "MR LYSTER",
            "The police never ever bothered to get in touch with Ainsley and the situation worsened.  More people died.  There was no intervention.  Now, that was fairly typical.  We have a lot of correspondence.  We have a lot of records of appeals to the police which were totally ignored.  So they can't say they didn't know.  That was the Mandini area.  Eshowe - I'm just moving up gradually northwards - Eshowe was relatively quiet until 1990.  What I find very noticeable, these areas where I worked fairly closely with people in the eighties which were so peaceful, suddenly from 1990 became transformed into violent war-torn zones.  It is not possible for this to have happened without a degree of orchestration and organisation.  One of the early instances in January 1990 in Eshowe was allegedly perpetrated by, amongst other people, a person attached to the KwaZulu Police.  The violence escalated tremendously from 1993 onwards.  Now, Eshowe was policed by members of the South African Police and what the police - the government did was to bring into the area KwaZulu policemen which was directly contradictory to their stated policy of reserving certain areas for the KwaZulu Police and certain for the SAP.  It was also completely contrary to the recommendations of the Goldstone Commission which had said that no more policing areas should be handed to KwaZulu.  Following the introduction of the KwaZulu Police into the area the violence intensified dramatically and there were many killings in 1993 and 1994.  It continued after the elections.  There were four people constantly named by people in Eshowe as perpetrators of violence, key perpetrators.  Two of  these people had very clear police connections.  One of them was a person who was at that time a policeman and has since become the chief of the area, B I Zulu.  The other person was supposedly a nephew of B I Zulu who moved to the area around the early 1990s.  His name is Thulani Ngcobo and he at one stage was believed to have been a KwaZulu policeman but it seems that he was one of these special constables.  Thulani Ngcobo was notorious in the killings in Pietermaritzburg and was linked to dozens if not hundreds of instances of violence and political killings including, allegedly, the killing of prominent trade unionist Jabu Ndlovu and her family in Pietermaritzburg.  Thulani Ngcobo settled in Eshowe and maintained his links with the police and also maintained a reputation for being deeply involved in instances, cases of violence.  Now, what all this suggests is that this was allowed to happen by both the government and by the police management.  Again we had - and I say we, monitors and also Amnesty International - had sent a number of appeals to the police regarding policing powers, asking for protection for people and our calls went unheeded in Eshowe as elsewhere.  In Mtunzini area, I don't go into detail there but the pattern was the same, that there was a series of attacks, particularly in the period 1991/92/93 in various areas in the magisterial district of Mtunzini and around the town itself and the pattern was the same all the time.  The police would be warned about attacks, would take no precautionary steps and would not investigate afterwards.  This is all documented in the records that we kept during that time.

            "to the Richards Bay/Empangeni area.  Now, there were a number of areas affected by violence around these two towns Empangeni and Richards Bay including Ngwelezana, including rural areas as we've heard this morning, and including Ntambanana, and in all of these areas again the role of the police is very conspicuous.  But the most prominent part played by the police was in the Esikhawini area.  The Esikhawini area and, as I mentioned earlier, the Mandini area and Eshowe, but particularly in Esikhawini - before I touch on Esikhawini I must also mention that Nseleni itself was also a target of attacks by groups of outsiders in the presence of the police who did nothing to stop them.  In an affidavit mentioning an attack in 1990 by ANC officer bearer Bongani Msomi, he gives details of watching the attacks on the houses taking place and he mentions how a particular policeman called Duffles - that we heard of this morning - address the group of armed attackers, did nothing to disarm them ,just told them to disperse after they'd attacked because the police were there to look after them.  The only action the police took against the people under attack was to disarm them before the attackers moved in.  And Msomi is recorded as saying to Duffles, \"I'm worried about what's left in my house, that it will be looted.\"  And sure enough, after he left the area, his house was looted.  No action whatsoever was taken.  When we get to Esikhawini, however, we see, of course, the virtual epicentre of hit squad activities.  We see in Esikhawini high levels of collusion between the KwaZulu Police in the area who were operating hit squads.  This has come out in court  in the trial of Mbambo Mkhize and Hlongwane.  We see collusion between them and management of the SA Police and including especially the security police in Empangeni.  And the situation in Esikhawini has been detailed on many occasions.  There's a vast body of information about it.  I myself gave evidence to the Goldstone Commission sitting here in Empangeni at the beginning of 1993.  There are a number of reports, submissions, court records on the activities and I just want to touch on some that have perhaps not been highlighted as much as they should have been.  I'm just going to mention some of the particularly important incidents in Esikhawini which show us the nature of the forces at work and first of all one of the earliest incidents - I say one of the earliest incidents because there were killings before that - there were two attacks on trade unionist Geoffrey Belani.  There were other murders - but in one of the earliest attacks on the youth, two youths disappeared at the beginning of July 1990.  Their mothers searched for them frantically.  Their bodies were found two weeks later in the township itself.  While the mothers were searching for their children, the one mother went to the local police and they taunted her.  She was worried out of her mind about her child but all they could do was laugh at her.  She went to the security police in Empangeni and they said, \"No, don't come to us.  That's a KwaZulu Police matter.  We're not going to have anything to do with it.\"  The bodies were found two to two and a half weeks later.

            "- she was called Mrs Nxumalo, and Mrs Nxumalo's son - she described to me the state of the body.  It had had acid poured over the head so there was no skin left on the head.  It was just a skull.  The body was not decomposed.  The mothers thought that the boys had been kept somewhere and then, because the bodies were not as decomposed as one would have thought after two, two and a half weeks, but they had deliberately poured acid over the bodies to mutilate them and prevent - possibly to prevent identification.  The suffering of these women did not end there.  The one family was Inkatha supporting and the other family was ANC supporting and the police deliberately stirred up animosity between these two women at the time of the funerals.  They went out of their way to spoil the funerals and one policeman said to Mr Nxumalo, \"We know that your son's funeral is just a pretext for an ANC meeting.\"  You just wonder how people can bring themselves to do this sort of thing to some people who have lost their children like that.  The policeman that spoke to Mrs Nxumalo, whose name she gave me, appears to be the same person who is now working with the team of the investigative task unit in Durban and one wonders how he got into that unit.  Now, the killing of these two boys was widely believed to be one of the reasons that Dr Henry Luthuli, a prominent medical practitioner in the township, was shot dead in early August 1990.  Mrs Luthuli is going to give evidence to the Commission tomorrow and I'm sure she will tell you the terrible pain and suffering she went through, especially even after the death of her husband when people put out rumours that she had killed her  husband which is another dirty trick tactic that one sees used time after time.  It happened, I remember, in Durban when Mrs Mxenge was killed.  People tried to say, \"Well, you know, it was just a jealous husband, or wife, or whatever.\"  Now, Mrs Luthuli suffered terribly and one of the reasons that people in the township thought that her husband might have been killed was that he had possibly done port mortems on these two boys and discovered that they had been shot by the KwaZulu Police hit squads.  As it happens, it has transpired that Dr Luthuli did indeed do a second post mortem on the Nxumalo boy and the case is currently before an inquest court.  But what has emerged so far - the matter's been postponed now until December - what has emerged so far in the killing of Dr Luthuli is that it is very possibly linked to a Vlakplaas operative working in collusion with the Empangeni security police and the KwaZulu Police but the matter is, of course, still under - the proceedings are carrying on but that is the evidence that has been led so far linking it possibly to Vlakplaas.  So we see right from 1990 very clear hit squad activities surfacing in Esikhawini Township.  Now, these activities escalated dramatically in '91/92, '92 in particular, and killings were the order of the day.  And at the height of this in August 1992, which was a black month - at least 31 people were killed in instances of violence in that month alone, most of them just shot dead by people often wearing balaclavas - and at the height of this Ainsley and I were contacting the police and begging them to put SAP patrols in the Esikhawini area because it was a KwaZulu Police  jurisdiction area and everybody knew that the KwaZulu Police were implicated in this violence and yet the police refused to act.  At one stage a general in Pretoria had agreed to send in the SAP and we were told that the general had been reprimanded by Minister Heunis Kriel who said that he had no right to interfere.  The question of the KwaZulu Police was a very delicate matter.  Now, I hold the whole government culpable because people were dying, they were being told about it.  Ainsley and I launched public appeals to government officials, to the Goldstone Commission, to diplomats, and Amnesty International launched appeals.  I wrote to President de Klerk himself in connection with the Luthuli case in 1993.  I asked De Klerk to intervene.  I did this through a colleague of his.  De Klerk, in spite of my having put in my letter the connection with the KwaZulu Police hit squads, passed the matter on to the Minister Kriel who passed it on to the KwaZulu Police to deal with.  So they were given the chance to intervene and they did not take it.  To me that implies culpability in the deaths of innocent people.  Also in that August attack, three of the attackers were injured and admitted to hospital under false names and addresses and Ainsley and I observed in that period a massive degree of cover-up and collusion between members of the South African Police, including Colonel Nel from Eshowe.  There were a number of other matters needing attention in Esikhawini.  Reports were received in 1992, for example, that a notorious KwaZulu Police killer, Simpiwe Mvuyani was operating in the area.  Mvuyani was known to be linked to a mandrax cartel and I think it's time that  /the link",

        [
            "MR LYSTER",
            "the link between the mandrax cartel and the KwaZulu Police is investigated.  There were also reports that a notorious killer known as the Beast in Policeman's Clothing, Kethane Shange, who'd been released from prison after serving a few months of a long sentence, was operating in the area.  One wonders what happened to his parole.  He was supposed to have been paroled.  We need to find out why these things were allowed to happen.  Then, in another incident in February 1992, there was an attack on the hostels at Esikhawini in which at least 12 people died and the police did not intervene until it was apparent that the hostel dwellers were defending themselves against the attackers, most of whom had been bused into the area from outside.  The police then intervened and arrested the hostel dwellers.  At the same time a vehicle was intercepted near Durban that day full of weapons for Esikhawini.  It was a car driven by a man called Mlangeni who had spent the night at the house of Thomas Tshabalala.  Mlangeni is believed to have links with training activities as Sasolburg.  The vehicle was stopped at a road block and I then followed up the case.  These weapons were destined for Esikhawini.  The case was allowed to lapse implying a cover-up between Durban murder and robbery unit and Thomas Tshabalala.  The people were never brought to book.  Tape recordings that were made in the area at the time, which will be given to the Truth Commission which have already featured in a newspaper report and which have been authenticated by Mbambo Mkhize and Co, point to a massive degree of collusion between senior KwaZulu Police particularly Brigadier Mzimela and IFP officials  in the area including cover-ups of illegal weapons.  Also implicated in these tapes are members of the security police at Empangeni.  So you can see that Esikhawini particularly was the very centre of these activities.  Policemen who tried to do their jobs properly were victimised.  I can mention a sergeant, a long-serving sergeant, Sergeant Moses Mthembu, who, because he was not going along with these activities, there was an attempt to transfer him to an area where he would have been killed.  He knew that and he took medical early retirement.  He has not to this day been paid his money.  This is three years later.  He was medically boarded.  He has not received his pension monies yet and he attributes this to deliberate blockage by the KwaZulu Police and names in particular Brigadier Mzimela and Colonel Reid, former head of the legal services who's now the head of police legal services in Durban.  And this is a point that we will come back to in a minute when I finish off.  Just moving on from Esikhawini to KwaMbonambi, I won't go into details there but again I think we've heard one story this morning.  A great deal of evidence about collusion between the police and the people perpetrating the violence and direct involvement of the police themselves in the violence.  We're all aware of the death of Simon Msweli, Michael Mthetwa and I think we know that they had been hiding in the forest away from the police for months before they were killed.  However, on three occasions an incendiary device was thrown at the Msweli house before Msweli was killed.  On one of those occasions an eyewitness reported seeing the very same Duffles in the  vicinity.  Finally Mtubatuba, most of the violence orchestrated by the police in Mtubatuba has happened after the end of 1993 and in that violence the commander of the internal stability is deeply implicated - Major, now Colonel, Pelser.  However, even before the end of 1993, the stability unit were engaged in killing people.  In September 1993 in the KwaMsani area they killed Alexander Velani and said to Mrs Velani afterwards, \"We're terribly sorry, Constance.  We didn't know it was your husband.\"  Now, that's a brief overview of why I'm saying that the police were deeply implicated.  I've given examples to try to show you that I'm not generalising without a vast body of information.  Now, arising out of this presentation are various issues.  The first is - and these, I think, are issues to be addressed by the Truth Commission - the first is the whole question of jurisdiction.  I want Minister Kriel to answer for the fact that he did not allow patrols into Esikhawini to save people's lives in spite of having been given evidence and having direct appeals as to why it was necessary to send in the army and the SAP.  The SAP also are problematic but at least they weren't the people in Esikhawini who were directly killing people and covering up because the KwaZulu Police were covering up afterwards as well.  Kriel must answer for this.  So must the Commissioner of Police, the management of the police.  Why were they putting KwaZulu Police in an SAP area at Eshowe to sew destabilisation, to polarise a formerly peaceful community and yet they were not prepared to allow SAP patrols at Esikhawini?   Secondly, is political interference in the work of the  police.  There are two examples here.  One of them relates to an incident in Esikhawini at the height of the trouble in early '93.  A new Police Commissioner has been appointed, General During.  During tried, at the request of the community, to transfer two of the key trouble makers, Brigadier Mzimela and Captain Manzini, out of the area.  He was overruled by the then Minister of Police, Minister Buthelezi.  Why?  Why?  The second instance relates to the presence - to the whole question of the army.  Last year, during some trouble at Sundumbili, I had quite an interesting conversation with the senior army officer at Eshowe.  I was asking the army to go into Sundumbili and he said, \"Well, the former Minister of Police in KwaZulu expressly forbad us from going into Sundumbili or Esikhawini.\"  Now, why?   I think we need answers to those questions.  Why, when those were the two centres where most people were dying, was the presence of the army forbidden to protect people?  The failure of President de Klerk to do anything.  President de Klerk cannot say he didn't know.  We have copies of correspondence.  We have a letter from him.  We have the Goldstone Commission which itself knew about what was happening yet had to act within the confines of the limits set by President de Klerk.  I think President de Klerk must be called to explain why.  Why did he not allow the Goldstone Commission to investigate the Luthuli matter?  The failure to secure further prosecutions against hit squads.  We want answers from people why, in spite of well over a hundred in a short space of time in Esikhawini, has there only been one conviction?  Why have we not prosecuted other  people?  Why have we not prosecuted the people behind it?  Why at the trial of Qi Mkhize and Co were the politicians and the senior police people, including General Mathe and Brigadier Mzimela not called to give evidence?  Why?  We also need to move - when I say to move, we need to do something about these individual policeman that we've been hearing about.  And I have a whole list of them here which is by no means exhaustive. And when I say do something about it, we need to find out why they haven't applied for amnesty.  We need to find out where they are now, what they're doing.  We need to find ways of neutralising them so that they cannot carry on doing it.  And I can tell you, because the violence continues, that this man Duffle, that we have heard about this morning, is still deeply involved in the violence and has been interfering in the work of a unit up the North Coast at the moment, a competent investigative unit headed by Captain Vilekazi, and has tried to interfere with the evidence - the very same Duffle.  We want these factors removed.  We want the management structures of the police held accountable.  We want the management structures of Eshowe under Colonel Yunius and Colonel Nel, we want individual policemen at Eshowe, B I Zulu, Captain Rielly - all these people have been implicated.  We want the management structures in other areas, Empangeni, Umfolozi stability unit and the individual members I've mentioned - Duffle, Masa - Masa who was transferred out of Empangeni because of his activities.  We want the activities of the Empangeni security police exposed including Messrs de Jager, Greef, Bevan - Bevan is one  of the prime movers at the moment in interfering with police investigative work right now.  Well, he was until he was neutralised through huge effort, but he's been temporarily removed.  But we want these activities exposed.  We want to know why many of these police I've mentioned, why there names appear on a list of people wanting blanket amnesty from President de Klerk.  Have they applied to the Truth Commission?  If not, why not?  We need answers.  And, of course, most of all we want the political strategy behind it.  What all this points to is a degree of organisation which linked up with State resources.  You cannot engage in this scale of destabilisation without massive back-up and everything points to the sinister joint management structures, from the presence in areas such as Eshowe of Thomas Tshabalala and Themba Khoza to the co-ordinated activities which led to the violence.  It all points to joint management structures.  We want government accountability.  Finally, why is it necessary?  Why is it necessary to expose these people?  Why is it necessary?  Well, I think for the reasons that are intrinsic to the work of the Truth Commission plus the situation that we're in at the moment.  First of all, this region is not yet at peace.  There is a tremendous amount of violence out there still.  Much of it goes unreported.  Much of it is passed off as faction or criminal or taxi, but it's much more than that.  There's reason to think the people are still training, people are still arming themselves and these very same police that I've been mentioning are still sitting in the police structures.  We want them exposed.  We want them  removed.  We want them neutralised so that we can create a climate of peace.  So that we can heal the divisions between the IFP and the ANC and the other political parties.  As I said to you, these divisions were not present in the 1980s.  They were fuelled deliberately to polarise, to destabilise, to prevent development.  We want reconciliation.  We want people to make friends with each other.  We want them to put aside this violence and they can only do that if there is a climate of peace, if they feel safe to do that.  That's why we must have these people exposed.  So we want the Commission to look into all these aspects.  We want them to ensure that the people who were involved in this destabilisation work in the past are removed from positions in which they can continue their activities in the future.  We want to encourage these people and perhaps we need to encourage them by the big stick and saying, \"We are going to prosecute.\"  We want to encourage these people to come forward while they still have time.  People like Duffle.  People like Bevan.  People like De Jager.  People like Mzimela and Mathe.  We would prefer them to come forward and seek amnesty and tell us what was happening but, if not, we want to make sure that justice takes its course.",

So Shabani said he did not want my land.  He only wanted the portion that was given to him.  He did not want the rest of the land and Shabani reiterated his statement that the part of land that was given to  him by Msweli was quite enough.  He didn't want to take any more of Msweli's land.  Then I went to Ngwelezana to report the matter.  I went to the Home Affairs Department together with him, the reverend, and I reported the matter.  The reverend told them at Home Affairs that he did not want to take my husband's land and they chased me and said I shouldn't come back with this matter.  They sent summonses several times and the third time I took the summonses to Ngwelezana.   We were called to Ngwelezana so that we would reach a settlement as to our argument.  There was the chief as well as the induna and the magistrate said I should address the court.  The magistrate asked as to where the chief was coming from and where he got the authority to allocate people's land.  It was a white magistrate who was presiding over the case.  Then the induna said I had a very big place.  I said to him I was not speaking to him, I was speaking to the chief and I wanted to asked the chief as to how do they plan to take my land whilst I was ploughing on my land and I had planted my land.  I was farming on it.  And I told the chief to go and look at my place and decide whether I was not using the land.  Then, if I was not using the land, it should be given to other people.  The magistrate reiterated that and said he will send someone to go and check whether I was using the land fruitfully and the matter was thought to be resolved and when we went out of the court, I had planted mealies in the field and I had planted all sorts of vegetables.  I was really working on that field.  Then after this was supposedly resolved we were at home one day and we saw a group of people coming.  They took  out a document which they were reading.  I said to them they must give me that document so that I could read it by myself.  They said they were sent by the chief.  They said they were the chief's police and they came.  They were heavily armed and they said they were sent by the induna.  They said they had come to undo the fence that was around my field.  I went to KwaMbonambi and I called another boy from the Shandu family to accompany me.  We went to KwaMbonambi and the police asked me as to whether we had fought.  I told them that the people were heavily armed.  I couldn't have fought with them.  I had just come to report the matter.  And they also had guns at that time.  And I went to KwaMbonambi.  When I got to KwaMbonambi and related the story, they said to me if we had fought or we had had a problem or somebody was injured they could have come but now that there was nothing going on, they did not attack me, they did not kill anyone, so they couldn't come.  They sent me to Ngwelezana.  When I came back, I found that they had undone the fence and they had taken out the poles that support the fence and they went to throw the fence at my place and my plants were exposed to animals such as cattle.",

I paid him R250,00 and he promised that he was going to go to Ngwelezana to open up a case and the magistrate said he was not prepared to preside over my case thereafter because he had dealt with it sufficiently.  Then he said I should sue for damages that I had incurred with regard to what the people or the police from the induna's place had done.  So my attorney reported thereafter and said the magistrate said there was nothing he could do.  So it was Makhathini, myself as well as Musa's wife and my children, we went to the fields and I brought a certain document and gave it to Van Hellen.  And I think they bribed Van Hellen because thereafter he couldn't even look me in the eye.  He couldn't face me.  And now the damages were not paid.  Simon said he was going to re-erect the fence that was taken out as well as the poles and the youth from Nseleni used to attack my son and I told him that he should stop being at Khombindlela and he left Khombindlela and went to start at another school.

It's a story we have heard so often from people in this province - from women, women who, as I said yesterday, didn't participate in the violence, were not active in it at all and yet they suffered most from it because they lost their loved ones, their sons and their husbands, and we do extend our very deep sympathy to you.  Your colleague or your friend Ntombikanina Mthetwa  /told\ntold us yesterday about her son's death and now you have come today and told us about Simon's death and we know that they died together and we were glad that you were able to come to the Commission together, you and Michael Mthetwa's mother and tell your stories to us.  As you've told us and as other witnesses have told us and as Mrs Mary de Haas has told us today, there was a very strong relationship, there were very strong links between the police in this area, the stability unit and the police from KwaMbonambi and certain local indunas and other people and clearly it was as a result of this close co-operation and the close links between that induna and the police that your family was attacked or singled out for attack and that your sons died.  And even though you know the name of the policeman who killed your son, Steyn - even though that person was locked up, it's still not good enough.  It doesn't satisfy you.  It doesn't satisfy us, the fact that he is in gaol, because the system that created him is still in place and that is something that we have to fight against until we have a police force that we can all feel safe with and be proud of.

You have expressed some of the frustration that other people have expressed over the  last day and a half, particularly about the ability of the police to investigate these cases properly and it seems as though the policeman that prevented the proper investigation of this case was a policeman who has already been mentioned this morning, B I Zulu, that just as after arrests were made and people were about to be charged - that this particular policeman who has a very long reputation and a bad reputation came in and prevented the investigation from taking place and it's very frustrating for you and for many other people to see that these policemen are still holding positions of power and influence and we hope that some day soon in this province that sort of thing will be something that we can put behind us and that the police are people that we can look up to when we are in times of need and people that we can trust.  We will do what we can to investigate this matter and report that to you if we are able to make any headway on it.  But we thank you for coming in and giving us this information.

(Laughter in audience) Please, I would like to give Mrs Simelane the same respect as anybody else.  I think our Chairperson has mentioned again here that we want to respect every witness who comes here because all the people who come here have suffered in the same way.  So if you could just give that respect.  Please feel free, Mrs Simelane and explain or relate your story.   ---   We are Inkatha members in my family.  Most of the time we used to go to Ulundi.  We were the people who were at the frontline of Inkatha.  We used to travel a lot to Ulundi and back to Matshana.  This time it was before Inkatha and any other organisation got into conflict.  Later youth started getting involved in politics.  That's when the youth started fighting each other.  Me and my husband, we were Inkatha members but we were staying at the area where there were ANC people.  We heard after a time that people were killing each other now.  We heard that Inkatha and ANC people were now killing each other.  As time goes on, one day there was someone who lost three children at a time and there was a funeral on that house and we saw people shooting each other.  Then we decided not to go to that funeral.  We didn't attend that funeral.  Then we heard that this war or violence was getting worse.  ANC and Inkatha people were killing each other.  One day me and my husband, we were working.  We came back home from work.  We found my daughter, the one that I'm with here, it was on Wednesday, and she told us that there were people who were pointing at my house and we were confused.  We didn't know what was going on and all we knew is that we didn't have any enemies.  It was on Wednesday.  On Thursday, again on Friday, my husband  and I woke up and we left for work and later my husband came home and I told him, \"Why are you coming home late because you know we are scared now?\" and I asked my husband if he brought something for me and he said no.  And I sent my child to go to a shop to buy something to eat because my husband didn't bring anything.  When my child came back from the shop, he said, \"Grandfather, grandfather, there are people outside there and there are many and they are wearing balaclavas.\"  And when I greeted them, they didn't greet me back.  Then I took the meat from the child.  I put it inside the pot.  Soon after that, they came.  I was with my daughter, the one that I'm with here now, and my daughter said to me she's now scared.  Her tummy is now running.  She said she was going to the toilet and I was left there and I said to myself, \"Oh Lord, let your will be done.  Today it's me.\"  Just seconds after they left, they were at the door, banging the door.  I was sitting there facing the door and I asked them, \"Who are you?\"  They said, \"It's us.\"  I said, \"Who?\"  They said, \"Us.  Open the door, you will see us.\"  And then the third time they just broke the door.   My husband came to the door because he realised that they were going to shoot me because I was facing the door and when my husband arrived at the door, that's when they shot my husband.  I didn't even hear the noise.  All I saw, it was a bullet going through my husband's head and he fell down.  (Witness becomes emotionally upset.)",

I put my hand on my husband and I realised that he wasn't breathing and I asked them, \"What have we done?\"  They didn't say anything at that time and then I asked them for the second time, \"Why are you shooting at us?\"  One of them said, \"Because you have guns,\" and I said to him, \"My child, where are the guns?\"  They said, \"Yes, you do have guns.  They came from Ulundi.\"  And then I said to them, \"Now that you've killed him, you can go ahead, search the house and find the guns.\"  They went inside.  They took my husband and then they shot him for the second time and the third time.  Then they dropped him down.  I don't know what happened because they got inside the house.  They went to my living-room.  They went to the television.  They opened the wall unit.  They took everything which was inside there and one of the shelves was locked and they said to me, \"Bring the key.\"  I said, \"Even if I knew where the key was but now I can't remember where the key is because I'm now confused and terrified.\"  And one guy kicked the door twice and it broke.  We had bought cattles to pay lobola for my son at that time.  When I saw them kicking my wall unit, some of them were in my bedroom sitting on my bed.  We had money put in platics in that shelf.  Some of them slashed my husband's pockets and they found money.  Some of them went to my bedroom and they took my bag and searched my bag and they took my money.  It was on a payday that day, so they took all my money from my bag.  And I also had money from my stokvel and I asked them, \"What have we  done?\"  One of them said, \"If you think, what have you done?\"  So I told them I didn't know.  There was also a child, I think he was 13 years old, he said, \"Just shoot this person so that she stops talking.\"  I was bleeding.  I got hurt from my leg.  I don't know what hurt me because I was confused.  I think I also got hurt when they were shooting my husband.  After they finished that, taking everything from my house, they left.  I tried to stand up and then I realised that I was hurt.  I thought they were going to go to another bedroom to search for my sons and I realised that they were not going there.  That's when I started screaming and they went up and they met in a certain corner.  They went up the hill.  After that my daughter came out and she ran.  She was trying to get help from other people because we didn't realise that my husband was dead.  We thought maybe my husband has lost consciousness and he'll get well as soon as he arrives in hospital.  My daughter tried to get help and they didn't do anything to her except that they were irritating her, trying to stop her and she came back without getting any help from anyone and she said, \"I couldn't get any help.  I couldn't get any car to take my father to hospital.\"  And then she left again.  She went up the hill.  In that area, that's where they were making their arms and my daughter found them there.  At about 3.00 we were still sitting at home.  We were terrified and we couldn't sleep.  Policemen came to our house.  And one child went to another house and they asked for a telephone to make a call to the police, that's when the police van came and that's when I realised that my husband is dead because  the police put him inside a plastic bag.",

As you heard Dr Magwaza saying, if we are here, everyone before us is equal.  It doesn't matter what political organisation one belongs in.  We grew up as youth.  We used to fight ourselves but we never experienced anything like this.  It's obvious that a third force came between Africans and it took away ubuntu and the Truth Commission is trying by all means to give it back to the people, to bring ubuntu back to the people that you know you can go anywhere and meet anyone and not be scared.  Even if you're ANC or IFP, it doesn't matter, everyone is equal.  We want people to stay the same and live the same.  I'm here and I'm supporting Richard Lyster on this one that, like he said yesterday, that we don't like to come here and hear evidence from one side of the organisation.  We want Inkatha people as well to be here to come and give their testimony because our job is to put together people and to go back as we used to live.  Thanks.  ",

Mrs Simelane and your daughter,  /we thank\nwe thank you very much for coming in here today and telling your very sad story in front of this big crowd, in front of the televisions.  It is a very, very sad story.  You were a treasurer of the IFP in your area and, for reasons that you don't understand, your husband was taken from you.  He was killed.  You sat here like we did and you listened to the previous witness, who was Mrs Msweli, and you must have heard the pain and the suffering that she went through.  She was also treasurer of the IFP in her area.  However, she resigned and she joined the ANC.  But she, like you, was an ordinary person, a law abiding person, an upright, upstanding person, a strong woman and she suffered a terrible loss, the death of her son at the hands of the IFP and I think what's important about the fact that you are both sitting here under the same roof giving evidence together is that you can both come to understand the fact that violence - the violence that you have suffered, the violence that Mrs Msweli has suffered - brings us nothing except misery, brings us sadness and we hope that that mutual realisation from you from the IFP, from Mrs Msweli from the ANC can start bringing us together and bringing you as IFP and ANC together to a state where you were only ten years ago.  As I said earlier in my evidence, 10, 12 years ago people in this area were never killing each other.  They were living peacefully side by side and it's only in the last 10 or 12 years that this terrible violence has overtaken us and it's time that we started sitting down and talking to each other and not listening to those that are directing us from elsewhere.  Sitting down, talking to  each other and trying getting our lives back on track so that we can move forward together.  So again we thank you very much for coming in and telling us your story.  Thank you very much.",
