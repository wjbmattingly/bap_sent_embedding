This was a year after the ANC had been unbanned  in the country as a whole, but there was still serious problems in Bop about the rights of the ANC to actually operate freely.  It produced a lot of conflict and a lot of people were caught up in this conflict and you were one of those.

Can you ask Mr Mangope, because many things which has happened at home, if it was not because of him we could not have been in the problems we have.  There could not have been somebody who has been crippled.  So, can you ask Mr Mangope and Captain Selike.  To ask them why did they send police in our area, because we were living in peace and there were no conflict before.  There could not have been a person who has been crippled but immediately they entered our village, the conflict started.  We were living in peace but immediately they came, that's when we started to have problems.    I thought maybe if were, as I was saying this,  Mr Selike or Mr Mangope,  they could have been here,  they could have been here, so that they should be asked many questions that, what, what  were the reasons to them to come to Lekobo, because it seems they are responsible for our suffering.  That, that's the thing which disturbed me all the time.
