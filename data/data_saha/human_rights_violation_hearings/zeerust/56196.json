            "On the 5th of January 1991, I saw people, the Botswana police coming to the house.  They didn't want to listen what I wanted to tell them.  I asked them, what do you want, then they told me, when you say, what do want, what do you mean ?  When they were still talking that way, one of them said, this woman  and their daughter, they should be arrested, but  I asked them, what are you coming to do ?  Then I think I made a mistake by doing that.  Four police vans arrived at the gate.  They didn't want to hear anything.  My son was in the hippo, the second one ran away.  When they arrived, they said, the boy who was here, where is he ?  Then I told them that he has run away whilst you were looking.  They say, don't tell us nonsense, he's in the house, so I said to them open all the rooms and look for him.\n One of them went to look for a screwdriver in the Hippo, then opened the toilet, then he said, where is he ?  Then I told him that he has run away.  One of my daughters was hiding in the house, then they broke the front door, then they were able to open the kitchen door again.  They pulled my daughter, after assaulting me, they assaulted my daughter, then they dragged us and they were kicking us on the ribs.  They injured me on the neck  with the back of the gun.  A certain stout man said to me, I should climb over the Hippo.  Then I said, do you want me to climb the Hippo, take me, then he put a bench, then he said to me, I should climb the Hippo.  Then I was struggling to climb over, then he put a hand, his hand, his hand was so big.  I put my toe, feet on his hand, then I climbed together with my daughter.  Then whilst I was still in the air, he, he threw me inside the Hippo.  Therefore, he didn't even say excuse me.  Then  it was myself and my two children.  \n We, the place  was crowded.  They were hitting, they were assaulting us the way they wanted.  They dislocated my left arm,  they injured my neck, at the back of my neck, then they said my daughter should climb inside  the car boot.  They beat him  with canes.  When she tried to run away they would follow  her.  After that a certain boy said, kill these people, you're wasting time.  If it was myself, I could have shot them.  Then they put us into police vans.  They took us to Motswedi.  \n They made us to be on a queue and they were assaulting us  in whatever way.  They took us to the cells, they closed the doors.  We slept in that, in cells.  At 10 o'clock in the evening, they come to interrogate us, then they said, what were you arrested for ?  We said to them, we don't know why were arrested for.  They took us at 7 o'clock, and we didn't know what was happening at that time.  Then they asked us, who is your Chief in this area.  I told them that my Chief  is Segobodi.  Then they said, you say Segobodi ?  Segobodi is normally the Chief, so they said.  Then I told them that Segobodi is still a Chief.   Then the said, why don't you take Boputhatswana I.D. ?  Then they said, they asked us, why are we hating Boputhatswana.  We told them that we don't know the purpose of Boputhatswana.  They said, why do you take South African I.D. book ?  We told them that we grew up in South Africa.  If you say to them your Chief is Segobodi, they would assault you more and more.  Then they said to us, why don't you want to take Boputhatswana I.D. ?  I told them that I don't know whether Boputhas is going to be  deposed as it is.  In the morning we were taken.  They were pointing us with their guns and then said, go and kill people again.  If you kill them we'll come back to you.  That's how far I can go.",
