<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">LILIAN KADI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Lilian, welcome.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Thank you for coming.  You're coming to speak about a number of incidents that happened to many members of your family and in particular about Bennet Kadi.  Events which take place over quite a long period, beginning in 1993 and then extending right into 1994.  So, if you could please just go through what happened to your family and in particular to Bennet.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> It was on Thursday, at night, around 12 o'clock.  Somebody came and wake us up, saying people are crowded at the shop and they were singing ANC slogans and they are looting at the restaurant and the restaurant is burning.  That's why father walk up to that place.  When he arrived there he saw many people, therefore you couldn't do anything.  He turned back and went to the police next to the Botswana border.  He came with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a> When they arrived there the shop was gutted.  Then they went home whilst those people are still there.  They came home.  They found the police there and then the police shot them and they ran away, then the police were coming in many instances and protecting.  They would come for thirty minutes and leave.  After  four days, it was during the day and my parents were sitting under the tree, I was sleeping at that time, I could hear a sound but I thought I was dreaming, then I slept again.  Then I could hear stone throwing.  My parents ran away and went into the house and outside were full of people holding ANC flags and placards and throwing stones inside the house and the house was burning.  We were sitting inside the house not knowing what to do.  The house was burning, the floor was burning, the ceiling was burning and the ceiling was falling on the ground.  We would run to the rooms where there is no fire and later the whole house was gutted to the ground.  Not knowing what to do, we ran outside the house and they were throwing, still throwing stones.  A certain boy came to  help  me.  A  certain  one  came with a spear then he tried to stab me but the boy who helped me, protected me.  I was hit with stones and some of my teeth were removed, my two siblings were able to run away.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a> In the house was my father and my uncle and inside they were burnt by that fire, then they ran out, then my father wanted to jump the fence.  A certain boy came with a spade and slapped him and then he fell on the ground.  He was pulled outside but my uncle was able to run for a distance.  After that he was caught and there was a container of diesel, they were put just next to that container and they were slapped with those spades.  They took tyres which were outside and put them on their neck and they were burnt.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a> After that the police came after three hours they were taken and all of us, together with my, with my brother, we were taken to the hospital.  They took my father and my uncle to the mortuary.  The police came after two weeks to take the statement.  From there we submitted our statement, then we went to court but we were not  informed to come to court, but I went to the police station to ask them, why did they take statements and they don't want us to come to court, but the police said they were afraid of the confusion because those people would come, so they were waiting for come.  The court case proceeded.  Those people who were arrested, were given bail, because we gave them names of people who were leaders.  Even up to-day, we didn't go, the court case didn't proceed.  Even when, even to-day, they still say, they are still investigating about those people.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> That's true, I said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> And did they have any ANC T-shirts or flags or anything, or was it just that they were shouting ANC slogans ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> They were having ANC placards and ANC flags.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> These slogans, can you remember, can you tell us, give us an example of one of the slogans which was shouted ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> No, I cannot give you an example.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Now, before this, this incident  where your house was attacked and burnt were  there  any  other  clashes  between  your  father  and members of the village people, who you say, who you think belonged to the ANC ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> There was no conflict between my father and the local residents, but some members of the ANC, yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> And your father, did he ever speak about what was happening ?  Did he ever speak to you about what was happening ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> No, he was not communicating with us about that, in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> And your mother  at the time, where was she ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> Do you mean the time when they were burnt ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> That you're speaking about, where was your mother ?</p>

<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> But you say that the funeral that you organised, was very difficult because you said you were, that you were threatened all the time, can you tell us a bit  about that, about the actual funeral of your father, where it took place and how it was organised ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> There were no people who were coming to assist us with the preparations.  I was the only one who was running around looking for money, looking for caskets, looking for beasts and looking for groceries and that those people who would come to the funeral would have something to eat but there was nobody who was helping me even about the preparations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> You also say that you were harassed and that you were threatened during the time that you were trying to organise the funeral.  Can you tell us about that ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> They were telling us after we have buried the corpses they would exhume it and put it in front of our house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> You say you did all of this on your own.  You don't mention your mother at all in, in your statement.  Can you, can you tell ... (tape ended)</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> My mother is staying at Vet Luigat and I'm staying  with my two siblings at, locally here and they are schooling at Mmabatho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> These people who you mentioned  as the people responsible, at least the people who were part of that group, do you ever, do you see them, do you interact with them ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> I don't go to that Luigat which means I've no way of meeting with them, so I haven't met them since.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Since that incident, since that night of 1994 you've never had contact with them again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> No, I didn't even meet one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Thank you very much  for coming to speak to us about something that is obviously very, very painful, to lose a parent is hard enough but to lose a parent under those circumstances with the horrific burning that you, that you describe and to witness something like that, so thank you, thank you very much for coming to speak to us.  I'll give you back to the Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MISS SEROKE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Professor Meiring.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Miss Lilian, thank you for coming and it must have been very difficult to tell your story.  I'll be very brief with my questions.  The one question is, after the horrible thing that happened to your family, did you or your younger brother and sister or your mother underwent any form of counselling ?  Did  people  treat  you  psychologically for what happened ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> No, we didn't, we didn't meet the psychologist Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Would you like that ?  Is that a need in the family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> Definitely, I say it is a need.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Thank you, I also see in your statement that you feel that there's no tombstone on your father's grave, is that correct ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> That's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> And then there's also the matter of the insurance policies that have not been paid out and you need help with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> That's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Thank you.  There's a last thing that I would just like to mention.  You say in your statement that you are prepared to meet with the perpetrators of this deed, it they are willing to meet with you and explain what happened., is that still the case ?  Are you still willing to meet with the perpetrators ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> Yes, I'm prepared to meet with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Lilian, just one question.  I heard you say that you've out of the village but your mother still lives in the village, now you said to Professor Meiring that you'd be willing to meet up with  the perpetrators.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> That's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After all these years, how do you actually feel about what happened ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">L KADI:</span> They de-stopped our lives, because we could have gone to school.  Now we don't have  somebody  responsible  who  can help us further our studies. I was, I couldn't have been working, I could have been at school now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Lilian.  Lilian, I'm sure it's - coming here and telling your story to-day, is extremely painful.  This happened  four or five years ago and I just want to echo what Dr Ally said, that this was a horrific killing almost at the time that we were about to move into a democratic South Africa as you've said in your statement yourself.  I hope that coming here to-day has helped in some way and that  the questions that Professor Meiring has asked you, that some help will be provided.  Thank you very much for coming.</p>
