We've been listening to witnesses that have been speaking about what happened in July 1990 and about Japhta and his role and his involvement.  This is an opportunity for you as a family member to give your account and your understanding of what happened.  Doctor Randera is going to assist you.  If at any time you feel that you want to have a break, please do so or if at any time you feel that you can't continue, please do so.  Try and be as relaxed as possible.  I'm going to ask you now if you will please just raise your right hand to take the oath.

Japhta came to me early in the morning and said to me, I should go and fetch my mother.  I went home to fetch my mother to take her to my house and he told me that he was going or a bucket system meeting and he said that I should attend to my mother because my mother was very sick.  After a few minutes while waiting for him to take our mother to the doctor I heard that my brother's house was burnt down and my brother was nowhere to be found.  I left for home to see this with my own eyes.  I was later told that he was caught while trying to run away and I was told that he is dead, next to the railway lines.  When I left my home one person said behind me, you must bring him alive, don't kill him.   I know the person's name but I will never say it now.  The same afternoon I said to my husband he should go to the police station to find out whether it was my brother Japhta who died and my husband and my brother's son said, please get into bed so that we can tell you the whole story.  They told me that he was unidentifiable, you couldn't even see his face.  We only identified him by his feet and the nose that it was Japhta.",

These incidents, these kind of incidents are always very, very difficult and it is really for the families, at the end of the day, who will have to decide how they will deal with this, how they will live with each other.  The role of the Truth Commission is not there to dictate to families.  It's to create the opportunity for people to come and speak, to see what kind of reconciliation there can be, to assist, to facilitate but that is ultimately a decision that you have to take with the other families.  What responsibility we do have as a Commission is to treat all incidents of Gross Human Rights Violations the same.  I think that is the thing which people often don't properly understand that we cannot make distinctions when it comes to Gross Human Rights Violations to the acts.  People who lose their lives, people who are tortured, people who suffered severe ill-treatment, people who would disappear as a result of the political conflict.  That is where the Truth Commission really has to be even-handed and where we have to listen to all sides of the conflict, to all accounts and to treat all of those accounts in the exact same manner.  We all have different political views.  That is inevitable.  We all have different views on what the nature of the struggle was about but there are many of us, many in the Commission who believe that the struggle which people fought to end oppression, to end apartheid was a correct struggle but when it comes to the violations that were committed as a result of that struggle, there as a Commission we have a duty to treat everybody the same and we hope that this opportunity which you have had to come and speak about what happened to your brother, the way he lost his life, notwithstanding how we may feel about the politics of that conflict but the opportunity that you have to come and speak about the gross violations which your brother suffered helps in some way.  We certainly hope that some means may be found for the families of all those who were caught up in this horrific event, that some means can be found for them to speak, to try and find some peace, to try and find some understanding.  Thank you again and when we make recommendations with regard to rehabilitation and  to reparations, that will be for all victims notwithstanding which side of the political conflict they were on.  It will be for all victims.  So, thank you very much to you and your daughter for coming to speak to us.   We will break for lunch and we will come back at half past two.",
