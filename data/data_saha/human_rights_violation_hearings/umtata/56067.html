<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will hand over to Reverend Xundu to call the next witness.  Now I would like to welcome officially Dr Makodo, a Commissioner from Natal, who has visited us today in this hearing in Umtata.  Dr Makodo we welcome you.  We are blessed by your presence with us.  We feel strengthened, encouraged, loved and affirmed that you have take the time to be with us.  Over to you Mcebisi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Commissioner, I would like to call Zola Twalo to the stand please.  With your permission, I would like to welcome you Zola.  The liberation that we have today, you have paid for it quiet dearly.  People have lost their loved ones in the different households.  Some lost their wives and, especially in this case, you have lost your brother.  He was also involved in the struggle for the liberation of our country and for our people, but he got ill treatment while they were in the custody of the police.  We thank you for coming forward so that you can tell the Commission and the country as a whole.  The main aim of the Commission is to when you tell your story so that the whole country must know that things like this should never happen again.  We must stop this disdainful thing that happened in the past,  the struggle for power.  These things must never happen again.  We thank you very much for coming to us and share to us what happened to your brother.  I am going now to ask you UMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE</p>

<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>to stand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">ZOLA TWALO:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, over to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tiny Maya will guide the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Mr Twalo Zola, according to the statement that we have here you are going to give evidence about the disappearance of your brother, Gwazo Twalo.  Could you please tell us who Gwazo Twalo was.  First tell us who you are and your home.  What kind of a home it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> My name is Zola Twalo.  I am a younger brother to Gwazo Twalo.  First I am going to thank the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for such a touching work that they are doing.  The last time I saw my brother, Gwazo, it was 1970 when he was going to Wentworth where he was going to start doing his medical studies.  The report that I heard was around June in 1972 while he was still at Wentworth.  He crossed the borders because he was trying to continue with the struggle for the liberation of our people.  In 1980 when I had visited Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza while he was arrested.  That is when I got the report that my brother had died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a> According to the report it seems like there was a conflict at Aliwal North and Herschel.  Apparently he was one of the people who was taken by the policemen and they put him in the Central Prison in Pretoria.  Now the authorities of the prison, they put him in the dongas and that was the end of him.  There were lots of rallys in Umtata because of the disappearance of people.  People who disappeared at their homes and their workplaces.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> There is something that I would like the Commission to do to help me out.  It is to investigate because it is </p>

<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>3 Z TWALO</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>obvious that is the responsibility of the Security Police of South Africa and the Transkei.  There is another honourable man, MEC Ezra Sigwela, who can also have an interest in the case.  He actually asked that he could be contacted so that he can try to help out with this case.  As we speak today we do not even know what happened to his bones.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Zola.  I would like us to go back a little.  In your statement you said Gwazo, he was a member of the student organisation called SASO.  How much do you know about his membership of the SASO organisation?  What kind of things that he use to do?  How did he contribute in the struggle especially as a member of SASO?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> As I have said the last time I saw him he was on his way to Wentworth, but now I could at I could see that he had SASO t-shirts and he use to distribute SASO t-shirts to people.  So I believe that he was an active member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Another thing you said, you have been told by Dumisa Ntsebeza that your brother has been disappeared.  Is this the Dumisa Ntsebeza here in front of you, one of the Commissioners that you are talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How did he tell you this because you said you were going to see a prisoner?  So, how did you see Dumisa Ntsebeza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> Dumisa Ntsebeza was one of my friends.  We use to meet quite a lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is he the prisoner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> Yes, he was the prisoner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Mr Twalo, at the time when you were talking to Mr Ntsebeza, when was the last time you heard about Gwazo and where was he at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>UMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>4 Z TWALO</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> According to my knowledge, which is not much, I realised that he has been based in Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is there any knowledge, you know of his transference back to South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> For him to be in a South African prison, it was because of the conflict that was in the Aliwal North area or Herschel which was where he was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did he give you any other details about the fact that he was in the prison?  Did he ever tell you anything else about this, except this conflict that was in Herschel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> No, nothing else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Were there any other means that you tried to make?  Maybe to contact the authorities of the jail just to find out what happened to him as a person who was now, who were you told that he is in jail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> No, I did not make any steps to try and find out except that I would like to take this opportunity to thank the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Could you please now tell us about your request as a family?  How can we help you out as the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> My request to the Truth Commission is to please investigate for me.  As I have said that Mr Ezra Sigwela has an interest in this case.  He would like to say something.  During the 1980's those people, the authorities who were there in the 1980's, they were the ones, they are the ones who can tell.  They are the ones who can tell us where are his bones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you have anything else, Mr Twalo, that you would like to say?  Perhaps just try to go back to your memory and think if there is anything else that you would like to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>UMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>5 Z TWALO</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> No, there is not anything else other than just finding the bones of my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Zola.  I am now going to hand you over to the Commissioner so that if there is anyone among my colleagues who wants to ask you a question, can do so.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Pumla Gobodo.  Thank you Zola.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO:</span> I remember very well Gwazo's story because we use to grow up together.  It was something that he use to make us wonder quite a lot.  Could you please tell us clearly so that we can have clarity about the details that you have mentioned.  You said before the first time you heard about the disappearance and the death of your brother was, you heard this from Dumisa Ntsebeza who was in jail at that time.  Could you please tell us more, why was Dumisa Ntsebeza arrested so that this can be recorded as well.  Why was he arrested?  That is now Dumisa Ntsebeza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> Mr Ntsebeza at around 1976.  He was also part of the struggle.  He was also trying to fight for the liberation of the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO:</span> In other words he was a political prisoner at the time when you visited him.  Thank you.  Last question.  The knowledge that he had about Gwazo, how did he get it?  How did Mr Ntsebeza know about Gwazo?  Could you please tell us more about that so that we can have clarity.  It could help us in our investigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> What I can is that when you are inmate, from where he was, which was now in Mount Fletcher, there was communication between him and us here in Umtata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOBODO:</span> Thank you Zola.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF PANEL:</span> So, in other words Mr Twalo, what you are</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>UMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>6 Z TWALO</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>really saying is that among the things that we can do for you is to find out from Mr Ntsebeza himself more details about how did he get this information about your brother.  Perhaps he can tell us more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF PANEL:</span> You also mentioned Mr Sigwela's name.  You also said that he also is interested in giving evidence about this case.  Now, in short, according to your knowledge do you know what he is going to talk about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> Even though I have not met him personally, Ezra Sigwela, he is one of our family members, but in my suspicion I know that he does have knowledge about what happened.  Knowledge from inside the prison.  I think he could have knowledge about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF PANEL:</span> Does Mr Sigwela know that you are going to talk about him today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR TWALO:</span> While I was in Bisho I did try to make contact so that I can speak to him, but his colleagues said, no, I cannot talk to him because he was very busy, but now I did submit his name to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in East London.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF PANEL:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Twalo, thank you very much for your story.  It is a rather painful story for losing your brother.  You have put it clearly in, quite briefly, but quite clearly.  Thank you very much, but when Mr Ezra Sigwela is giving his evidence later on today, I would please ask the respectable Commissioner to please include the fact that you have also mentioned this.  Alright, now so that the investigation unit had headed by the Dumisa Ntsebeza can be able to follow this up.  So that I can find out more about this case.</p>

<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>7 Z TWALO</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a> In fact, we are going to call Mr Sigwela so that he can be the first one after the break.  We are going to take a break now for ten minutes, ten to 15 minutes then we will return at 11 o' clock exactly.  </p>
