My mother who was raising him died, now after she died, at that time I was also working, though there were people who could raise him, I decided I am going to take him so that I can raise him, so I took him to Thawla to my sister, my elder sister who has now passed on Mrs Mtabisa. We all agreed on this, myself, Mrs Mtabisa and Mr Mtabisa so that for him to stay there and he did his Primary education at Twala  Village, he got his Matric at Mditchwe High. He completed his 1980 in December. From there he is registered at UNITRA in January 1981. It was now in this year the first month of this year, my sister passed on, Mrs Mtabisa, Batandwa grew up, he was still in UNITRA at the time, until he was appointed here at UNITRA as the member of the SRC. A year after that then he was suspended in UNITRA. After he was suspended he went back to Twala and then he was employed at Helca Trust, now it was at this time when he was working at the Helca Trust that he met his death.",

A white kombi arrived with dark tinted windows, Batandwa at the time was with his friend - Tubula Bam and the Security told him that they are coming here to him, when they took him so that they, to him they said they wanted to be shown around the town and they left with him. I don't know which route they took, but when they were going out of Twala going to Elliott, I don't know whether it was coming to Umtata or to Engwa but we call it Elliott Road. People saw this kombi, it passed the Police Station, Twala Police Station, now when he was going to town, Batandwa jumped out of the window and after that the Kombi stopped and Batandwa went to one of the houses, opposite the street. He was then followed by a shower of bullets. When he tried to open the door in this house, trying to go to the back at the same time but that didn't help him, apparently he was hit by one bullet which made him to lie on his stomach. Now two men arrived and a woman. The shots were still going on but he was already on the ground, while he was still trying to get up, but the bullets were still going on, at last one of the woman, this woman said \"Kill the dog, is this dog still alive, finish him off\". At the time one of the woman who was inside the house, listening to all this chaos and this noise she went out. She wanted to see what was going on, now but these people left my son. Now the woman from inside the house asked \"whose son is this you want to kill in my house\", so when she said that, they turned back and they took him back into the Kombi and they left with him. They took him to the Police Station, from there they took him to the hospital again. Now but unfortunately when they got to hospital the Doctor couldn't do anything because he was already dead.",

Partly, it's important for the Commissioner to begin to have a clear understanding of the people whose lives were at risk in the past. Can you maybe tell us as to the kinds of things that you know your son to have been involved with which lead to his expulsion and then later on to his detention?",

            "Mama, thank you very much for the report that you have put forward to the Commissioner today. As Reverend Xundu has said when he was welcoming you here, this will never leave our minds. The picture of that day, the day your son fell, the day your son was killed, so painfully, so brutally just like the policeman has said, according to your testament that your son was killed like a dog. I think at the time it was very difficult here in the Transkei, there were very few people that could stand for the truth. Many people here in the Transkei, they were in a position where that they had no hope, but Batandwa, you son became a bright light in the darkness. We are going to try by all means to investigate as the Commission, we will try to contact the people who you have mentioned, the people who have made the statements, especially to try to find out who exactly is responsible for the killing of Batandwa. We will try by all means so that we can get exactly why was Batandwa expelled from the University of the Transkei.\n We will also try and find from the authority at the time to try and find out what really happened because the role played by the University trying to look down upon the people, the young people who used to fight for freedom but being excluded for fighting for our freedom not on academic grounds that is something we are going to find out more even the principals are going to get in touch with them and find out why these things happen to the students. We salute you, Mama, as his mother we thank you as well that in your womb a hero like this one can come out. \n We assure you as a Commission, that when we write our Commission, the last report that is going to our President we assure you that Batandwa's name will be one of those. In all the details that we will get from the investigations will be included. Thank you very much.",
