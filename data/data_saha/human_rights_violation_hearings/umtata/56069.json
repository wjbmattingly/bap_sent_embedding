            "I am Tombisonkie Miss Xatula and I was married to the Honono family.  Out of my nine children Leo was my\nUMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE\n2 N XATULA\nfirst born.  He was brought up here at Umtata by his aunt and he also attended school here in Umtata.  He passed standard ten in St Johns College.  \n Leo use to disappear and we would not know his whereabouts, but I heard rumours because I had some information that he was involved in some activities.  In 1981 Leo disappeared permanently and we learned that he was in Cape Town, but nobody ever specified where exactly was he.  In 1982 my sister came to report that Leo is nowhere to be found.  I heard rumours from one of the gentlemen who use to talk about him, it was Pandile Gisan.  I came here in Umtata and I tried to locate this gentlemen.  Fortunately I saw him when he was just following me because he saw me also.  We talked and discussed and I wanted to know what was going on.  He use to say young aunt when he addressed me and then he said I would go again.  I am here, but I am now employed.  I will come back again after a long time.  I will be working at sea.  Again, I realised that Leo was thinking of doing something. I said to him please communicate even if you go wherever you go, please maintain contact.  He disappeared. \n In 1983 he went to attend one of the ceremonies which was an initiation ceremony of the other boys in the community and that was the last time when he bade farewell to me.  My sister said the police use to visit him.  They usually wanted to know whether they know where Leo is.  I was surprised, but I did not take much consideration of all what was happening.  I did not inform them of what was happening, even my family.  In 1988 June one girl Nokuku called me on my way from school.  I was a teacher at the time.  I was teaching at Qumbu.  This girl, I knew her to be\nUMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE\n3 N XATULA\nImpisana, but during the reign of Matanzima most of the children would change their surnames and would go and pretend to be related to the Matanzimas.  I was surprised because Nokuku also said she was Matanzima.  Nobody knew that she was Impisana family.  Many youth were always communicating with this girl and she use pretend as if she has befriended them.  I met this girl again and she asked me when did last see Leo.  I said I last saw him quite a while ago.  ... west coast and at Bizana.  This girl said please hide his photographs and just tell them that all the relatives that have the photos should hide them because he is wanted.  This perturbed me for quite a long time.  \n We learnt that there were people who were terrorists.  We all knew that the people who use to cross the borders were labelled as terrorists.  I was also having the impression that Leo might be amongst those people who were alleged to be terrorists.  In June at the same time I met Nomabuta who is my sister.  She was with Mrs Gonie who is Ms Makippie is also, is a teacher here in Umtata.  They came to Qumbu where I was staying.  I could assess that they have brought bad news and I asked them because I was not familiar with them.  I did not always have visits from them.  So at the end they said we must come and tell you what happened.  They said there is a young man who is killed.  There is a policeman who is Boy and this policeman claimed that it was Leo who was killed.  He had to be identified.  The first question I asked why did they come to you.  She said I do not know.  I asked did you come to report officially or did she just come because she was in Kanduli because my sister was married there.  She said I am not quite certain that this was an official report.  It was said there was an\nUMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE\n4 N XATULA\nunrest in Bizana and then he died there.  I did not know what to do and then during that period the people were collected.  \n When I looked outside I could see that there was one gentlemen in one of the cars.  It was a white Skyline and I said I must try to find out much from this lady.  I did not believe that Leo is dead.  I asked whose car is this?  He said, no, Boy gave this to us.  Who is driving?  It is Blackcat Nombanga.  He was a policeman in the Security Department.  They told me the day when we were supposed to go and identify Leo.  My sister and Ms Makippie left my place and I asked the people to be with me for quite a while because I wanted to make some telephone calls.  I did not even know to whom should I report this.  I did not know with whom should I communicate and I knew that the minute you have people who are labelled as terrorists you were also regarded as a dog.  I thought for a while and I thought of this Dumisa Ntsebeza.  I have never met him, but I just learnt that this Dumisa was also being arrested.  I knew that he was a lawyer.  I just wanted to know how could I meet him.  I took the directory and looked up his telephone number.  Fortunately I could get the telephone number, it was a bit late.  I phoned him at phone and then I was asked who I was.  I identified myself and then I was given information that I should wait for seven minutes.  A few minutes thereafter I phoned again.  He answered the telephone.  He wanted to know more about me and then we communicated telephonically.  He asked me did I know the office where they were working.  I said no.  He even asked do you know me personally.  I explained that I never met you.  He said, no, you cannot communicate everything \nUMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE\n5 N XATULA\ntelephonically.  I just mentioned that there is this nephew of mine who is now late.  \n Very early in the morning I went to the office.  I waited for him, this Ntsebeza.  One young gentlemen came in.  He was dressed in a denim.  I did not even recognise that it could be Dumisa Ntsebeza and then I asked him from the others and then I was informed that it was this lawyer that I wanted him.  Then we discussed and then at the end I said I would go and identify Leo.  We found this Blackcat.  One of his friends, the friend to Leo was also a runaway because he was wanted by the police.",

I was surprised to listen to the songs which are, which were\nUMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE\n6 N XATULA\ntaped and were in the recorder.  I did not associate these songs with the Security Officer because as there was a one piece which was born to suffer.  This hurt me a lot.  I really could not associate the police officers with these types of songs because they were freedom songs.  \n We reached the destination at Bizana at the security and we did not go where Leo was.  We were forced to go to the Security Officer.  Blackcat informed us that that is where we are going to know where Leo was.  Before we reached Bizana I asked who killed Leo and how was he killed?  This gentleman said to me there was a coincidence.  He was got by a stray bullet otherwise the bullet was not directed to him.

We reached our destination and then the police who were in the offices came out.  There were two Boers.  They were always amongst the other policemen.  I asked Blackcat who could be responsible for the death of my nephew.  He said I was present, but it was not me.  Just accept what I am saying to you that a stray bullet just hit him.  The policemen that we were together with are those who are at Bizana.  I asked him who was the other one who was there?  He said Damasa was one of them.  He took me to Dumisa.  I asked Ndabisa what happened.  He repeated the same story and UMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE\n7 N XATULA\nsaid it was a coincidence.

            "We went to the hospital in the mortuary.  When I got there I was allowed to get inside and I found another policeman who was called Gilile.  I think he was the Station Commander.  When I got in the mortuary I could see a person in the corner, but he was covered with a sheet.  I could see that this one was shot and you could see that he was a bit stout.  His feet were out, but you could see that his feet were very shot.  I was ordered that I should go and identify that one.  When I looked, before I could even look him on the face I could see that his feet were not belonging to Leo and then I was ordered to go out if I said it was not him.\n When I went out Blackcat approached me.  He said please you must not cry.  I am appealing to you, please, just ask very properly and try to get as much information as possible.  Try to identify, please do not cry because we will not be able to identify him very well.  After some time I was given an opportunity to get inside.  There were two other bodies.  The second body was also covered with the \nUMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE\n8 N XATULA\nsheet, but I could see the feet were also exposed.  When I looked through, I just looked through and I could see and identify Leo with his feet.  Then I said the feet belong to him, but I was going to look and identify him.  Then I tried top identify.  When I looked his hands I could see that the rigour was setting in.  When I looked at the hands and the feet I could see that they really belonged to him.  I started to uncover him and I could see that one eye was open and his mouth was also open.  It was really Leo.  The only difference was that he had no moustache before he left our place, but now he had beard and a moustache, but I could identify him and see that it was Leo.  \n When I was looking at him I could only see one scar which was on the forehead.  I wanted to know what was the cause, what hit him on the forehead.  You could see that there was a depression here and you could see that he was cleaned already and there was a plaster which was covering the wound.  Nobody answered me.  I looked the throat and I could see that he appeared to have been hung.  It seemed as if he was, he had hanged.  You could see scars and visible marks on the throat and I received no response and nobody cared to reply me.  When I looked at the arms I could see that, you could see that there were fractures.  You could see black scars on the arms especially the upper arms.  Each time I wanted to know what caused these and nobody ever responded to me and then I was very angry.  I removed the cover and threw it aside.  When I looked at the eye on the, in the nipple on the left side you could see that something was oozing and then I turned him over, but you could see that there was a very small hole.  I asked them did you use any sharp instrument to pierce him or was he stabbed and \nUMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE\n9 N XATULA\nnobody answered me.  I looked at the ankles and you could see that he was fastened.  There were scars.  The other leg seemed to have fractured.  The first thing I prayed, but I can just say I insulted them severely, I used the most abrasive language that I could think of.  I could see that they were frightened because I was not closing my eyes.  I was just insulting them and talking about the atrocities that they were inflicting on people.  One policeman Gilile answered and said he was shot.  I asked him who shot him and he said I do not know.  I just saw the body here.  I asked him why do you come and inform me that he has been shot and then you say you do not know.  He did not give me an accurate answer.  At the end I went out.  \n I would like to mention and say there are many, there are two compartments in this section.  On the other section I could see many bodies, they were covered.  If I could count I think there were about six or seven.  There were not less than six, but they were not above seven.",

            "I was given restricted orders.  I was given orders when to bury my niece and it was Saturday, Sunday, Monday and I was informed that I should choose one of the days.  The Tuesday, between Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  There were orders that by two o' clock everybody should have dispersed by that time.  They also stipulated the number of the people who were supposed to attend the funeral.  They said it should be about 200.  Then I was surprised because I was asking myself am I going to send invitations now to the people so that I can say who should attend the funeral or who should not.  We therefore took the body to Dalisas at, after the post mortem.\n On that day, it was on a Thursday, probably I might be mistaken.  I could say it would appear as if we were burying the high ranking official of the police because the funeral was surrounded by the police.  All over the place, over the river at Sika, the police, the soldiers, everybody was turned back because I had prepared the funeral arrangements for Showvery.  The coffin was being searched.  They said they were looking for grenades.  I was surprised and I was asking myself could we really do that to carry the grenade \nUMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE\n13 N XATULA\nin the coffin of our child.  Blackcat has turned now.  He was just like a puffadder.  He was not advising us anymore.  He looked to have turned against us.  We went to Showvery and then we could see that there were many police.  They were trying to do everything in their control.  They were taking photos, they were doing everything that was not acceptable according to our culture.  \n Unfortunately, there were Comrades.  The others who were in the struggle, the colleagues to Leo, there were others who were from abroad, those who were coming from Johannesburg they were turned back some of them.  I can mention that everybody experienced a horrible experience because people were being assaulted, shamboks were used.  Mulowa was carrying a knopkirrie and was dispersing everybody.  People were assaulted, wires, rifle butts were used to assault people.  I was also taken out of the people, I was removed from the crowd and then they were ridiculing me.  The most painful experience was to watch my children being assaulted.  I can mention that nobody could throw any soil in the grave.  There was only one child who managed to run away.  \n There was also an order that I should be arrested.  When I was taken to the van so that I can be detained Mulowa came to defend me.  He asked who is going to bury Leo if you are going to take his aunt away and then they succumbed and then they handed me over to my family.  I continued with the coffin, with the burial.  The Reverend could not continue with the sermon because there was a lot of disturbance from the police and the South African Defence Force.  When we were still busy with the funeral the people were assaulted again.  I did not run away because I was very angry.  I \nUMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE\n14 N XATULA\nstarted to insult them again, but at the end I went up and then we went back to my place.  \n I can mention the people who were assaulted.  Songabile Manotwa, he is now a Minister of Parliament.  I am sure that he still bears the scars of the assault.  Pindile, Lwasie Mashlaka.  One gentlemen from the Zibi family he died and then my children.  There were many threats.  I can just mention that the coffin was not covered with soil.  It was just put in the grave and it was difficult to put the soil over.  I discovered that during the time of the funeral the coffin fell.  Yes, it is so.  The police just hit the coffin and it fell.  The corpse fell.",
