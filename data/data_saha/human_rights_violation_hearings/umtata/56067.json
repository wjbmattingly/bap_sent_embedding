He was also involved in the struggle for the liberation of our country and for our people, but he got ill treatment while they were in the custody of the police.  We thank you for coming forward so that you can tell the Commission and the country as a whole.  The main aim of the Commission is to when you tell your story so that the whole country must know that things like this should never happen again.

The last time I saw my brother, Gwazo, it was 1970 when he was going to Wentworth where he was going to start doing his medical studies.  The report that I heard was around June in 1972 while he was still at Wentworth.  He crossed the borders because he was trying to continue with the struggle for the liberation of our people.  In 1980 when I had visited Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza while he was arrested.  That is when I got the report that my brother had died.\n According to the report it seems like there was a conflict at Aliwal North and Herschel.  Apparently he was one of the people who was taken by the policemen and they put him in the Central Prison in Pretoria.  Now the authorities of the prison, they put him in the dongas and that was the end of him.  There were lots of rallys in Umtata because of the disappearance of people.  People who disappeared at their homes and their workplaces.  \n There is something that I would like the Commission to do to help me out.  It is to investigate because it is \nUMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE\n3 Z TWALO\nobvious that is the responsibility of the Security Police of South Africa and the Transkei.  There is another honourable man, MEC Ezra Sigwela, who can also have an interest in the case.  He actually asked that he could be contacted so that he can try to help out with this case.  As we speak today we do not even know what happened to his bones.",
