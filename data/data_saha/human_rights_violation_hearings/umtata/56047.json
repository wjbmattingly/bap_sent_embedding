            "... approaching in a very high speed.\nWe did not know what was happening.  The car stopped in front of our house.  I got out and I asked what is happening.  I asked, this person did not say anything. He just came inside and he took a knopkirrie.  Then I followed.  I followed trying to follow him the same way that he left.  Some men from the village heard that there were shots and apparently it was my husband who was being shot.  One of the elderly men from the village stopped him and so he did stop and young men who covered their face with balaclavas shot at him, but they did not shoot, they did not hit him, they shot at the car.  Let me tell you now what happened again.  \n Before he went back home the car was already hit though he was not injured at the time and now again in 1992 he went to town.  He was going to buy some stock for his father's shop.  On his way from the town he passed my place.  He left some of the things at home.  He was with another girl.  At home there was my mother.  On his way to Showvery he did not realise there was another car that was following him.  He wondered why is this car that has been following me, this car does not even have a number plate.  He kept on wondering about this.  Then when they were not far from where they \nUMTATA HEARING EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE\n2 F N LADLOKOVA\nwere going to he heard some shots, but unfortunately they were not hitting at him.  Then they got the wheel of the car.  He then got out of the car.  They did not give him a chance even then.  Then he ran and he hid himself in this house.  They tried to search for him even in the house and then he tried to escape through the window.  While he was still trying to escape he fell into a hole, into a ditch.  They got him out of there.  There were shots being fired this whole time and then he asked, please man, forgive me, what have I done, but that was the time that they took him.  They had no forgiveness in their hearts.",
