I used to say to him no, I don't know what you are talking about.  \n The worst part of it, I didn't even see this letter, so how can I even say anything without even seeing the letter. So they said I have to take off my shoes and my socks.  They took some rocks and they put the rocks inside my shoes, and then I was told to do a frog-jump.  I continued with this frog-jump.

We went on struggling for a long time.\n It was this Warrant Officer Heunis, he kicked me on my mouth and while he was doing this, while he was trying to do it again, then I fought back. I slapped him on his face. I \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n4 WITNESS\ntried to get hold of the revolver.  I could also see that it was already cocked. Then I grabbed it and I threw it away. Then I said exactly what you want to do to me here is to kill me, but I thought what I am going to do now is to take care of myself here.    They were pushing me forward and backwards.  It was such a (indistinct) Revel that helped me out.  He tried now to stop this whole thing. Then he said no, stop, he is going to tell the truth. He tried to calm them down.  \n Sgt Kromhout left and I was again interrogated.  They told me according to the investigations, it is this typewriter that was used to write this letter.
