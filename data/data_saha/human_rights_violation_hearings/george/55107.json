            "While I was detained in 1986, it was on Sunday the date was the 15th - when we arrived at the detectives office in Town, there were twenty of us.  These policemen who arrested us they had guns, the long guns, they pulled the trigger and we thought they were going to shoot us, we didn't know that the trigger was not on.\n After they put us, they beat me with their hand gun at the back of my head, they put me in the dog cell, I think there were nine of us.  When I gained consciousness we were in George, they told us that we are going to be there for 14 days and then after that we would be released.  \n After 14 days we asked when are we going home - they couldn't answer us and it was a difficult time as from them we didn't eat.  After three weeks the boers Maritz, Bosman and an old man known as Uncle or  [indistinct] they took us to the detectives, it was me and Lelele Mbangi, Lelele was taken to a separate office, they asked me whether do I know Nkosinathi Lengisi, I said no I don't know that person.  I knew that was my father, he was one of the activist, they told me that you know Nkosinathi Lengisi, he is your father.  If you deny this, that will cause you a trouble we will beat you, that was Maritz who said that.  Uncle was a translator.  \n I denied all these things and they beat me up, clapped me, they kicked me and I denied all the time they forced me - there was a drawer - they put my penis and my testicles into a drawer, it was the first time I  experienced a pain of my private parts.  I went unconscious, I woke - until I woke up in the cell.\n After a month there was a policeman, they take our clothes -  [indistinct] there naked, each day on the 30th of each month, we were taken - lived naked, when I asked them to go to the hospital, they told me that my hospital will be a cell, up and until I tell them that I know my father.  I told this guy who was a translator that you  know my father - you know my father who is - I am selling the fish, so they couldn't care about that, they just take off our clothes and leave us naked  up until the time they had to release us.\n They didn't want to release me, I just help - I promised them that I am going to commit suicide if they don't release me, because I was tired of being tortured.  They take us to Mossel Bay and they tell us many things and then after that we had to be released. \n Now when I go back to school, I was not clear and I failed my Std 5 and after that I decided to leave school.  I couldn't go and lay a charge because there was nothing that was going to be further, I saw again this boer after the death of Chris Hani.  Ms Bosman again take me again to\nthis office, truly this time I was not involved and now they press my testicles against that drawer, that showed hatred against me.  \n I went and laid the charge - give them the statement that's why I am here today, and that was all.",
