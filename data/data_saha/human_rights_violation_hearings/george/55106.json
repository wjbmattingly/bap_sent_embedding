            "On 7 - 1986 it was about 5am - I was at home in JCC's Camp Location.  I was still in bed then, I heard a knock on the door, I didn't hear a sign of a car or what - a sound or something - the knock insisted and my father went to open the door.  When he opened the door, it was Captain Neil Calitz on the door, Sergeant Maritz was with him and Sergeant October.\n They asked my father if - does he have a young man or son - he tried to deny but they searched the house and they found me and shot, they grabbed me and put me in a hurry to put on my clothes - I clothes myself after I finished, they said they are taking me, I asked them where are we off to, and they said you have no right to ask any question, just hurry up and get your clothes on.\n After I finished clothing myself we went on.  We drive in a white Opel Record, Captain Calitz was the driver,  they drove to Da Gamaskop police station, that is a police station near the JCC's Camp Location.  When we arrived there,  they take me into a office by now detectives of Da Gamaskop are waiting there.\n On the way to Da Gamaskop I  have noticed that many policeman have surrounded the location.  While we were there in the police station they said I must tell only the truth and tell them who burnt down the busses of police - Port Elizabeth and who also assaulted and tortured the driver.\n I told them I know nothing about that, they started there to torture me.  He was the one, Captain Calitz who started to beat me - to kick me by his police boot.  The way he kicked me it was not likely, I fell down, I tried to stand up again and I  asked him what did I do, he said he doesn't take any argument with a kaffir communist.  I was still as shocked and amazed and the two captains also come they beat me up, mercilessly - they were kicking me with their big boots, saying I am one of the leaders in JCC Kamp, I am also one of the rivals and the one to help with deformation of the organisations like United Democratic Front.  \n I tried to deny it, but seemingly I was making them to beat me more, after that they left me.  But there was a sound - I heard that there was sound of people because it was noisy and people were singing.  After they have left me,  October came back and Captain Calitz, Maritz was also with them.  The tortured me again.\n After that they left me there, they said I am going to sleep there, they will leave me there for a while.  I slept  there for three days, on the 3rd day early in the morning, Maritz came, he was with October, they were there to fetch me - taking me to Mossel Bay police station.  When we arrived at that police station, that's where the exact torture started, accusing me of burning down the Port Elizabeth bus and I am the leader of the communist in the JCC camp.  \n I denied that of - I denied everything they were accusing me of, they took my penis, they take me closer to a table that had a drawer on top of that table there was a file, it was written Captain Neil Calitz.  They shifte my - the drawer with my penis inside and they put it - the drawer, they closed the drawer.  I had to cry and I cried and I said baas I'll tell the truth.\n After they released me, I denied, I tried to deny the accusations again and Captain Calitz says you'll know me today, as from today onwards, I will take the roots of the commmunist out of your mind.  They tried to torture me, they were beating me by the batons.  It was was Maritz and October, Captain Calitz came behind my  back and he beat me with the back of his gun on my  head.  If I can turn my head you will see the mark is still on my head the scar,  I bled and I was dizzy, I fell down.\n Even so I asked him what was he exactly doing - can he answer in the Court of Law if I can lay a charge against him.  What he was show off the  [indistinct] told me, he want to make and down with a kaffir and he pointed at me with a gun after he hit me badly.\n What I was waiting for him is to let my brains off with that gun, he tortured me enough and he let me stayed in the Mossel Bay police station.  I asked him to take me to the hospital, and he said a communist can't get treatment, they only thing he usually do - did is to bring me a Panado and something that had a red colour to put  on my scar.\n When he sees that there was nothing that have beaten - showed that they have beaten me, although my penis have bled a little while, hopefully this pills were helping me.\n After that, seeing that I am getting better, Sergeant Maritz again start opening a docket for me saying that I tortured a PE bus driver.   After that he take me to Mossel Bay prision.  After opening the document,  I stayed there in the Mossel Bay prison without any bail, they couldn't grant me any bail.  I was from the cells to the Court and then back to the cells again for six months that was happening to me.\n I also heard Comrades who were also with me, but they were arrested after me.  They were in a place called  [indistinct] it's a place in a court where the jail people were use to be kept the prisioners were used to be kept when they are going to stand against.  He said your co-accused are also in this matter that you did, I told him that I know nothing about what you are telling me.  You know - you the torturers.  And I asked my co-accused is it really the same thing that you are accused of and they said yes.  But they also said they know nothing about it.\n I was going - I was attending the Court cases, they were swearing at me, it was Sergeant Maritz, he was saying words about my mother, rude words, whom I  can't even say in front of the Commission, that's why my heart is so broken.\n Because Maritz said to me - we arrived late at your place, we were suppose to be there earlier than the time we arrived so that we can take you next to  [indistinct] and killed you there, because you are the one who's given the influence to the other, you in JCC Camp.  Amongst my colleagues one of - I can point is not here Richard Ndou is one of them, he was my co-accused but I met him after I was tortured.  The case took about six months and they said, they found me not guilty because we had lawyers  [indistinct] for us.\n Fortunately I was released from those perpetrators.",
