I still remember it was in 1985, five of then were arrested and they were - they stayed in jail for 25 days.  I went to ask then why did they arrest the children.  They said to me we will let them free on a certain date and I went back to work.  When I came back from work that day, my child was at home and I didn't say anything.  \n On the 6th of May - on the 5th of May in that year they were at  [indistinct]  and they were arrested.  The next morning I went to see them, he was badly assaulted.  And I couldn't realise he was my child and I went back home.  They stayed in the cells for 8 months and their - on the other side their court hearing was continuing.  There were 5 - it continued until December and on the 19th it went to the Supreme Court and it - they were discharged.  And they managed to come back home and they carried on with their schooling.  \n While schooling I didn't have sleep at all because the police would come home - I didn't know where was sleeping because he didn't sleep at home.  But when I prepared myself for work he would come and prepare himself for school.  I didn't know what was happening because he wasn't fond of lingering around the streets.  He was a church-goer  - he used to be at the church and he belonged to the Christian Youth Organisations.  Some - some - some of the people didn't like what our children were doing.  \n And as time went on he said to me I want to leave this place - I'm going to - to seek another place where I can go to school.  I said to him go Lathli, and then he left.  Months went by not knowing where my child was, I was very un restless.  Terror  [indistinct]  I couldn't rest and every time they come to me I would give them answers and I would say to them you started with my child, what did you want from him.  \n Things were like that - years went by and they came to me at work and they questioned me about things that I do not understand.  While interrogating me I kept on saying I don't know what you are asking.  And - and he said I should sign a form, I said to him I don't to sign this because I don't know what am I signing.  And my employer said give me those papers so that I can read then and after that I signed.  I knocked of and I went home - a year went by I didn't see my child.  He left in 1985.",

            "I think my son disappeared for a year and 7 months and I saw him on the 8th month.  I saw him only one day - just one day.  It was that night when he came to me and I was so happy to see him - he was so handsome.  But I had troubles within me - I didn't know whether this child will live for me and I didn't know what was God's plan with my son.  \n Those who were after him were so many, and I only gave then to God - I said God help me.  You know I used to pray because I was like a Samaritan woman.  And the next day - it was a Friday and we were told he was dead.  It was about 3 o'clock in the morning when I went outside - I couldn't sleep.  All lights were off and I asked myself I didn't know what was happening.  I said who's child is being killed at this moment, I was alone outside asking myself this question.  I was troubled and I started suspecting something.  God was telling me - God was sending me a message that this thing is happening for you.  I  [indistinct] - I  [indistinct] down at my door and I prayed.\n When I arrived at work the boers interrogated me - they asked me, they said Mary what was - what's happening.  I said no I don't know anything, I said to them maybe you might know what's happening - I don't.  But in my heart, in my soul I knew exactly what happened because my ancestors told me and that was the truth.  I went to work as a person who don't have any information and after work I went home and two women came to my house.\n While I was just about to get into my house they were coming just after me and I asked myself what do these women want.  Again there was an indication - I found out that my furniture was taken out of my house without my consultation.  I went into my bedroom and I spoke to my ancestors.  I said - I said I don't know whether - had he been killed or had he been arrested.  My sister in law came to me and she said to me  You must know that you've lost your son.  I said to her  Sister my ancestors told me before hand about this incident.\n This was my son that I trusted, he was at St Bonavess School doing Std 9.  I hope that I've told you what I wanted to tell you.  The comrades came to assist me - even if they ran away at times, not staying with me for quite a long time but they came to help.  I stayed like that and the police van was parked at my gate at night and my son was at the mortuary.  I said to the children in the house  lets go to sleep, we'll see what tomorrow brings.\n The next morning I went to church to consult with the Ministers.  I was together with my brother and my sister - my sister in law's child.  And they took my to Transvaal Road Police Station.  When I entered there I saw a man and I asked myself, I said  God is this not the man who killed my son.   And the Minister assisted me because I couldn't stand any more.  They greeted us and we sat down, the Minister was talking to them and he said to them  We are here because of a certain case, and they gave us an answer.  They said to us - they said  Can you please come and see us on Monday because we are closed today, and then we left the place.  We went back to our homes, we went to Ipopeng.  I remember the Minister asked me whether do I know the place where my child was killed.  I said  Yes, I've been told.   We went to Ipopeng - at Ipopeng the place was full of blood but the Minister prayed and he used water at that house.  I then talked with the owner of the house and he asked her where the children were and she told the - the Minister where the children were.\n Everything was up side down,  Terra came while we were there.  I looked at him twice, three times and I couldn't look at him any more.  And I heard as if someone was saying to me Terra killed your son.  And I was - I was certain that it was Terra who killed my son.  And he - he came into the house and he wanted Misty Mabozo's clothes and the sister took the clothes and she gave them to him.",

In 1987 our grandmother came and said Lathli is now back.  The - my mother went to Ipopeng together with her, on the day of his arrival I also went to see him and said to me we don't have to tell any body that he is back because his life would be in danger.  \n And he told me the second thing and he said I should bring him his girlfriend.  I said to him Lathli  You said to me nobody should know that you are back.  And I said to him  Why do you want me to bring your girlfriend, and he said  No I want to see her before I leave.  I went to fetch Dumy and I took her to my grandmother's house.  Well, they talked - that was in the week he was supposed to leave.  On the day of his departure he was together with his girlfriend Dumy.  I asked him   Luthli why did you come, what are you doing here, and he said  No I'm - I wanted to bring the message home.  I have to tell Manidi Pitsho a certain message, I have to meet him before I leave.\n Dumy also asked him what brought him back and he only said to Dumy Love brought me back, I love you.  On that Friday when we heard that he had been killed my mamma was at work and I was at school.  We didn't know what happened.  My mamma normally wakes up very early in the morning and when she went out of the house all the lights were off.  That was the time when my brother was killed.  On that - on that Friday when we came back home the house was full of people and I asked  What was happening, and they said no my brother had been killed.\n My mamma was not at - at home that time but when she arrived she discovered that her furniture and her belongings were removed out of the house.  The police were harassing us before we could bury Luthli and they told us not be bury Luthli on a weekend - it should be during the week.  They wanted us to do everything according to their orders.  We buried him on the 2nd of September 1987.  The body was not at home yet, the police arrived.  The police were around - they came to us at the church and they instructed us how the ceremony should be conducted.  At the grave yard we were standing there and they said they're only giving us 5 minutes and everything should be done within 5 minutes.\n After the coffin was put into the grave they said they're giving us 3 minutes to disperse.  When people were busy putting soil into the grave they started shooting.  At home food had been prepared for the people who were at the funeral, while people were busy eating the police came in.  They said they don't want anybody around, they went straight to the women who prepared the food and started tear gassing them.  \n Many people didn't eat on that day, food was just destroyed - it was hot, we had to - we had to dig up holes so that we can throw the food inside and they continually came to us, asking us Lathli's whereabouts.
