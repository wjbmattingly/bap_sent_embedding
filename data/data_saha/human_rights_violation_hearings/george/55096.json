            "I thank you - in 1996 - in 1986 it was June - it was June in 1986 on the 26th - I was staying with my aunt - what happened in the evening I am not sure it's either in the evening or  morning around about twelve to one on this day of the 26th  policeman came - they surrounded the house.  Some of them were knocking on the windows, some were knocking on the door.  What happened is this, my aunts husband woke up, he woke up and opened the door.  As soon as he opened the door, the policeman ran inside the house they were asking for Joseph and he said I am Joseph.\n They came inside the house and they approached me.  They looked at me and they said I must come along with my uncle.  When we got to the police station what they did they took the tyres and put them around us, they said they were going to burn us down, because that's what we did.\n We didn't say anything not a word, we were just amazed because we don't know what the policeman were doing.  They were just moving up and down in the  minute, someone came in that was a comrade - he was handcuffed - they were about to say they are releasing us.  They were saying no this is not the people we are looking for.  \n When about to go to the door, one comrade came in, his name is Citi Bunga - what happened they asked him a question if he can  - does  he know us and he said yes I do know this people and they asked him who are their names.  Citi Bunga first looked at us -  they asked him whether - does he know my uncle and he said yes and asked him, his name and he say no I am sorry  - I  don't know his name.  They asked him my name and he said this is Joseph.  The policeman looked at each other and they said to him no this is no Joseph, Joseph is the other one.  \n They take me and said they were looking for me and he said yes this is Jeff.  We were just about to go out - policeman took me.  As from them they took me inside and locked me in, after then I don't know whether they took my uncle home or what happened to him and then the following day the policeman came to the cells where they locked me in.\n They took me into one of their offices, when we were inside, they beat me like anything.  They took their guns and beat me up, they were standing in corners surrounding me, they sat me behind the table, one was in front of me, sitting just in front of  me - they asked me about the incidents that happened in George.  He asked me the things that I am doing in George, what am I exactly doing there.   Why do I allow everything to happen here, because they heard that I am the one who is the cause of this.\n When I told them that I don't know what they are talking about, they took the table and pushed me with the table and I knocked my head against the wall.  They pushed me against the wall with the table - after that they pulled the table.  They said I must come closer to them - just because I was afraid and I couldn't come closer because I hit myself against the wall.  Now if you take me, if you said I must come closer again,  you will then pull me against -  push me against the wall again.  \n They took me and take me back to the table again.  They asked me questions.  I told them that I couldn't answer anything because I know nothing and where you find me is at home.  And they said to me that if you are saying that, we have to hit you until you tell us the truth, they started beating me up.  They were pulling me down, kicking me - jumping over myself - some were pointing down at me - they tell  - they put a coin down and they said I must ran around that coin, if I don't do that, they will kill me.\n That thing happened and the day was over, they were beating me, later that day again they came and handcuffed me, they locked me inside again.  Where I was - the way people were asking questions, why are you the only one who is being beaten, my question was I don't know.  I sat there and then the following day the policeman came and fetched me.  They took me to one of the offices in York Street, that is the charge office on the third floor.\n When I came in there, they put me in one of those offices, they beat me there again.  They tied my hands, put me on top of the chairs, they tied my hands together with my feet.  They took a plastic and put it on my head -  they took another object that I  couldn't identify and put it on top of the plastic and they  covered my head and they pulled me, so I don't know where I was.\n After that some people came in I don't know who were they, they were beating me, each and everyone was coming.  Each and everyone who is coming in there, they were asking is this the one and they said yes and then they beat up.  That took the whole day.\n My people what was happening there was very difficult and it was painful the blood was just flowing.  After they finished that, they take off what was on my  head, after that they untied me from the chair.  They said I must wipe myself.  After they told me, I just told them no  I can't because my body was so painful, can you please wipe me.  They looked at each other.\n One of them come and wipe me and he also wiped the floor.  And old man came in and he said to them, what you guys are doing is very wrong.  They just looked at each other in silence, after that they beat me up again, my hands was still tied - were tied up.  They were kicking me - jumping over me - and they take me back to the cell again.  When I came into the cell - these guys were with me, ask me why are you being beaten so much and I told them that I don't know the reason of this thing - of the situation, maybe there is someone amongst us who said that I did something wrong or maybe because I  was  the member of the freedom struggle, that's why I am being beaten.\n This thing of being beaten took each and everyday while I  was there, I can't remember how long was I there.  I remember one day they took me to that  [indistinct] again and while we were there, they took me with my right arm, put me on the table, they hang me.  After that they kicked what was under my feet, I  was just stayed there hanging.  After hanging there for a while - they said to me we are going to - we are going to leave here and please tell us when you are going to say the truth and I told them the truth I am saying is what I am telling you now, I don't have anything above that.  If there is something more you need, I am  sorry I can't provide you with that, I don't have anything to say now, this is all I can say.\n They went off and leave me there - they took me in the morning, it was around about nine and they came back after two, I was still hanging with my right arm, it was swollen, the fingers was swollen and I was turning pale green.   When they come back, they just grab me with my feet.  After grabbing me one of them  says wait a little bit, can you kick him on his testicles. \nI couldn't say anything,  unfortunately and fortunately God gave me power.  One of them who was trying to attempt to kick me, I had to scratch my leg, it was me who kicked him on his testicles, not him kicking on me.  He cried and ran off, when he was out, they came back as a mass with guns - they pulled me - I was still hanging then, they pulled me with my  legs - after that, they said to one of them he must untie me and then he did so.   He took the handcuff that was locked up, not the one that was in my hand and he asked them are you ready and they said yes we are.  \nAfter that they just leave me, I fell down and I went unconscious.  I woke up after a while -  when I gained consciousness they were kicking me - jumping over me.  After a while doing that - they took me back to the cell and locked me in.  And when the other fellows asked me Geoffrey what have you done to the boers I told them I did nothing.  I am also interested what I did to them - why are they beating me up so much.  I was swollen that time, my face was swollen.\nAgain the following day they did the same routine, when they arrived, I just asked them to take me to the doctor, can't you see how am I and they say we don't have a doctor for you.  They took me again back to the third floor.  When I arrived there, they hang me with my feet - hang me upside down.  After doing that, they said they will come back, when you  are going to tell us the truth.  When they come back they untie - they untie the cuff on the roof and they let me fell down on the floor.  I knocked with my head down, they kicked me, they were twisting my arms, they were doing everything that can be painful to me.\nI was asking them my dear people what did I  do to you, why don't you kill me rather, because if you kill me I will just die without any pains, because now you are just giving me pains, beating me up, doing everything to me that's painful and they said to me we only want the truth from you, nothing else.  And I told them that I have no truth, this is the only thing that I am saying as far as I know, this is the truth to me and they said to me okay we will show you.\nAnd they beat me up again, they beat me up, it  was a non-stop thing, one was making - they were making turns come in and out, beating me up.  In the afternoon they take me back to the cell.  When I arrived at the cell again, my fellows asked me again what have I done, I just said to him maybe amongst us, there is one who was a sell out and he said I've done something to the boers.  Or maybe in the community where I am living there is someone or maybe among the comrades that I am working with, there is someone who has said to the boers I have done something.\nAnd then the following day again they came to fetch me as usual.   They took me back again to the same room third floor, they did the same thing again, beat me up, beat me up time and again and the person who is in charge there, when they were calling him, they will call him Lieutenant Steyn and there was another guy, Mr Petersen as far as I know.\nThey sent people again to come and beat me up, again in the evening they take me back to the cells.  The following day in the morning, early hours of the morning they came.  At that time I couldn't even walk, I couldn't even do anything, I couldn't even talk.  My body was swollen - every - each and every part of me was swollen and was painful.  Those who were helping me while I was in the cell, it was a next door cell, there were mothers who were there,  these ladies were also comrades.  They were trying their best to help me, so that they tried to rub myself, unfortunately I couldn't do that because my body was swollen, I couldn't even move my arms.  In the cells there was one of the comrades known as Sibongile, he was the one who was helping me to massage my body.\nIn the morning the policeman came in and they said we want Geoffrey,  I answered them.  They said I must come out, it was difficult for me to stand up.  The other comrades inside helped me to stand up, I had to walk slowly going to the door.   After I arrived at the door, they called me hey kaffir will you please hurry up.  And they say come-come quickly.  There were speaking in Afrikaans.\nWhen I said - when I told them not to rush me, because my whole body is painful, can't you just take me to the doctor, or else just give me pain killers, that will at least help me a little bit because my body is aching a lot, they took my arms, twisting them, put them behind my back and handcuffed me.  I cried to them, oh! my fellow people, as I am like this and the one told me not to tell him shit, just come, you dogs of Mandela. \nI walked slowly, they take their guns and point at me and I told them there is nothing I can do and there is nothing I  am able to do.  One of them came behind me and grabbed me on my shoulder and the other one on the other side and then one in front of me - they took me back to the offices, when I arrived in the offices, old men, policemen came out there with red dockets, when they got inside to  the office where I  was, the policeman took me and pushed me right into the corner and I told them not to do this to me, because my body is  very painful.  And they said fok off - fok off you bladdy kaffir.  I didn't say a word, they took me and pushed me into the corner, I just begged to them to take me to the doctor, just for the doctor to give me pain killers, that's the only help I need, nothing more.\nThis policeman came and asked is this the one, and they said now you must do something about him, anything, even if you kill him, anything just do - because he is the one who is pulling us backwards, he is the only one who is giving us a slow down, we must do something about him, we must get rid of this guy and get rid of  this place.\nAfter some few moments Tise came in and took me and I just plead to him not to grab him like this way - I tried my best to stand up, and he said to me I must not tell him shit, you must come.  He dragged me and take me out of the door.  When I was outside I just saw a red car standing there - they took a plastic into the car, at that moment I was tied, my hands were on my back.  They took me and push me into the red car.  One boer policeman came - they got into the car and they take off their guns.\nTise pointed the gun at me and the other one just put the gun in front of me and the car drove off.  I asked them where are we going to, they didn't answer me.  I said to them if you are taking me somewhere else, or if you are going to kill me, can't you just  go and get my clothes or let me go and get my clothes, where I am going to die, I want to die with my clothes and they looked at each other quietly, they just drove off.\nAfter a while I just asked the to turn back, telling them that I just need my clothes, they couldn't care less.  After a moment they turned back again, they went back to the direction of the cells, and they parked at the backyard.  They stopped there - I wanted to get out, they took their guns and point it at me.  One policeman known as Tise, I just ask him to go and fetch my clothes and the other one stood on top of me with this gun pointing at me.  I asked him what do you want to do to me, because it seems as if I have killed someone now and yet I didn't kill  anyone, or else I am a rival.  They didn't answer me, after a while Tise come back with my clothes, they took me then.\nWhen we about to approach the airport, Tise said to me we want to lock you here in Mossel Bay, but you don't want to say the truth and now we are going to kill you.   I said to them it's okay, Steve Biko died a long time ago, he was also killed, it won't be a trouble if I also die  - because I will die for reality.\nThey took me out of the car when we were in the airport, they just make me stand opposite a car, they pointed the guns at me and said we are going to shoot you  now, just tell the truth.  I said there is no truth I can say, this is the only truth I am talking, I am telling you - I know nothing and this is the truth I know.  The one you  know is yours I know nothing, don't - don't oppose what I am saying.\nThey took me again, grab me - pull - push me into the car and they drove off.  When were far away, passed Mossel Bay they said to me you see now, we are going to  take  you to Mossel Bay but now we are going to kill you.  I said to them it's okay you can go and kill me, I am ready to die - and they took me - drove a very long distance passed forest, there was another big forest - when we were just nearer to that forest they  stopped the  car.  We were just about to enter the forest - one policeman said just take this person out and kill him.  They stopped the car and they - they make me stand next to the car - they take their guns out - they locked them and they said we are going to kill you now.\nI said it's okay, and they asked me again to sit -  tell the truth, I  said there is nothing I know, this is the only truth I know, the thing I told you is the only truth and they said there are many  things that happened to George, and everybody in George is pointing your name.  I said to them I for one, I know nothing, this is the only truth ... end of Tape 1, side B   ...   pushed me into the car, we drove off again.  \nWe  [indistinct] a place like a farm this place is known as Herbertsdal - they stopped the car near to a house.  They get off, they said I must also get off - I get off, they got into this house when we were about to get in, when I was in there, I saw two policeman - when I found out, it was a charge office.  \nOne policeman asked - I believe he was in charge - what is this person doing here.  They said no we are coming here to lock him here and the other one of course said no you can't lock him here because you are only keeping people who are going to sleep here for a night - and they opposed him saying that you can't tell us that.  They said to him you will just look after this person.\nAfter a while they went out - I was left inside the house with Tise - they untie my arm - my hands - I  was waiting in here and Tise said to me you've got a - you  are full of shit.  I said to Tise no Tise I am not  like that - the only person to be full of shit it's you and he said to me - I will beat you up  like anything and he said no you can't do that and he grabbed me with my chest.\nI stood and God gave me strength with the left arm that it was not hanged, because the right one was not working.  I also grabbed him, he pushed me - God gave me strength I gave more than his, I also pushed him into the  corner - after a while he wanted to kick me and he said - and I told him you can't do that, the two policeman came inside and asked what was happening and he said this is this dog he is  starting to be nasty.\nAfter a while they came in, and they said  to me I must get out, I went out, on my way out - when I was outside, they took me and we just went around this charge office.  When I was just behind it, I saw a place like a chicken - fowl - I saw a fowl run and they said this is where you are going to stay.  I didn't answer them.  This place had an opening at the back and there was a nest on top and it  was also - had an opening in front.  Under the door there was also an opening - and they said to me this is where you are going to stay - up until you say the truth.  They just pushed me in there.\nThey locked me in there and here inside there was a mat and a rug and a bucket - and a bucket full of water and they said you are going to stay here and you'll see what you can do up until you say the truth.  I stayed there, when it was about to be the evening it was starting to be dark, I heard a shout outside someone was shouting - come closer to the door - I do as he was saying, they were opening the door.  When they opened the door - the - a gun pointed at me - I stood back.\nAfter a while again I saw there was a dish with two slices of bread with half a cup of coffee - the voice said take - I didn't see any hand or - and I took that plate and the cup and they closed the door again.  I stayed there eating that meal, day and night - every time I was there, that was my meal - I just can't remember how many days or months approximately three months.  I was living there - I was living there out of  God's will and out of his power, because I  was tying my trousers with the rags because they were falling down, I think I was a little bit slim.\nThere came a time while the State of Emergency was uplifted - it was after a while Petersen came there they told me that they were going to take me somewhere else, so I must give in the statement.  I told them I can't because there is nothing I  can say, my statement is I don't know.  He gave me some documents to write in the statement, I just crashed off and then signed at the bottom and he took those documents back to him again.  \nAfter a while some policeman came in here - in there - they were there to fetch me  - they said I must go and be locked in George.  They take me there and we were in Mossel Bay police station, they stopped.  After a while we drove off to George, while I was here in George, that was the place where they were going to lock me in.  We stayed there for some time, what happened while I was on my way to  the cell - they take me in, I saw all the comrades that I was in struggle with, they were in there, fortunately and unfortunately they couldn't know me.  I tried to identify myself to them, they said no man it's not you Jeff - I told them it's me.\nAnd they asked me have you seen you - have you exactly seen you - I said to them no - I haven't seen myself - I just remember myself while - while I was at my home - that is the only time I could identify myself, after that I have never seen a mirror - I have never seen myself in a mirror again.  They brought me a mirror - I had to look myself on my mirror.  When I  looked at myself, I couldn't believe it was me - because I  was not the Jeff that I know.\nI was not surprised when everybody said they couldn't identify me and they don't know me - as from then - they gave me charges, six of  them - four were charges of assault - two were charges of  peoples court.  Now what was happening to my body  at that time - it - my body was painful, even it is painful now.  \nAfter they released me I tried to go to the doctor for some examinations, fortunately and unfortunately Pillay said to them if you are going to open an case, I won't be able to help you, you must not open a case and lay a charge, because I will be delayed in my work if - because I have to also look at this charge you are going to lay.  He examined me - he said he  can do nothing to me, although I  was sick and he noticed that I was sick.\nAs from then I  was just going to my appointments time and again, I stayed for a while under those pains, my body acing.  During 1989 and 1990 I am not sure exactly which year was it,  policeman came back again where I was staying.   They came at night - when they were there, there was only one policeman who came inside, I  was busy washing up myself, because I  was on my way to Cape Town, we were having a meeting there, UDF meeting.  \nThis policeman kicked my door and let himself inside - while the policeman was inside he just stood and stared at me, he asked what I was doing.   I told him that he can't - he just can't me ask that question, I stand up, I grabbed him, I throw him out of the door and closed my door.  If I told - I told him that if you don't have respect, you must stay outside - I stayed there.  After a while I heard the sound of cars parking outside - I just heard people surrounding the place where I was - after a while I heard a knock  on the door.  I asked who was it, they said just open the door we are the policeman.   I opened the door, they asked why are you hitting one of us, I said to them if  one doesn't have respect, you must show him respect.  You just can't enter in any man's house and kick his door, where do you get that permission to do that.\nWhile I was saying that, they jumped to me, they beat me up - fortunately and unfortunately God gave me strength again.  I grabbed one of them, I pulled him up and throw him on top of the others  while I was trying to fight - seeing that I am defeating those who were inside, they crowd and called the one's who were outside, they all came in, they pulled me outside the house.\nWhen I was outside, I don't know whether it  was dark or white with policeman but the place was full of policeman - some had long - had long  [indistinct] so I don't know whether they went and fetched the Army - the whole Army I had no idea.  They beat me up again while I was outside, I  tried my best to fight because my procedure was not like that just a man come and beat me, I tried to fight, unfortunately while I was fighting one of  the ladies who was also a comrade, they were also policemen while she  was still on the streets, they were trying to protect him not to come  they tried to chase away other people with guns - when this people were approaching they chased them away.\nAnd then this lady  comes, he  - she asked what was going on, and the policeman tried to block her and my neighbour came - she was also a mother and she couldn't give them a chance and just went inside and she told them not to beat me up and he said to me Jeff don't fight against this people, because there are many of them - they may kill you.  I asked to them what are they looking for, and they said no there is someone we were chasing and he just went inside your house, so we are looking for him.\nAnd this mother said okay just  come with me and look for this person, they went inside - while they were inside they just looked around looking at the placards and the posters that were hanging on the wall.  Mandela's poster was also there, they just looked around, on their way  out, this woman said these people came here just for nothing, they just came here to beat you up because they didn't check the house looking for someone and they said to this woman now we are going to take this guy - fortunately and unfortunately this women couldn't allow it that thing to happen.  Although the policeman were more than the women, they wanted to take me.\nWhat happened while they were on their way,  I saw  Mawusa whom was working with them - he was also a policeman and one Coloured policeman called Fletcher.  I just met them - I just - I didn't say anything, I just look at them, I went an lay a charge - there was nothing - nothing had happened it just vanished - I will stop there.",
