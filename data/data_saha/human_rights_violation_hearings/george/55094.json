He went up to Cape Town three times to the courts.\n Most of the time during the struggle time I was a worker, by the time he was sentenced, the court cases were - that was his mother, was moving up and down.  I just can remember when was Mike being sentenced, but I can - I can remember that it was March, policeman came to me at work - they come and told me that Mike was being sentenced to life - he was going to be hanged on Friday.\n We didn't know whether Mike had committed the crime, they said Mike has shot a policeman.  Police said they will take me to Fort Beaufort and then from there I  will take a train to Pretoria and  [indistinct]  they came and tell me that on Wednesday, when I arrived hom, I told my sister that situation.  Our church priest, Father Bailey came as soon as he could, he came to  give condolences and give us support, he said he will support us with finance and we will go to Pretoria.   We were taken to Pretoria by Father Bailey.\n The most painful part of this situation my - was Mike the only first criminal that his case could just take only one month and be hanged during that month?  That was the only question and it's still the only question in our minds.",

            "Thank you Ms Lucas - your Grace perhaps you would allow me to tell Ms Lucas that after we had received her statement, we did speak to the advocate who represented Michael Lucas and brought a plea for clemency after he had been sentenced to death.  And he did tell us that although it was in fact a very short time between the  time that Michael Lucas was sentenced, and executed that all the procedures, the legal procedures were properly followed.\n That it was a time when those decisions were being taken quickly and the case was processed quickly.  But she should know that - that legally the procedures were properly followed.\n Michael was charged together with two others in this case - the other two people were Jerome Myo and Eric Phote and they both escaped having the death penalty passed on them.  Partly because of the evidence which Michael Lucas gave.  The Court did not believe all of his evidence, but he was able to avoid the other two receiving the death sentence.  And we can't know that, but maybe that was part of his objective in the evidence that he did give.  And perhaps afterwards I could take a little more to Ms Lucas about what advocate Michael  Donen told me about this case.",

He was a bus inspector who was protecting the buses in a time of a bus boycott in the area and he - he either had links with or had worked for the Security Police in the area.\n We have not received a statement from - from his family, but is it something that we will need to pursue, and I wondered whether you would allow me to read briefly from advocate Donen's letter to the State President, asking for clemency on behalf of Michael Lucas, because I think it helps to establish the context.",

            "Thank you - he says\nEven if a Court of Law understands the misguided frustration of person's in Michael's position, the connection between misguided frustration and extenuation, is to tenuous to constitute extenuation for the purposes of Law.\nBut you Mr State President, being better informed that the legal profession is, posses a better understanding of how a young man with idealistic religious and political believes such as Michael Lucas can be caught up  in a spiral of violence which eventually leads him in the absence of any genuine political opposition to  charge at political windmills such as bus services with fatal consequences.\nI therefore appeal to you  to attempt to appreciate Michael's frustration and on this ground to mitigate his sentence.\nI submit further more that there are sound quality reasons not to execute Michael.  Bhongolethu the black township outside Oudtshoorn, is one of the most economically deprived townships in the Western Cape.\nEconomic depravation is one of the basic reasons why Michael became involved in this so-called freedom struggle which inevitably led to his  downfall.  \nThe township was caught up in the spiral of violence which designated this  country during 1985.  The bitter deception between the black community and the white, as well as between a large proportion of Bhongolethu's population, and the black persons who allegedly collaborated with the white authorities, grows.\nSome  [indistinct] or another Michael's community perceive the resort to violence as a solution to the economic depravation.  Michael himself as the evidence at his trial revealed, was a committed Christian and was well regarded by his community.  As such he is capable of rehabilitation and his community would regard his execution with horror.\nI therefore respectfully submit to you Mr State President, that the commuting of his death sentence, as a matter of strategic policy would serve to a swage tensions in the community of Bhongolethu and allow the sentence which he actually receives to serve as a symbol of reconciliation rather than confrontation.",
