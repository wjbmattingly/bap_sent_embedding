            "Chairperson,  I'd like to read a summery of our research notes which will give us a idea of the  nature of the events that took place 1987 and 1988 - during the time Thabo Metsing  was shot by kitskonstabels.  \nIn February 1987 six \"Green Flies\" - that is municipal police - were recruited from Victoria West and began living in the Coloured township of Rustdene.  They patrolled KwaMandlekosi, which was the township in Beaufort West, day and night.\nSome times they used a Administration Board van but mostly patrolled all together on foot.  They were armed with 9 mm hand guns and carried shot guns over the weekends.  They carried out the duties of the Administration Board such as issuing  Summonses for rent.\nIn May 1987 6 kitskonstabels returned from training in Koeberg, Cape and were joined in June by 4 more.  Apparently the kitskonstabels were told they were being trained as Security Guards before they were recruited and when some wanted to leave, they were told they would be jailed for 5 years if they left the Force.  \nThe kitskonstabels were recruited by the South African Police in a caravan, which came to the township offering a wage of R300-00 per month.  The people recruited were mostly unemployed, desperate men.  The highest standard of education passed by a member of this group, was Std 7. \nThe kitskonstabels patrolled in groups of 2 or more and curried shotguns.  Captain Van Rensburg was in charge of the kitskonstabels and a policeman called Marks handled all complains against them.  \nMarks was reportedly of an aggressive and threatening to people when they reported the bad conduct of one of his men.  Residents stated that little to nothing was done about their complains. \n The residence of KwaMandlenkosi rejected the kitskonstabels because of their aggressive way they treated residence.  Residence  were badly beaten  by the kitskonstabels when drunk.   It was reported that  the kitskonstabels would go to the shebeen owners in  the township and  demanded drink.   \nIf they refused they were told they would be closed down,  so many obliged.  It was also reported that the kitskonstabels new the activists in the community and intimidated and threatened them regularly.  And during this period 5 people, including the witness standing before us, was shot in Beaufort West by the kitskonstabels.",

            "I was from town, I had been sent to town on a Saturday.  I think it was approximately between - past 10, something to 11.  And I saw these blou doeks near the shanty town, where my aunt was staying.  They called me and I went to them and they said   You've been silly for a long time.  And the one blou doek by the name of Vilapue was fat, said that I had been silly for a long time and I said  What had I done?  And he said  You have been silly for a long time.  Don't give us a hard time.  Just don't be silly.  I just said  Look, I haven't done anything.  And they asked me - they said  If Skonkwani doesn't shoot you, we - you - I'm going to shoot you.   \nAnd I left.  When I got home I left the things and went forward. When I got to a certain place I saw Skonkwani and I was shot and when I looked I saw that Skonkwani was shooting me and he shot me on my back.  When I wanted to run away, I fell and when I got up he  - tried to get up again he shot me a second time.  And these are pellets that spread when they strike you. \nAnd James Diamond and Banana picked me up and took me to the hospital.  I was admitted to hospital and stayed there for 6 days - I think it was about 6 days for which I lay there - before I was sent to Tygerberg Hospital, in Cape Town.   \nI came back in January - I think it was early in January - I know that I spent my new years day here at home.  When I came back from hospital, I saw James Diamond and a attorney coming to my place who was - the attorney was Matxharbey.\nMatxharbey  then proceeded with my case  here in Beaufort West and the trial continued. I think it started in 1991 - 1991 or 1989 - I'm not sure.  And everything continued  and we then had to go to the Supreme   Court in Cape Town.  I'm not to sure which court it was, but it was in Cape Town. \nWhen we got there, everything - as far as my claims - was sorted out and I was told that I would get my money after 3 weeks.  I waited for 3 weeks for my money and I think in 1992 I borrowed money from this attorney and he gave me \nR6,420-00.  I didn't receive any other money after that,  that was the only money he gave me.  I think he said that that was my claim. And I assumed that was it because I don't see any other money forthcoming.",
