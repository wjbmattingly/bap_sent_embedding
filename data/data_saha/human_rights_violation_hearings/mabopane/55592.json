They said they were looking for, then they said I am not there I went to a certain place called Mabopane when I returned  home, at home on the 27th they arrested me. After that they immediately assaulted me there then from there they put me in their van. I  remember police Kavambo they took me to Temba police station, there I was tortured they put a sackcloth on my head they kicked me, after that they took me to the cell with some comrades.   They took us to Bedwang police station we stayed in Bedwang. At home they were looking for us but they couldn't find us. After Bedwang we were taken to (...indistinct) prison. Whilst we were still at (...indistinct) prison lawyers came looking for us. They found us there. I was injured. When I was trying to pass water I was bleeding.   When we went to court before, they said they are looking for guns, because I'm a communist, but I said I'm not working with the communist they said we know there are people that told us that you are working with the communists, but  I said I don't know anything, they I told them that we'll meet in court, they returned me to court.\n Whilst we were in prison our comrades used to come and visit us. In September on the 19th in 1976, they give us a free bail, we stayed at home. The police used to come at home looking for me they were asking me about my fellow comrades but I told them that I've nobody that I'm working with. They told me that they will get me one day because I'm difficult. After that they said myself and together with the comrades, they said to us we knew that we have killed a person. Then they told us that we will meet in court. A certain policeman called Kavangwa was the one person making those accusation.    Whilst we were attending that court case in 1987 on  5th of May, that is where we were sentenced for death it was myself, Modise and Thomas Makobele we were taken to Ryghond we stayed in 1986 in Ryghond from 1987. They are not with me now and that is disturbing me because those police I want to know them, why did they take me to prison, because I nearly died for something that I didn't know.",
