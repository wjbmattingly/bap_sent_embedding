            "I'm Reuben Gallant and I live in Douglas.  On the 9th of November 1990 I was at home - I was busy planting grass.  It was between 10 and 11 in the morning when three police vans arrived at our house.  My father, Benjamin Gallant was sitting in front of our gate and when the three police vans arrived my brother Isak came out of the house.  And the policemen who jumped out of the van were known as Man Alleen  and Venter.  They were the two white policemen.\nAnd they walked passed my father and they approached Isak, they wanted to arrest him.  I walked up to them and I was busy planting the grass.  I left my spade where I was busy planting the grass and I went up to them to ask them why they wanted to arrest my brother.  And whether they had any documents or warrants to - to show what they were arresting him for.  \nThey didn't answer me and then a fight erupted, my brother tried to break free and ran around the house.  There's a triangle - triangle behind our house and this shuffle continued until they reached this triangular part  and Isak then broke free from the policemen and ran away.  He jumped over the fence in the back of our yard and then ran away.  And then I asked Venter, the Warrant Officer - I asked him once again what the reason was why they wanted to arrest my brother and at that stage Constable - his name is actually - his nickname is Man Alleen then said to him  Shoot the dog, kill him.  Man Alleen then shot me or Warrant Officer Venter shot me.  He used tear gas, he used a long shot gun and he tear gassed me and he shot me in my left eye and I fell.\nI lost consciousness and when I came to I was in the police cells.  I was full of blood, they told me that I've been taken to a doctor but I don't know because I was unconscious.  In the afternoon round about 5 o'clock they brought me here to Kimberley and - two white policemen brought me here but I can't remember their names, unfortunately.  And along the way they stopped and said that I must get out of the car because I'm making a mess with my blood all over the car.  And then I lay on the grass, they were busy drinking something but I don't know whether it was alcohol or cooldrinks.\nAnd I lay there and then they came to and said carry on making a mess, you used to making a mess, here you are now lying on the ground.  And when I regained my consciousness I was in Kimberley Hospital and after a couple of days my eye was permanently removed.  And that is the condition in which I sit here today, my eye has been removed, I don't know for how long I was there.\nBefore I forget, whilst I was in hospital, there was a policeman - he was guarding me, he was sitting at the door and it seems to me that they were scared that I would try and run away.  And after a couple of days Detective Zepe came to fetch me from the hospital and he was supposed to take me to Douglas but on that day they first brought me to the cells here in Kimberley.   And I was detained there with some other people and they treated me well.\n On the next day I was taken to Douglas but we drove through Ritchie - this is a little town close to  Kimberley and then I was taken to Douglas and detained.  The charge brought against me was kidnapping and I don't understand that charge.  They couldn't explain to me what this kidnapping was supposed to be and on the 24th of the 5th 1991  - I laid a charge against the Warrant Officer Venter but unfortunately the case was dismissed.  The Attorney General decided not to prosecute.",
