I sat on the wall at the four-way stop in the township and we went back to Arena and that's where I saw where the march came from.\nAnd then we got into the cars and we drove off and everything was still fine.  And we went all the way to town and when we arrived here I wasn't told what the whole cause of the trouble was when I got into the car - that was never explained to me.  What then happened is that the Major asked me, this is Lawrence Mbatha that I am referring to, the Commander of the Northern Cape.\nWe went up and he then took me to the OK Centre at the four-way, it's a four-way stop and there were lots of  people because there were lots of people and it was time to go home and we got off there.\nWhen I got out of the car there I wasn't informed of any grenade or anything - I was just given a piece of paper, a wrapped up piece of paper and there was a grenade inside - there was a grenade inside the paper.",

But you see I have no experience of this type of thing and when we went up it was all right and when we got there the petitions were handed over, the first petition, the second petition and the third petition - when it was time to hand over the third petition, then there was a sign that I must throw this grenade.  And he laid down at the same time,  so when I threw it I was weak I had had no experience of this type of thing and then I threw the grenade and then I felt very sad for the harm that  I caused and I heard somebody had died and I felt very bad.
