I have been very involved in the ANC activities which actually at a time led to my arrest during the State of Emergency.  Because I think the reason was I  was then working in the DESCOM which is a detainee's support parents committee because we use to help the children with funds who were in Bougroep and Transvaal Road.\n And the only thing I really experienced is let me say I am not sorry to have been active in the ANC.  The only thing which I am a little  bit sorry, I was never happy at work, because I use to be called Winnie Mandela.  I make myself Winnie Mandela.  But well because of poverty and everything I had to stick out working.  But as from today -  as today I am still active in the ANC.\n I have been instrumental in building up the Women's League in the Northern Cape when the ANC was un-banned, I was one of the people who was called to organise for the Woman's League and most of the branches I launched in the Northern Cape - thank you.",

            "Okay, my son Khotso Flatela was born 1967 in Kimberley.  He attended school St Boneface from primary to high school.  But he was expelled when he was doing Std 9 because of his political involvement.  In 1985 he was briefly detained and his charges were public violence.  But after three months they were withdrawn.\nBut shortly after that he was again detained for they said that it was an alleged murder  of an informer.  He stayed for nine months in Bougroep and then again the charges were withdrawn. After that it was in December when they were withdrawn of the very same year, I think it was in 1985.\nAnd then he came out and still continued with his activity.  He then belonged to the then GAZO youth organisation, which was a   [indistinct]  student organisation.  So when the police started harassing him again I skipped the country, that was immediately after the 21st of March when we celebrated the Sharpville day, so we skipped after that, late March - early April.\nI never heard of him, I never knew where his whereabouts were.  Until when I first heard about him, I got a telegram from Lusaka - the telegram stated that he met with an accident but it was not stated what kind of accident.  So as a mother I phoned Lusaka, but I can't say who answered the phone because he didn't disclose his name.  He said to me, the person who was talking to me - no we have never sent such a telegram, we don't know of  such a thing.\nOkay,  but this thing worried me time and again.  So as their lawyer when they were still at prison was Chris Naidoo of Johannesburg, I went to Chris Naidoo in Johannesburg.  I wanted him to at least to  find out for me what has really happened.  So when I got to Johannesburg, Chris Naidoo phoned Lusaka because I had the phone numbers on the telegram.  The telegram was signed by comrade Alfred  Nzo.\nSo Chris Naidoo said that Lusaka said he must phone back after an hour and then we waited - and then after a hour the phone came back from Lusaka, they said that they never sent such a telegram.   But deep down in my heart, I knew that something must have happened to this child.  How can people of the organisation who our leaders can sent such a telegram and then there is nothing is like that.\nSo Chris Naidoo advised me to come back home, that I must just stay put at home, he is still going to investigate this thing.  Then I sent a message I left with him, I said Mr Chris Naidoo if the child is dead, you must please ask them not to bury him, I'll try my best to go to Lusaka, at least to be  [indistinct]    So after three days, I think it was on the 18th of December, because I received the telegram on the 12th of December and they stated that the child met with an accident on the 7th of December.",

            "On the 18th Chris Naidoo 'belled' [phoned] and said that they have confirmed that the child did die in a accident, but they can't say what sort of an accident.  So I prepared myself to go to Lusaka, but when Chris Naidoo phoned he said that and unfortunately they said that they buried the child on the 16th of December.  I don't know why they did that because I asked them that the mother said that they must not bury the child if the child is dead.\n Okay, so but all and all I went to Lusaka.  When I got to Lusaka, we were housed in a sort of a guest house, the mother of that house was Ms Kwana I don't know was it her real name or was it a combat name.  But  she said that she was from Swaziland.  So I asked around a little bit was there any funeral on the 16th of December around here and then the only thing he could tell - she could tell me - she said that the only funeral they had was an elderly man who died of natural causes.\n Then I don't know what to think and then okay, we slept because I left with my sister.  The following day comrade mamma Ruth came to us.  And again I asked her how did this child die - and she repeated that she died in an accident - what kind of an accident - no a car accident - was he driving or what - what has happened - no it is just a accident, a car accident.\n Okay I left it like that, so after about 30 minutes while we were sitting with mamma Ruth, comrade Steve Tshwete and Alfred Nzo came to us and then they just told me that I should be brave - I must not cry because they did get the report that I've been - also an activist - very active in the movement and they thank me for that.  But all in all another story emerged after I've met comrade Steve Tshwete and comrade Alfred Nzo, they told me that no the child didn't die in Lusaka.  He died in Luanda, which was now a total different story, he died in Luanda.\n And they had to bury the child - when I asked them where did you bury the - no because there are no more   [indistinct]  in Luanda, it was already nine days the child had died so we had to bury him.  And then mamma Ruth said to me, okay since there are comrades MK-comrades who usually come when their families come and visit them, they come once a week - so you will have to stay for the week here, and then the plane which leaves for Angola goes only on a Tuesday.\n So we will go with you at least that you can see your child's funeral - your child's grave and you'll meet some other comrades who know you there, who will be very glad to see you.  Okay we stayed there for a week, but the Monday mamma Ruth came again and said it's a pity you can't go to Luanda or Angola because the planes will be fired, will be shot down by the Savimbi troops.  I was devastated, my heart was broken, then I asked mamma Ruth - mamma Ruth what do you mean, what am I going to tell the people at home - at least if - at least if I saw the grave at least I would feel a little bit better and I would believe that the child is dead.\n Especially now there are so many stories, the other one comes with car accident in Lusaka, now the other comrades come with in Luanda - now what should I believe, really what should I believe.  Then I asked mamma Ruth okay mamma Ruth since then I have just come here for nothing, going back heart sore, will you give me the death certificate so at least there are policies which I've included him, that I can go and claim that money.  And then mamma Ruth said no because it's Christmas time, it's holiday it was already over Christmas -  I stayed for  two weeks there, since it's Christmas time the offices are closed and all that.  \n Within two weeks time you will get the death certificate.  Up till today I am still waiting for that death certificate.  Mamma Ruth came back from exile, I went to her again, I kept pestering her to tell me the truth what is the real truth and where is the death certificate.  At the end of the day we became enemies.\n So I don't know till today if only this Commission if my child is - I  am going to accept that he is dead, but really it is heart sore to be told lies - because at the end of the day there was another comrade who was also in exile with Khotso.  When he came back, I met him, in fact I thanked him for  what he did, because he went to my place and told  me that comrade these people have been misleading you.  They didn't tell you the truth, I know the truth I was with Khotso, he landed on a landmine.\n Now when I ask mamma Ruth - mamma Ruth why did - why have you been telling me lies all these years - it's eight years I have been suffering - I wanted to know my child how he died, she just said to me - no I only told you what I  was told, just like that.\n I think the only thing I am going to ask from this Commission is just to tell me that - to find out the truth for me, how  he died, I mean he - it doesn't become so painful at least when you know where did your child end, how he died and only if the leadership of our organisation could just tell me the truth.",
