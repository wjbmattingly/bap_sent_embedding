<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIGO:</span> I am Daisy Mashigo, I stay in 58 3rd Avenue.  It was on Saturday, we were coming from the funeral.  When we came out of the burial when we were in the double up, the police shot us with their tear-gas and I ran home looking for my children.  They were not there.  I went out looking for them and I met Anna. I asked her where are my children and she told me that she was also looking for her children.  And then I heard that someone was hitting me with a stone and I fell down.  They shot me in the back and I regained consciousness in the hospital.</p>

They were white men and Mtebi asked me what happened when I was in hospital and he wanted me to point out the people who shot me and then I said I don't know them because there were many and they were in their Caspers.</p>
