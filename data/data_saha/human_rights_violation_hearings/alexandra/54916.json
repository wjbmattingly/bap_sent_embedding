They are fighting for their rights as students.  They were against the use of Afrikaans.  Because they were black students we had to support them.  We started on the Third Avenue at the beer hall.  We were chanting freedom songs.  Then we went to the health committee.  Whilst singing there the policemen started shooting.  That is where the whole trouble started on that day.  We fought with the policemen from the health committee.  Then we went to the buses.  When we got to the buses the policemen were there, they were shooting.  We ran away towards the beer hall side, next to the cinema.  And when we got there there was already chaos, the bottle store was burnt.  People were looting alcohol.  We ran away up until Sixth Avenue and that is where they shot my friend there, on Sixth Avenue.  I was hurt because when I looked back I saw that he was just in a blood bath, I couldn't even see his head.  We ran off and then we got onto Seventh Avenue the policemen were fighting with the school children and I decided to fight no matter what happens to me.  I fought with these policemen and some police vans appeared from Eighth Avenue.  They were shooting\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 MALINGA\nall the time and that is when they hit me at the back.  And this bullet went right through the left arm, next to the ribs.  And they arrested me on 12th Avenue.  Bleeding like that they put me into a van and dropped me off at the clinic.  I stayed at the clinic from the morning and I was only attended to at about five o'clock in the afternoon.  From there on I was handcuffed and then they said they were taking me to the General.  I stayed there for two weeks.  When I got back I met Mtibi.  He asked as to are you still alive, I didn't respond.  I didn't respond to Mtibi's question.  They took me to Brits at the farm, there is a farmer there by the name of Makagala.  I was working on that farm with this wound, with no medical treatment.  This went on for three months and they brought me to (indistinct).  That is where I was released.  Nobody knew where I was.  I was scared to tell my parents where I was and what I was doing because my parents didn't like the things that we did as the youth.  They were religious people.  I didn't want to tell them because they would beat me up and chase me out from the house.  I didn't tell them about all issues about the meetings that we are attending.  Nobody took care of me.  From there on my father took me to the farm areas to stay there for a period of about a year and then I came back in December 1976.  I don't remember the date clearly.",

They must all come, even the Cabassas.  They must come forward and reveal the truth.  Maybe we might forgive them.  But if they don't come forward I would never be happy, there will never be peace amongst us.  What I can say is we have been long waiting for the Commission.  We didn't know where to take our grievances to and we thank the ANC and the Truth Commission for giving us this opportunity to relive our stories and even those people that we harmed, they must please forgive us.  We were only victims of apartheid and even those white men that we injured, they must please forgive us.",

What is very ... (nothing further on tape) ... what you say is that you spent three months on a farm without really being properly charged and it is a matter that we\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n11 MALINGA\nshould actually look at very carefully to find out why the normal channels of justice were bypassed.  We hear you when you say that you are without a job today.  That you even lost your wife.  We share your pain in all the things that have been done to you and we will investigate the matter and try and come back to you on what you have told us today.  Thank you for coming and in the same way that you have appealed for people to come forward we appeal to those people who may even be sitting amongst us that if you have committed gross human rights violations that you should come forward and make an application for amnesty. We do have our statement takers who are in activity room 1 and if you have information to give or to share or if you want to know more about amnesty they are available to assist you.  The cry of victims right around the country is to know who did it and why they did it.  That is one of the functions of the Commission, to find out who did it and why they did it.  We thank you for coming today to tell us what happened to you.",
