<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>MS MKHIZE:  We greet you, Mam.  You have been waiting for a long time since morning up to this time but we are happy that you have your time.  You are here in front of the Commission, Truth Commission, today.  Before I hand over to the person who will be leading you in your evidence I would like you to stand up to take an oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">SEKITLA ANNA MOGANO:</span> (s.s.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Mam Mogano we would like to welcome you and thank you for staying on to come and tell us your stories which in fact is a story in two parts about your two sons, one from 1985, one from 1990.  If you could just tell us about what happened to them starting with Silas in 1985 and then your second son in 1990.  Please feel that you can speak in your own time and in your own words.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> My son Silas on the 7th March 1985, it was on a Sunday, he said he was going out.  Since he left at that time he never came back again.  On the Monday we started enquiring about him.  I told people to go and look for him at his friends but he was not there.  Even the friends were asking where Silas was.  That happened until the whole week.  We were surprised that how can he disappear for the whole week.  We went to the police station.  We produced his photo, we told the police that he disappeared and we were looking for some help.  They said we must go to the mortuary of number 4 because there are people who have been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>ALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>2 MOGANO</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>We went to that mortuary but he was not there.  We went to John Vorster Square but he was not there.  We came back home.  We were so confused because we didn't even have a clue but we left his photo at the police station.  We were confused.  After five years, on the 7th March 1990 Matepe, one of my children, he was killed by the white men.  We were in the house, it was during the night, it was on a Friday.  He left, he said he was going to school, he was going to study there.  He was a student in one of the schools in town.  He was in Braamfontein, he was doing standard 10.  When he left it was round about half past 8.  After a few minutes we heard gun fire three times.  His brother Lucas went out to see what was happening.  He said here is Matebe, he is shot.  We went out, my Matebe fell down.  We saw a van, a white man's van driving away.  We asked him what was happening, he said those people shot me. We took Matebe to the house, we were still wondering what to do.  He was still talking.  His brother went out and got a car.  He asked for some help and he told the man that Matebe is shot by the boers.  They took Matebe to the clinic with the car.  When they arrived at the clinic Matebe died on arrival. They came back, they told me that when we arrived at the clinic Matebe was certified dead.  I lost strength, my brother Molepo and Lucas they made funeral arrangements.  I was very sick and weak, I couldn't go to the mortuary, I couldn't do anything because I was very weak at the time.  On a Saturday morning we got the canisters, they took them to the police station, they were in my gate, they were right at the gate at home.  The police asked if we knew the people, we said no we don't know them.  We just saw this car that was driving away, we don't even know who were the people. There was no case</p>

<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>3 MOGANO</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>because we didn't know whom to accuse.  We made arrangements for the funeral.  The most painful thing he left a girl who was three months pregnant.  This girl brought the child to me, I was working for the Council and I used to take this child with me and I had to take the child to the creche, pre-school and now I am not working, I don't know how am I going to support this child.  This is the most painful thing in my life.  What is he going to eat because I am not working now.  I don't have money.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Thank you very much, Mama.  If I could ask a few questions just to make the story clearer for us and start with Matepe and the child.  How old is the child now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> On the 18th September he will be seven years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And the mother, are you looking after her as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> I don't even know his mother.  When I went to check her at her home they said she left with other gentlemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Then if I could go back to the disappearance of Silas in 1985.  Could you tell us a little bit more about him, how old was he.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> He was born in 1957. He was working.  He was born in 1957.  He had disappeared in 1985.  He was working.  MR LEWIN:  You described him in your statement as having been a 1976 comrade.  In 1976.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And a member of the UDF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> I am not sure about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Was he active politically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> I only know that he was a comrade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>ALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>4 MOGANO</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And do you have - have you ever heard anything more about him or have you any idea what happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> No, I know nothing.  I heard nothing about him.  MR LEWIN:  When you went to John Vorster Square, you say in your statement they told you to go to Mandela to find out about him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> ... with Shell House, whether his name is there amongst missing people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> I have been to all the places but I couldn't find him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And then going on now to Matepe and 1990.  You say it was a yellow car or was it a yellow police van that you saw driving off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> So it was a police van was it, or a car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> All I know it was the white man that used to visit my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And were these policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> Yes, it was white policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And when you spoke to your son after he had been shot he said those men shot me. Is that right?  So he saw who shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> Yes, he told me so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Was he involved politically as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> Yes, he was the leader of the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> ... the police said that he was misleading the youth and that he had guns.  Did you ever see him with guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> ... they wanted to attack him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> They used to come home looking for him, they</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>ALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>5 MOGANO</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>said he is teaching other children to write on the walls.  I asked if they had seen him doing that, they said yes some people told them.  I told them to bring that person to me.  They said they won't do that.  I told them that they must that person who told them that, they must bring that person to me, he must explain to me when he saw him writing on the walls.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And after he died you say nothing was done.  Was there a post mortem?  Was there a case?  No case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> We were unable to open the case because we didn't know those people.  Because even after his death they came to me and asked for him and I asked why were they asking me that question because they told me that they were going to kill him but I was unable to open the case against anybody because I didn't know the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And could you identify them now?  Would you know who they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> I don't know them.  I don't know those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Thank you very much, Mama.  I will pass you back to the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Thank you, Mam.  We are going to make a follow up.  Did Silas have any friends before his disappearance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> He used to have some friends on 14th Avenue but on that day of his disappearance we went to his friends and we enquired there but all they said is that they don't know anything.  I don't know today where are those friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Did they try to help you maybe by giving you some clues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> When I went to 12th Avenue they referred me to 14th Avenue and I went there.  I was told that he was not there.  Even the friends who were staying on 12th Avenue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>ALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>6 MOGANO</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>They told me the same thing that they didn't see him on that particular day. </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Was he a student or was he working at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> He was working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> What about his friends that he was working with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOGANO:</span> It is old man, old married man.  We didn't go to them and they didn't see him on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Thank you Mam.  Thank you for coming.  One of the things that the Truth Commission is charged with is to assist families with information which will clarify for them as to what happened to people who disappeared and we are hoping that our investigative unit will assist us to be able to confirm whether people died so that families can be able to perform whatever rituals which are important for them in honour of their beloved ones.  In our case it is sad to hear that you lost both your sons during the difficult years in the history of our country.  We will be in touch with you with whatever information which we have got.  We have noted the name of the child, although we didn't get the name of the child, Matsepe's child, we have noted that there is a child whom you are looking after who needs assistance with education.  We thank you very much for coming.</p>
