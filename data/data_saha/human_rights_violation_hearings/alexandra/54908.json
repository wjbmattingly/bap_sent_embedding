We would really appreciate it if you can help us to understand the nature of the conflict that we have been hearing about between different groups here in Alexandra, especially as it related to your displacement.  If you can just tell us a little bit about yourself and then give details about your own story.",

The bullets this side on 3rd Avenue, on your side.  And when I came out of that Double Up, I was trying to double up short cut so that I must reach home quickly, I find my other son is busy with a big truck taking all my household, putting it in that truck and I cried, I said why are you doing that, he said everybody is running away, is moving, how can you stay with these people when things are going on like this.  The\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 GRANT\nshooting was going on, we couldn't even - some things were getting broken to pieces.  I couldn't even have patience, I was just crying, the bullets were just going like this, missing people.  Then I said to my son where am I going, he says no you will have to see where will go like the people are going to the Council.  Then I was dumped at the Council from 1992 up to now and even there at the Council there is no peace, it is not a nice place for a person like me to stay.  There is always fightings around, people just starting with nothing.  You don't know what is the cause of the trouble.  It is too much and those people who are staying in our houses, where do they come from.  Are we not people, are we animals?  We must suffer through the other people.  Where did they stay?  Where do they come from when they come and occupy our houses?  To them we are just like you know just like a piece of paper.  People have got no manners to talk nicely to people, they just take you roughly.  Plenty of my things are lost, everybody has got my things, people are just putting things which they don't know to whom does it belong.  But because I depend on God Almighty Jesus how many years are we start there by the Council, we are like sardines if you can come and see, what little room am I staying in the Council.  With daughters.  I can't even wash myself, I must ask them to go outside.  Is that the life I am living for the sake of those people that I don't know where do they come from.  Where do they belong.  My late father's property is being occupied by other people.  I am suffering like a mad dog.",

On the day when you came back home and found your son putting everything in a big truck can you indicate to us as to how many families were in those circumstances, families who had to leave their places of abode?",

Sometimes I used to sit by the stoep there by the verandah and say to my child oh my heart, I don't know why, I just feel worried.  Then I said there, I smelt a corpse, really just now I will see the people coming to pick up that corpse.  People were being slaughtered.  People couldn't even walk in that street.  It is a main street that goes to Queue township, goes to the taxis.  It is always busy.  People couldn't even pass comfortably, you are being stabbed, you are being shot.
