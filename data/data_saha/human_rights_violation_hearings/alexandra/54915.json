            "It was on a Tuesday night, I don't remember the date clearly because it is quite a long time.  We had gone to Roma to go and see a car that we were involved in an accident whilst we were on our way to the meeting.  When we came back we realised that this car had run away so we left the car there in Roma and then we came back from the meeting.  On the Saturday.   On Monday we went to a meeting at 8th Avenue.  We could not because the meeting was disturbed by policemen.  On Tuesday on my way from back we decided to go and check the car at Roma where he had left it.  Whilst we were there these people appeared singing from the police station.  They had blue shirts and navy blue pants.  Their shirts were hanging loose.  They were just\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 MALAKOANE\nsinging down the street.  I was standing next to the gate, next to the lady who was carrying a baby at her back.  The first person I saw was Mtebi.  He said I know you, get away from that gate because we are going to cause some damage today.  We left there.  They went past Selbourne.  We wanted to go to the offices to go and inform Mayekiso and Buya but we couldn't get there because whilst we were at 6th Avenue there was a boy that already been shot.  His name was Colin.  He was shot on 7th Avenue but he fell on 6th Avenue.  We couldn't go home.  We went at number 31.  When we got there it was dark.  We went to Edith's house but even there people told us that they were already sleeping because it was unpleasant outside.  We went back home.  Before we got home he went into one of the houses to check his friends.  I went to buy him some beers in the neighbourhood.  He found me already in the house.  As we were sitting I gave him a beer and a glass but he didn't use the glass.  I asked him why.  He said no I want to drink quickly using the bottle.  We just heard them singing outside.  When we peeped through the window we thought that maybe they will come through the circle going to Selbourne.  Ace went outside to find out what is happening.  When I followed him, I met him, he said he was already shot.  They damaged our courtyard, they surrounded the house.  He was holding his left when he came in, he said they shot him.  He couldn't say anything.  That was the last time he said anything.  When they got in they asked me where Ace is.  They surrounded the house and they started shooting.  I don't know how I got injured.  Secondly they dragged me outside. Whilst they were dragging me out some of them went outside, I can't recall what happened inside the house but I just saw the house was on fire and\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 MALAKOANE\nthe deceased was inside the house.  They asked me where was I staying, I told them I am staying at the hostel.  They said I must go back to the hostel but before I got there they were beating me with anything they had with them.  They said I must sit down, they said that do you see the house is on fire.  We want you to take out the minute book and his gun.  I said I don't know these things you are talking about because during that day on my way I went to work, he is the one who is at home, he is not working.  I don't know what he does during the day.  I am not aware of any of these things that you are talking about.   And there from one of them said come behind my back and run away.  I don't know how I ran away.  I was bleeding.  My head was bleeding.  After a while when it was quiet I stood up and I saw a Casper with white policemen.  They asked whether is this Ace's house and somebody said yes.  One of them answered and said yes.  I waited for them to leave because I was frightened.  I went to the very same house where I bought beers.  The owner of the house called me in.  I had only one shoe, I lost the one shoe.  When I got there the owner of the house asked whether should I get transport for you to be taken to the clinic, I said no I am scared, they might come and finish me off at the clinic.  He said okay I will give you a combi to take you to the hostel.  I didn't realise how injured I was.  I was just bleeding.  The following day, because I didn't have clothes, the people, my co-residents here in the block helped me with clothes because I was intending to go to work.  I didn't realise that I was injured.  On my way out of the gate, it was round about half past four, these white policemen started shooting again and therefore we retreated.  I never managed to go to work on that day.  These ladies\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 MALAKOANE\nthat I was residing with helped me.  They washed me.  They realised that I was shot in my body.  They came with the reporters who came to take down some statements and from there on they took me to the doctor and my doctor said that he is scared to open, it was ten o'clock in the morning, but they told him that this person was injured.  He did open but he said there is nothing that I can do, there is a bullet embedded in your body.  I can just give you a reference letter to take you to Alex City and there they transferred me to GP straight.  It was on a Wednesday and there they told me that I was injured and because this bullet is embedded in your bones we cannot be able to remove it, you will have to live with it.  They only managed to extract it on the 2nd September in that year.  In that September that year, whilst at work - the following Thursday I managed to go to work but they turned us away not to go to work.  We used the Vasco Da Gama route.  We couldn't go through the township.  I got a lift that took me home and there Mike was already there at Khotso House and they called my employer at work to tell them that somebody will come and collect me.  Yes, I was collected from work.  All the people that I knew that used to work hand in hand were there.  From there on, from Khotso House we tried to make funeral arrangements.  Everything was burnt down.  They gave me a cheque for R500 to try and help me with clothes and I shared it with his brother because he was not working at that moment.  They were buried after four weeks.  In that very same month, after they had been buried in September, whilst I was at work, two policemen arrived.  White policemen.  I remembered the one,  he said his name was Lieutenant Kemp.  He said he is coming to take down a statement.  As I was giving him the\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 MALAKOANE\nstatement I had this pain from this - I suffered from pain due to this bullet and then in this building they took me to a doctor.  They took me to that doctor and left these policemen and when we came back from the doctor I continued with giving them the statement and they left.  After having undergone the operation they called the hostel superintendent saying that he must come and call me, I couldn't go because I was confined to bed for ten days.  As time went by I went to remove the stitches.  They called me again at the office and they delivered a letter that was summonsing me to appear in court.  I went with my brother to court.  I think it was the magistrate's court - I don't remember clearly - in Randburg, where they asked me several questions.  They wanted to know what makes me so certain that these were policemen.  I told them the first one was Mtebi, the second one was John.  Then they asked me where was John residing.  I said he is staying in 3rd Avenue but I don't know his house number.  They wanted to know whether I know his surname, I said no I don't.  That was the last time I appeared in court.  That was the end of the story.",
