Today is also one of those difficult days in Alexandra when people will be reminded of the time in the eighties when the community decided to get rid of inappropriate leaders and that led to civil conflict between the police and community leaders who were trying to set up alternative structures to provide leadership within the community and we hope people will be coming before us who will assist not only us but the community of Alexandra as well to get a clear picture of where you are coming from.  Before you give your testimony as it is the tradition I would like you to stand up so as to take an oath before this Commission.",

            "The year was 1988 and the month was December.  It was a hot day and on that day we had been released from Johannesburg Diepkloof prison known as Sun City.  It was the five of us, Mr Moses Mayegiso, Mr Richard Mdagani, Mr Paul Shabalala, Mr Mzonela Mayegiso and myself where we had been charged with high treason, sedition and subversion for activities around the six days war in Alexandra.  On the day we were jubilant, very excited and rearing to go home, a home we last saw in June 1986 when we were detained.  Getting out of prison is very exciting but we had been following events and news about Alexandra whilst in prison.  Some of our colleagues, friends and comrades were killed\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 BAPELA\nduring our incarceration.  Of significance to me was the death of Comrade Jingles Magoti, a very close friend of mine who it was said got killed during the fight which started between members and supporters of Azapo, dubbed as Amazimzim and the UDF members and supporters dubbed as Amavarara or the Tetarist.  So all those things happened whilst we were in prison.  That is the post 1986 era.  The six days war era.  A single shot, it is said, killed him as he was closing the butchery where he worked at 4th Avenue and (indistinct) owned by Mr Jo Manana who himself was also in detention at that time.  We also read about the gruesome killings of some of the people that we knew whilst we were in prison.  People who were slaughtered you know for fighting for their own liberation and the case that came to mind was that of Mandla of 8th Avenue.  I don't know his surname.  Mandla was confronted by a group of youth armed heavily and was killed and beheaded.  The message was clear, don't associate with UDF or you will go the same way.  While this was happening all Alexandra leaders and activists were in prison under the state of emergency and other security laws.  There was no one left absolutely, no one to really give leadership and guidance over the community. The question that came to mind was why detain only one group of activists who belonged to the UDF structures, why leave members and supports of Azapo, why then if you did not know them, even when they were on a killing spree did the intelligence network of the police not detect and arrest them for their deeds.  The question remained unanswered. Maybe we felt concluding the violence was sponsored by the state covet or structures who saw the opportunity to wipe out the congress structures.  While in prison also we read\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 BAPELA\nfrom smuggled newspapers what we used to call mpugani, it is a flea in English, and because we used to smuggle and a flea can just enter anywhere, it can be in prison, it can be anywhere so that is why we said the newspapers was mpugani.  And by the visits by our families we got informed.  We regarded ourselves as lucky or maybe because we were detained because if we were outside we would be victims like Mtlamula Mabilese, Mandla and Jingles Magoti.  We wondered what was to happen to us if we got released on bail.  We also heard and were informed and read about the new state organisations that has taken over in Alexandra called the Joint Management Committee.  JMC's, which were part of the State Security Council.   In Alexandra the JMC's started to operate.  They had sub-committees such as Stratcom which was called Strategic Communication and Security Committee and others.  Among the activities they planned were the so-called (indistinct) Renewal Strategy, led by Mr Steve Bego who was appointed the chief executive officer of Alexandra after the collapse of the Alexandra Town Council under Reverend Sam Buti.  They analysed all the demands of the community of Alexandra such as poor dilapidated housing and sewerage, no untarred streets and at the time only Selbourne Street was tarred.  The electrification of the township, only phase 1 and phase 2 were electrified at that time.  Poor recreational facilities and an end to the bucket system night soil and a better life for all and an end to overcrowding.  At that time there were about 40 people in one yard and the situation has worsened now.  The JMC found grievances to be legitimate and those grievances were first highlighted by us but still continued to charge me and my colleagues with treason, subversion and sedition for\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 BAPELA\nhighlighting those demands.  A strategy by JMC was developed to electrify Alexandra and instal sewerage system that ended the bucket system and that was done during the period when we were in detention and in prison.  The houses were built in the East Bank but only for affluent people.  Rooftops of Alexandra were painted to look nice, tarring of the streets of Alexandra started and the government gave about R90 million to kickstart the project.  All this took place when we were in prison.  The other strategy was to continue the violence between our organisations, the Congress movement and organisations and Azapo.  At the same time there were  weekly pamphlets distributed by the South African Defence Force which was a member of the JMC's together with SAP, the Alexandra Town Council and other structures that they were able to co-opt.  The pamphleteering and communications strategy was call WAM, which stands for Winning the Hearts and Minds of the People.  Pamphlets will ridicule the comrades as animals in the zoo or as monkeys who thought were cleverer than human beings.  The comrades were described here as monkeys and the South African government as human beings who were so concerned about the needs of the people and who were building nice houses for them.  They prided themselves as the JMC that within a year of our arrest Alexandra was peaceful so-called and that the law and order was now the norm and there was no more intimidation.  That people can go freely to work and children can go to school without fear.  The army started playing soccer and other games with the school children and the youth.  They carried food, fruits, sweets with them in the army tanks and Caspers to give to the youths and then portray a picture of how nice they were as compared to the comrades.  Youth clubs\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n6 BAPELA\nwere established by the JMC's, religious choirs were also established and the target was the young people and they started to mushroom all over Alexandra.  The youth was organised through their clubs to camps to be indoctrinated by the army and the JMC's and the airforce was to win their hearts and minds.   The strategy worked.  All of a sudden there were clubs calling themselves Lapoloa named after one of the TV programmes but their strategy was weak for it could not stop the peoples' march to freedom, hence the nineties saw the rise of the might of our people as they gave a final blow to apartheid.  Religious choirs continue to exist today but no longer under the programme of the JMC's and their dirty games.  It was the Alexandra we read about as we left the prison, the five of us, still leaving thousands of our comrades behind under the state of emergency.  We were not coming home to Alexandra unfortunately.  One of the bail conditions was that we should not visit or enter Alexandra, not to reside there, never to set our feet in Alexandra.  We had to comply with the bail condition.  On the same December period other detainees were released to go back to Alexandra.  Amongst them was my wife Constance but they were released under severe conditions also, confined to their houses from dusk to dawn, reporting to the police station twice a day, morning and evening before six o'clock p.m. being monitored and police used to come and check them at their homes.  The five of us who were still on trial were also given similar conditions to report twice a day at the Hillbrow police station.  Being monitored not to go to Alexandra so we did not take the risk for we didn't want to lose our bail privileges.  I stayed with my lawyer from Cheadle Thompson\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n7 BAPELA\nand Haysom, Mr Norman Manrame and his brother Erwin from the Weekly Mail at that time at number 144 Baker Street, Bellevue East just after Yeoville.  I travelled twice a day to Hillbrow police station to enter my signature that I have not yet absconded on my bail.  I started acclimatising myself to my new temporary home and we were scattered.  Richard and Mzonela were staying with some students of Wits in Bertrams next to Ellis Park.  Moses Mayegiso the wife had organised a flat somewhere in Hillbrow High Point and Paul Tshabalala also stayed with some friends organised by our lawyer.  I was looking forward to a Christmas outside prison.  The last Christmas outside was in 1985. Constance will sometimes visit me for I could not visit her.  At least she was able to leave Alexandra but she had to be back before six o'clock to comply with her release conditions.  On this fateful night of January 6, 1989 I had said in 1988 on the statement but the correct date is January 6, 1989 I had requested Constance to go and sign and come and sleep over as it was past Christmas and new year the police may not check them and as they were doing frequently.  Besides the owner of the house had gone on a holiday and I was alone, all by myself and there was a helper living in the servants quarters at the back with her husband and their son Aubrey who was just ten years old and had come for holidays from the rurals.  The incident happened on January 6, 1989 and the case number as was reported is 39/01/89.  And it was opened at the Yeoville police station.  In the evening of the 5th January we cooked, watched TV up to very late, I think until around 12 midnight and Aubrey was in the house with us.  Constance was already expecting at that time.  As it was already late we organised for Aubrey to\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n8 BAPELA\nsleep in the main house and we all went to bed tired and slept.  It must have been around three in the morning on the 6th January when the incident occurred.  I was first asleep, we were fast asleep, we didn't hear anything.  According to neighbours and the parents to Aubrey there was a heavy explosion which reverberated through the quiet suburb and one of the neighbours, a white woman, heard soon after the blast the screeching of the car tyres, which indicates a car was pulling away at high speed, which may have been used by the attackers.  People apparently started to scream to extinguish the fire which has caught the house, shouting at us to wake up and open as the house was burning.  It must have taken then about five minutes shouting, even breaking the windows before a response from us.  When I woke up I heard a lot of voices screaming, shouting and calling Aubrey's name.  I think it was his mother.  At first when I heard I thought we have been attacked by the criminals but when I clearly woke up I heard the house is on fire.  I immediately responded and then that we were waking up.  I woke Connie and went to wake up Aubrey as well and the nightmare began.  I didn't know where I had put the key.  The house windows and doors were burglared with heavy steel and in the dining room wall, which had the main door leading to the street, it was filled with smoke and some items were still burning at the time.  I should think the key was at the door, the front door and wanted to reach it to open. I was choked and blinded by the smoke and each time I went to the dining room wall the flames were coming towards me and I would retreat.  It must have been during the third attempt when I said I do it or we all die here.  I forced myself with my eyes blinded by the smoke, I could\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n9 BAPELA\nnot breathe because I was choked by smoke but I had taken a deep breath which enabled me to move until I reached the door and fortunately the flames did not catch my clothes.  I reached for the key and opened the door and gave the key to those outside to open the grille as I tried to breathe the fresh air.  Soon after the grille flung open Connie and Aubrey were fetched from inside the house by others and then others also started moving in with buckets full of water to extinguish the flames.  We were all laid on the grass ... (nothing further on tape) ... I should think it was a fire bomb which was used for it only shattered the windows and started burning.  There were no cracks on the wall.  We stayed outside until sunrise and private clothed police came, took my details and I was later taken to Yeoville police station for a statement.  That was the last time I had contact with the police and have never heard anything to date about the incident from them.  What provoked me to come and give the evidence was the evidence which was given at the Johannesburg City Council Commission in 1990 referred to Hiemstra Commission in 1990 at which a witness gave evidence to the effect that he was given a task by the Johannesburg City Council security to attack houses in Johannesburg and he was paid for that.  Housing plans of Johannesburg Democratic Action Committee members were released by the Johannesburg City Council to this group, which included the house of Norman Manrame and his brother Erwin and that is the house where I stayed. The witness was unsure whether among the houses that he attacked personally it included the Manrame's house.  Further information can be obtained from Brigadier Snowball who was investigating the matter of the CCB covet operations which were conducted from\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n10 BAPELA\nthe Johannesburg City Council offices.  Again this year during May/June the former security policeman from the John Vorster Square, Warrant Officer Paul Erasmus, in one of his many interviews to the media has spoken about a spate of attacks which included an attack in Bellevue East house where he says they had information that there was a terrorist staying there.  What Warrant Officer Erasmus was saying is not new about the incident.  After the event in 1990 the police said they had information that the house was apparently attacked because there was a terrorist staying there.  This was police information released in 1990.  What is not clear from Warrant Officer Erasmus' statement is whether he was part of the group that attacked and which house exactly was attacked in that location of Bellevue East, Yeoville or Observatory because those township suburbs are close to each other, whether it was at 144 Baker Street.  The consequences of the bomb attack were that due to Connie's pregnancy she was shocked and was also choked by the smoke for the ten minutes after waking up. She was more frightened for she was not supposed to have been there and the police were going to find out.  I had to protect her at that time.  When I was interviewed by the media I said I was alone with Aubrey in the house, so I didn't mention her name.  But today one can say she was in the house at that time.  She became nervous, had psychological effects and was treated for shock by Dr Fazel Randera and referred to the psychologist by him for further treatment. The trial was still going on and one was concentrated on it.  In April 1989 we were all acquitted of treason, sedition and subversion and for the first time we were able to come home to Alexandra.  A son was born and although now seven years\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n11 BAPELA\nold he has learning deficiency but he is at a normal school and we fully suspect it was the effects his mother had suffered.  What I want to know is who did it, why they did it and also what I want to know whether I was that terrorist who was staying in that house and what I want to know from the police is when receiving information that there was a terrorist staying there why didn't they verify because they knew that I was staying there because when we left prison they wanted us to give physical addresses of where we were going to be staying as part of the bail conditions and we did provide those addresses and I was staying there. Or maybe the attack was aimed at Norman Manrame who was a human rights lawyer.  Or maybe because Norman was once active in Jodac, Johannesburg Democratic Action Committee before taking full time employment with Cheadle Thompson and Haysom as a lawyer.  Or maybe because his brother Erwin Monrame was a co-editor of the then Weekly Mail which is now Weekly and Guardian with Anton Harper. These are the questions which remain unanswered today.  And I think that is how far I can go in as far as the incident of the attack in that house is concerned.",

            "The events that led to the six days war started in 1985, around June I think, when a lot of townships in South Africa were aflame.  There was a lot of activity and uprisings in most of the townships at that time and Eastern Cape was leading at that period I am mentioning and this sort of inspired a lot of other townships in the belief that the activities in the Eastern Cape reminded them of the M plan, the Mandela plan which was known in the 1950's and then people wanted really to also begin a process of establishing those structures of the street committees, the block committees and the yard committees within their own areas, within their own townships and also in the Transvaal, the then Transvaal, the main activities was the start of the rent boycotts were started in the Vaal, Sebokeng and Sharpeville townships and then it spread to Soweto and also Alexandra then came into the picture during 1986.  And also during 1995 there was the consumer boycott which was organised and then the Transvaal had its own committee, the Transvaal anti consumer boycott which operated and then those activities really also were happening in Alexandra\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n13 BAPELA\nwhere people were stopped from buying from white shops and then only to buy in the black shops.  So those then are the events then that built on the mobilisation which was there in Alexandra and around January there were shootings that occurred at shops which are Third Avenue and London Street and then I don't know what provoked the incident but what we read was that the security guard who was employed there shot at some youths who were coming to buy or were playing around at that particular area.

At that time he was a pupil at Alexandra High School and then during the weekend on which he was buried, which was the weekend of the 15th February, the funeral took place at the Alexandra stadium and then after the funeral they wanted his parents to go and wash their hands and also be provided with whatever and the police came and tear-gassed people at that funeral and that provoked the youth of our township really then to mobilise and then attacks you know started where police became the targets and then Alexandra then was in flames for a period of six days and that is why we lost about 19 people during that particular period in time but then my colleague has prepared extensively on that period, Mr Bennet Lekalakala and I think\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n14 BAPELA\nhe will dwell much into the events and other incidents that took place during that particular period in time.",

So we then started sharing the idea with other comrades in Alexandra about you know having to start in Alexandra establishing street committees so that people can take their own destiny into their own hands and then show that they are able then to live as human beings and as a community sharing and then the sorrows and sharing the joy you know together as a community. So the discussion started around November/December for such an idea of the street committees and then a group of us then was mandated to begin discussions with the Alexandra Civic Association, which was led by Mr Mike Bia to say why don't you build a strong organisation, a mass based organisation and this is the format and thus how we need to do it where you move from area to area, street to street, yard to yard and then begin to establish these committees.  Explain to the people first and then thereafter the people will appoint their own committees and so forth.  And a structure was then you know put together as to how should the structure look like and\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n15 BAPELA\nhow many members should be serving in a committee.  And those discussions did not bear any fruits unfortunately and then when we realised that the Alexandra Civic Association did not want really to adopt that structure and to start building its organisation on it.  We then approached Mr Moses Mayegiso who was a leading trade unionist known within the country, a member of Numsa and then to say can you be the leader of this new organisation.  That will then be structured along the street committees and so forth.  And after some series of discussion by those comrades who were mandated, unfortunately I was not part of them because at that time the police were looking for me for a trial in Cradock so I had to be very careful.  I used to come in during the night in Alexandra and speak to the comrades and leave and they would do the rest of the work and then go on hiding.  And so they managed therefore to convince comrade Moses Mayegiso and he accepted and then a series of meetings between the students organisation, the Alexandra Youth Congress at that time started with Moses and the others to meet with the people in their yards, called committee meetings where they will explain the structure and then people would go back, discuss and then begin to establish democratically those structures and then elected people democratically to serve them.  And then this sort of really spread throughout the township and then it was at that time when the people were moving from street to street when the incident at the funeral of Michael Durari and Alexandra was engulfed into a six days war.",

            "Yes, the whole idea of a peoples court I think it started in around 1985 by the youth who were continuously mobilising each other around the consumer boycott.  So what happened in Alexandra during that also was that the youth then formed themselves into anti-crime patrol groups, moving from one shebeen to the other, telling the youth not to be drinking in the shebeens and whenever they found youths they would then take them out and tell them to go home and if you are a student they would tell you go and study so that you study and pass and as a result crime came to zero in Alexandra.  The type of funerals that took place ever since were the people who died because of natural causes.  There were no longer such deaths caused by fights and stabbings or gun shootings and so and it worked, that anti-crime campaign and then whenever they found knives or weapons on the individuals they would take them away from them into one centre where they would then destroy them and so, so it worked and as a result of that then people began to have confidence in the youths for this very good wonderful work and they started bringing problems to the youths to say I have got a problem with my neighbour or I have got a problem with my next door kin or I have got a problem with my wife and so forth, so forth.  All sorts of cases that had now flocked into the youth and obviously they were quite selective, they were only looking for those violent type of cases and then they would start putting the complainant and then the perpetrator together and say can we talk amongst ourselves really and resolve this matter amicably.  And then peacefully and go back and stay together as neighbours or as friends and so forth.  So it was more to give advice than\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n17 BAPELA\nreally to prosecute or to sentence people.  So it sort of spread throughout Alexandra wherever there was a group of youths that would go out on an anti-crime then the residents would go to them to say we need your assistance and so forth and they did the work quite excellently and without any sjambokings and sentences.  But unfortunately as time went around after the six days war when now everyone was angry, it was the deaths and Alexandra was unsettled and some of the youths got excited unfortunately and when people were brought instead of resolving those problems according to what they have been doing they started trialling people and prosecuting them and in some instances then they would sentence them to sjambokings and so forth, so forth.  So it then became a norm in those peoples courts and those were the part of the activities and when we were arrested obviously amongst the charges under sedition and subversion  was that we had run those courts but the intention there from the State was that we have taken over the justice administration, which is the function of the South African government and was now in the hands of the people and therefore we were therefore furthering the aims of the ANC and the South African Communist Party, that of overthrowing the State and replacing it with the organs of peoples power which were in operation at that time and hence then they were charging us with that.  There was no evidence that said I myself did sjambok anybody or any of the accused did sjambok anybody but they just took all those things and then put them on us because when you are on treason it is everything that was done and whether you are there or you are not there or at a given point you are in prison but when charges are formulated you find yourself in that situation. \nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n18 BAPELA",

            "Yes, during that period I think it was the strategy of the South African police to identify a group of people that they can infiltrate and use against our own organisations and our own people, our own comrades and Alexandra did not escape that and maybe just to start by\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n19 BAPELA\nsaying that in April when they could not find anybody or any gangster or any grouping in Alexandra that they can use against ourselves they themselves as the South African Police went into Alexandra and attacked the community under the disguise that they were Amagawas.  At that time in Soweto there was a group called - a gangster called Ama Cabasa and it used to terrorise members of the Cosas, Congress of South African Students and students in general in the schools of Soweto.  It was quite a fearful type of a gangster which used to kill.  And so the police then fashioned themselves along the activities of those Ama Cabasas, pretended to be a Ama Cabasa because they used to wear cloths on their heads when they went on a mission of attacking.  So they put those cloths on their heads, but then they had their uniforms on, the blue shirts and their navy blue trousers, but their blue shirts were not inside their trousers, they just pulled them out so that they pretended to be that group of Ama Cabasas who were on an attack.  And from the direction that they came from is the Wynberg police station and then entered Alexandra, attacked all those targeted areas and they attacked all those areas where it was places of our meetings where in some instances it was our own people, our own leaders who stayed in those places and attacked during that night.  And when they left Alexandra they retreated back to Wynberg police station and I think if the reconciliation has to work in Alexandra that incident really has to be spoken in the Truth Commission and one of them really should come forward and say we did it and we understand why they did it because at that time in Alexandra it was a no go area for police.  All policemen who stayed in Alexandra had fled Alexandra at that time of the\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n20 BAPELA\nsix days war because they became the targets and Tebi was one who stayed in Alexandra, had to leave Alexandra under escorts and so.  And also there was a campaign you know that was there to isolate the police campaign.  Socially to isolate them, they should not drink in our shebeens, they should not fall in love with our women and no woman should be in love with a police.  This was the serious campaigns that were there and they were rejected completely by then and I think it aggrieved them that they have to flee their own homes, they have been rejected, they can't fall in love with women in Alexandra, they can't drink in Alexandra, they can't buy in any shop in Alexandra because that was how far they went to the extent and hence their attack and I think if they can really come forward and say we did it and we are sorry for what we did I think the community will be very happy.  And just in June before the state of emergency was declared the incident that provoked the Azapo UDF fight was a meeting of the Alexandra Youth Congress in Dagani camp which was held at the church at 9th Avenue between Selbourne and the other street, I just forgot the name, I think it is John Brandt.  So that meeting was there, I think it is number 45 or 41, that church.  The meeting was held there, the church was full and then when a sniper from Azapo came through the window shot and killed Matamola Mbelese and I think that then provoked the incident that it was this group that attacked because some of the people who were outside guarding the meeting, because at that time we used to guard our meetings because police would also come and attack and after having attacked  Alexandra as Ama Cabasa.  So after that incident obviously then it sparked the whole violence between Azapo and (indistinct) and I think as we said that\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n21 BAPELA\nthey were infiltrated, I would fully agree that yes they were infiltrated because not everybody who was Azapo was in that particular mood of fighting and so forth.",

            "Yes, my addition is that there are five policemen who really owe an apology, who owe information to the community of Alexandra.  That is Captain van Hysten who is still active in the police services up to now, Sergeant Alex - I just forgot his name but a very notorious police who killed a lot of our own people, including Michel Kukunene.  Sergeant Mtebi who was very instrumental during the 1976 killings, who is now a preacher, a repentant person, a person who is now a community activist, who can stand up and shout Amandla today.  If he can really come back to Alexandra from where he is residing, Spreadview, to come and really tell the committee of Alexandra what really happened and apologise and tell them that he is repentant and that he is one of them, he is now a comrade.  Also Zele who was instrumental to the killing of Vincent Tshabalala and the harassment of the committee of Alexandra, particularly activists.  And also Magade who was deployed at the Brixton Murder and Robbery Squad.  And one former police of the peri-urban police Sindani who was responsible for the death of his neighbour, Meisie Tshabalala, at 14th Avenue during the six days war.  If really this can really come forward and say the community of Alexandra embrace us, we are with you and then we were involved in a struggle and then we defended the wrong system unfortunately and give us an apology, I think the community will really greatly welcome them.  Number two is the incident I have already\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n22 BAPELA\ndescribed of the Ama Cabasa attack.  We want information, we want to know what really happened on that day.  April 1986.  Thirdly is that a befitting honour to be given to all our heros and heroines in Alexandra who paid the ultimate price, whose blood nourished the tree of our liberation.  As we celebrate the 85th anniversary next year of Alexandra I think it would be a befitting honour if we could really give them that particular honour by creating tombstones for them or one big tombstone for all those fallen victims.  And lastly to the government of South Africa to declare Alexandra as a presidential project in honour of its people who are still alive today, who have carried the flag of freedom all these years since 1912 when Alexandra came into being, who remained an inspiration to all other towns, cities, rurals and other areas and who had sacrificed for the struggle of liberation in South Africa.

The first one I would like to know were there cultural or political reasons why your wife didn't make a statement so as to begin the process of healing as well by breaking the silence publicly as to what happened to her while she was pregnant.  For us as a Truth Commission that is critical.  I am surprised Yasmin Sooka\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n26 BAPELA\ndidn't raise that since she has been charged by the Commission to facilitate gender specific hearings and we have already had one in Kwa-Zulu Natal.  The second question it relates to what you referred to as the just war.  It is a big problem for us as a Commission because we have numerous witnesses who have made statements to the effect that their rights were violated, their beloved ones were killed in some instances by the people who were in charge of the peoples courts.  So as you were saying you feel proud that you did that and this is why we are benefitting today, I was conscious of those people who on a daily basis are deeply hurt and saying they won't heal till such time that people who set up those structures come forward and publicly apologise so my question to you is do you think in the process of a just war so many things went wrong especially around the peoples courts?",

            "Maybe to deal with the first question.  I am a gender activist myself, there are no cultural or traditional custom rules that prohibited Constance to give a statement but then she wanted to give her own statement during the women hearings of what she suffered.  I mean she has been in detention as many times as one can no longer count.  She was one of those people who was in custody the longest amongst the women in Gauteng I think.  People were just coming and going and she just stayed there in the state of emergency and she just wanted to talk about those issues and then I think when the women hearings takes place in Gauteng she will be amongst those who will be giving a testimony there.  On the second question I must say that in the conduct of the struggle it is true that there were things that went wrong in many instances but then the wrongs were not planned by\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n27 BAPELA\nthe organisation, the wrongs were not planned by the leaders and therefore those wrongs when they occurred people had to come in and say stop it.  In some instances we did succeed, in some incidences we did not succeed, where people tell you who you are and they just continued with those particular activities.  And that was the situation unfortunately where in some areas we could not really give maximum control on.  And then just to be specific on occurrences on the peoples courts, the peoples courts were set not by us as leaders, not by us as organisations but it was the residents who demanded them by frequently going to the youth and say may I solve your problem now and (indistinct) until we are solved.  Those were the incidences when we went deeper, as we were preparing for their cases too but how they came in to being because all of a sudden we were charged with these peoples courts.  We then got this other information that people demanded and wanted them and because they found solace in them.  But the unfortunate as I earlier indicated, was that some people got excited after the events of the six days war.  Alexandra changed completely.  There was complete anger that dominated Alexandra then but a period prior to there was that very good organisational control over the situation and unfortunately the deaths and the massacres that then followed really worsened the situations and one will not therefore say that everything that was done thereafter could be justified as just because the wrongs you know did occur unfortunately but not because they were planned or mastered by certain organisations or leaders.",
