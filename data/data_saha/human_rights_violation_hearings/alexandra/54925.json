Her next door neighbour, Agnes Nagema, told her that she is wasting her time because if the Inkatha start, they will start at their place.  It happened that people came to the house, they were holding firearms.  They asked them to stand on the line and one of them said these people are not complete here and truly they were not all there because my sister was bathing and also the elder daughter was not around.  When my sister came out of the bathroom and entered the house, they started shooting and she was hit by two bullets.\n She was taken to a clinic.  While she was in the clinic they transferred her to Tembisa Hospital.  She stayed there from the day she was admitted and she was never treated.  When we arrived in the hospital we found that her bed was \nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 M MKHUANAZI\nfull of blood and she was also oozing saliva from her mouth.  We tried to ask for a transfer so that they can take her to Karaphong Hospital.  They transferred her the second day.  The bullet which entered on her chin, they could not extract it and it happened to move back to her neck and it killed her.\n Later we went to the ANC offices.  We took some members of the ANC together with us.  We went to the hospital and we discovered that she was dead.  We took her to a mortuary.",

            "Yes, I can.  When we arrived in hospital we find that she was covered with blood on her face.  We took her to the undertaker nearby and we started preparing for the funeral.  On the 26th of March there was a curfew in the location and because of this people were not allowed to travel or walk around after nine o' clock.  If you were found in the streets after nine you were arrested.  So people came to the night vigil and also some friends came.  We decided not to have a night vigil because it was late and it was about nine o' clock.  People decided to stay because they were afraid to walk in the streets after nine.  So they sat in the tent.\n There were some young boys outside and they saw a young woman in the company of a young man wearing a cloth on her head.  They started running away because they were thinking those were Inkatha members coming to attack them.  People who were in the tent started running into the house.  The lady who has just finished her testimony now tried to call the police.  The police came and they told us we do not have to worry because they would protect us.  We told them that \nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 M MKHUANAZI\nwe are afraid because my sister was shot by Inkatha people so we needed to be protected.  They promised us that they will be riding around turning on their sirens and people are afraid to come and attack us.  We asked them to stand at the gate and protect us.  They said we must not worry, they will be riding up and down the street.  They passed the first time and the second time and the siren was ringing.  We started preparing tea for the people at the night vigil.  \n The Xhosa children started singing their songs, freedom songs.  Since it was a night vigil they were singing Church songs, but after twelve they started singing freedom songs.  As the police were passing they could hear them singing these freedom songs.  After a few minutes, it was at about three in the morning, a crowd of people came towards our place.  As our home was opposite to the clinic, they were coming from the clinic towards our place.  So the young children who were singing ran into the house.  One of them decided to go back home, but unfortunately when he see this crowd of people coming, he ran and came back to us to tell us there are some people coming towards our place.  My brother ran outside behind the houses.  By that time the people had already arrived and they knocked at the door asking us to open.  We refused to open and they insisted that if we do not open, they are going to break the door.",

They were clad in police uniform and they were also wearing some balaclavas.  When they entered the house they started shooting.  We did not\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 M MKHUANAZI\nbring the body and we arranged that the body should be brought the next day.  They entered the house and shot at everybody inside.  They shot my sister's children and all the people in the house.  We were taken to hospital.  At the time we were in the hospital, some died on the way to hospital.  Some managed to arrive at hospitals and some of my sister's sons friends died during the incident. \n We made a statement to the police.  We were able to explain that we saw them and even the manner in which they were dressed.  They took us to hospital.  We were treated and after that we were taken to identify the perpetrators and we managed to identify them on a parade.  They also found the guns that were used and also the bullets that were used.  Cartridges were also take for ballistic proof.  What surprises me the most is that these people were found not guilty.  They kill us without a reason and I would like to ask the Commission to investigate and find these people.  Let them come out and tell us exactly why they shot us.  Even on the day on which they were released we were not told, we just saw that they were released on papers.  The case ended like that.  \n We were so badly injured and we would also be happy if those who died can be honoured by erecting tombstones on their graves.  Thank you.",

As now it comes out that there were some people behind this violence.  Now the truth is coming out that there were people who wanted the black people to kill each other.  As we have witnessed one of the cases in this incident.  We will try and investigate as to why this happened and also in relation to the case we will try and find out as to why the police did not protect you when you asked them to protect you.  They left you open for attack.  We will also try to investigate as to how your trial was conducted and also why they promised you to hold the trial in camera and later they did not.  However, these things\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n10 M MKHUANAZI\nwill never bring back the deceased.  However, the truth will come out and heal our wounds so that when the time comes for us to reconcile, we can reconcile with open hands and open hearts.  We will also ask as to how does it happen that people who can be chased from their homes and not allowed or forcible removed, you are not allowed to go back and stay there.\n As we know very well that people in Alexandra live peacefully.  Also like to find out if possible can they go back to that peaceful situation or peaceful environment where people are reconciled and happy.",

However, when the shooting started it took about ten minutes for them to arrive.  They should have heard the sounds of an AK47 because it was very loud.  I wonder if they did not hear the sound of the gun.",
