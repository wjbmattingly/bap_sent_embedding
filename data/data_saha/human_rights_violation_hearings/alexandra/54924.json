            "My name is Dora, I am residing at number 1, 18th Avenue.  The deceased is my son Jabulane Mkhele.  He was staying at 9th Avenue, house number 10 at my brother's place.  One day he woke up in the morning and went to work in town.  He was together with his brother.  He wasn't able to reach the bus stop as we were using buses at that time.  Before he reached the bus stop he came across white policemen at 12th Avenue and he was shot by these white people.  These were the SAP members.  There were four of them.  Three of them ran away and climbed on top of a tree.  Some of them ran into some shacks.  Those that were in the\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 MKHELE\ntop of a tree they were shot at until they had to fall on the ground and therefore they followed those who ran to a shack.  They collected all of them, they pulled them on the street.  While they have pulled them on the street one lady by the name of Zuzekele called an ambulance.  The ambulance arrived.  When it arrived the boers refused the ambulance to come near the place of the incidents and then they finished the children by shooting at them.  I heard the following morning, because my brother realised that Jabulani didn't come back from work and he started to worry and he asked him what had happened.  Therefore that following morning we woke up early in the morning to find out at his work place and was told that he didn't report for work.  Therefore my brother went straight to the government mortuary and he found his body.  He came back to tell me the message at 18th Avenue number 1.   After giving me the message I could feel it in my blood that in that morning that something wrong had happened because on that appointed day I saw the boers shooting at people climbing on top of a tree.  I didn't think my son was involved because he was afraid of the whites.  Unfortunately that was the day on which he was shot.  I could feel that there was something wrong so I walked up in the morning to 15th Avenue to see my daughter was schooling there.  It was a Monday and children were chased away from school and beaten.  Unfortunately we were going to the other side, I was leaving behind my son who got shot and I could feel it, my mouth was shaking.  I took my daughter back home because I couldn't hold anything so that they can help me with the housework.  There was this big ambulance which was going around the township calling people to come forward to identify the bodies.  After they had to\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 MKHELE\ncall soldiers to cool down the fire.  It became better when they arrived and then they asked the people they are going to come to some company to talk. I didn't go to the meeting because I could feel that something was going to happen.  I will stop there.",
