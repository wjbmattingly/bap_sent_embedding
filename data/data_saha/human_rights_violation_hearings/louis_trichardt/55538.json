There were people at the same time, who had gone to my house.  They broke into the house and went in.  They said to my son's wife we want the old man.  And she was not able to open for them.  They just went away because they knew where I had gone to.  They overheard me speaking on the other side and they kept quiet.\n This youth arrived and said to me Mushari.  You have been called, please go.  And I went out, I could not realise that there were some people outside.  As I went to the gate they were on me.  They were singing some songs and they took me.  They kept on saying, you are a witch, you are a witch, you are a witch, you are depending on witchcraft.  I said, are you referring to me.  They said, yes.  I did not know, I did not recognise anybody there.  \n They took me to another house.  They took my wife at Malima.  We went to another house, belonging to Matilimo's.  They took another old lady.  My son arrived.  They were still singing, the youth were still singing.  I was told, Baba, please do not resist, just go along with them.  \n I agreed to that and I was taken to the chief's kraal.  The chief was around.  There was no other person - I could not recognise anybody because I was so worried.  I was accused of being a witch.  As we were there, these young boys had left.  Now the Police had already arrived by then.  When they arrived they said well we are now leaving.  We want you to escape now.  I resisted, but I was just putting on my vest.  They took me to the van.  Well I was taken to the Police station.   When they left, it was during the time when I had to take statement.  As I said before, I could not recognise any young person there because there were so many of them.  As we were sitting there, my wife brought my jacket and they said your son will be coming.  When my son arrived there was function, and I mean is there a function and I was asked to go there, because the elderly people were not there.  My son said I was going to be taken and then I will go back.  The Police was on guard and some few people and some elderly women.  I went along with them.  We went back home.  \n My son and his brothers were together and then they were busy on the function.  They were asked to tell the story, or relate.  They only said we are only learning from these people that our father is a witch.  We do not know the historical background about his witchcraft.  We have been living with our father for so long, we can only say we can order the old man to go back home.   Well, after the function, on Monday, I was asked to go back to the Police station.  That other son of mine had said he was not going to come back and when reading the paper it was said I was not going to leave.  And it was said there will have to be a coming back the following day.  But unfortunately it was feared that I could be killed there.  My sons came and they took me and that is where I am still at home now.  There was no other trouble since.  That is all I can say.  Thank you.  No more.",
