I felt I'm not brave to remain in the house alone then I ran to my neighbour's house. I found them at the door who were ...(indistinct) people who were just about to run away.\n I went to the back of this group after hiding myself behind them, shots were fired at us.  After they shot they drove away and then we started counting those who were injured, I took one of the parents' children on my back and ran to the hospital.  I was not well dressed, then I went inside my house and got dressed.  When we arrived at one section of the township we went into one house and asked for transport to the hospital.  As we drive past the field we saw this Casper then this man said we must take another road because those people might shoot at us. \n What I remember on our way to the hospital, we were stopped by a police vehicle who asked us where we were TEMBISA  HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 SHILABE\nheaded, and we told them people were shot, we told them we don't know by whom. They said, were AK 47 rifles used, we said we don't know.  They left us then we continued on our route to the hospital. The child to this mother that I was carrying on my back was not allowed to get into the hospital so I took this child because her mother was not allowed in.  Then they took x-rays, she was vomiting blood, we went back home afterwards. We found that Mr Ingwenya had left , he was shot and taken by one man to the hospital, that's when we went back and that's where the whole story ends.",
