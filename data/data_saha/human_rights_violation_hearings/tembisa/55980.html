<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As is usual, I'll ask one of the Commissioners to assist you in your statement, I'll ask Yasmin Sooka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you, Ms Shilabe, are you able to hear me clearly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> Yes I can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Tell me about yourself and how long you've lived in Ivory Park and how many members there are in your family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> I arrived in 1992 at Ivory Park when this incident occurred. Shots were fired at about three o'clock in the morning whilst we were asleep.  I felt I'm not brave to remain in the house alone then I ran to my neighbour's house. I found them at the door who were ...(indistinct) people who were just about to run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a> I went to the back of this group after hiding myself behind them, shots were fired at us.  After they shot they drove away and then we started counting those who were injured, I took one of the parents' children on my back and ran to the hospital.  I was not well dressed, then I went inside my house and got dressed.  When we arrived at one section of the township we went into one house and asked for transport to the hospital.  As we drive past the field we saw this Casper then this man said we must take another road because those people might shoot at us. </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a> What I remember on our way to the hospital, we were stopped by a police vehicle who asked us where we were TEMBISA  HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>2 SHILABE</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>headed, and we told them people were shot, we told them we don't know by whom. They said, were AK 47 rifles used, we said we don't know.  They left us then we continued on our route to the hospital. The child to this mother that I was carrying on my back was not allowed to get into the hospital so I took this child because her mother was not allowed in.  Then they took x-rays, she was vomiting blood, we went back home afterwards. We found that Mr Ingwenya had left , he was shot and taken by one man to the hospital, that's when we went back and that's where the whole story ends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you, I'm going to ask you some questions just to make sure that I'm clear. Did you live next to any of the previous witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> Yes it is so. I stayed with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> And were you staying alone in your shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> Yes I stayed alone in my shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> So you went to seek shelter in the garage as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> Yes it is so. I left my shack and I ran to the garage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> So you also ran with them to the Umfuleni section, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> No I had not yet arrived at the garage when they ran to Umfuleni section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> So you arrived at the shack when they were coming back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> I think so because I found them at the garage.  MS SOOKA:   When there was this attack on the house, were you able to see any of the faces of faces of the men who were shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> I didn't see a thing because I hid myself TEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>3 SHILABE</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>underneath the counter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> So all you saw were the gunshots flying around the room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> Yes it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> And were you at all hurt in this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> I didn't sustain any injuries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> You mentioned that on your way to the hospital you saw a Casper.  Can you tell me what the colour of the Casper was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> It was during the night, however it looked sort of dark green and grey, it was during the night, I couldn't see clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> And the person that you spoke to, was that a policeman or a soldier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> When we left for hospital, it was a policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> You mention also that he told you not to go because you might be shot. Was this a white policeman or a black policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> It was a mixed group, There were white policemen and black policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> What language were they speaking at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They were speaking Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> When you arrived at the hospital you also say that your neighbour was not allowed into the hospital. Why was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> She was carrying a small child on her back,</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>there was a room where we were not allowed with small children inside the hospital.  Then I decided to take the child into the hospital, then she undertook x-rays in the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Did you make any statement to the police after TEMBISA  HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>4 SHILABE</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>this had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> No. (presumed,no translation here)</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> In your statement you also mention that shacks were burning in that area. When did you notice that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> Before they started shooting there were already shacks burning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> When you returned back home, was your shack still standing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> What was your impression of how many people had been hurt and how many shacks had been burning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> I could not explain how many shacks were burned because that was not my section where I saw the shacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> So in your section, no shacks had been burned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> No there were no shacks burned in our section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> In the days that came afterwards, did you speak to anybody else about this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> Except my neighbours, I talked to no one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Had all the sections in Ivory been attacked or was it just a few sections and a few streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> It was about two section which were attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> And only in the one section, shacks had been burned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SHILABE:</span> I cannot clearly tell but where I observed was in one section that shacks were burned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Who did you suspect could these attackers have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> I would be lying, I don't know who attacked us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> How many months have you been living in Ivory TEMBISA  HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a> </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>5 SHILABE</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>Park before this attack took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> I cannot remember but I think it was about six months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Were you involved in any political activity in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> No. I was not ever involved in such activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Did you know your neighbours well before this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> Yes they were known to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We thank you Mrs Shilabe, I will ask some of our commissioners to ask you some questions. Commissioner Joyce Seroke, Commissioner Hugh Lewin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> If I could just ask one question which I asked the other two witnesses, what do you think was happening that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> I do not know because even during the day there was nothing happening.  We heard nothing, when we were asleep during the night we heard gunshots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And in the discussions you've had afterwards, have you come up with any ideas yourselves as to what was happening and why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> I would be lying, I know nothing. I had just arrived in that vicinity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Maybe if I can ask you, is it possible that something like this happened and you as neighbours, you didn't discuss it to a point of being much more helpful to the Commission as to what might have happened, because normally in a residential area, if something like this happens, people talk a lot about what has happened and that TEMBISA  HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>6 SHILABE</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>will help us a lot as Commission if we can share, even speculations or whatever the talk that went around that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> To tell the truth, we never discussed this thing, we were busy treating those who were injured, trying to identify those who were injured or who sustained injuries, so we didn't get a chance to talk about this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yasmin Sooka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> I notice in your statement that you say a relative of yours died in the attack.  Can you tell me who that was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> It was a child of my neighbour, where I ran for shelter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> To your knowledge, had any attack like this taken place before in Ivory Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> It had never occurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> So this the first time there was an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> Yes it was the first time that I have noticed this kind of attack in Ivory Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Had there been trouble between the residents of Ivory Park and any other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS SHILABE:</span> No there has never been any problems with the residents of other factions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Manganye, we welcome you. Even though we have organised that you all sit here at the same time, we will however give each of you -, we will request you to tell us what you remember about what happened at that time as far as you can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MANGANYE:</span> I stayed a bit far from these ladies but my TEMBISA HEARING  TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>7 MANGANYE</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>child had visited my friends here.  Whilst I was sleeping I heard some gun shots I woke up and I opened the door and I realised that there were a lot of lights in the soccer field and I got worried because my child was not at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a> We woke up the following morning and went to the field. When we got there people were lying around there and many people were dead and people were talking to white policemen who were in a Caspar.  I thought maybe it was an accident that happened there.  It was at Umfuleni, but when I went to my sister's house where my child was sleeping, I couldn't find her but this lady was sitting outside her door crying, and I asked where the children are.  She said, she does not know but they're at the hospital, whether they are alive or not, she cannot tell. I started crying as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a> I went back home and I decided to go to the hospital as well, but when we got to the hospital we found that people were injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We thank you.  In your statement you have stipulated a different time from the others as if you had heard about this around about a quarter to three. Can you tell us about when this started and what you heard and when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> I heard some noise of gunshots, it was</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>round about three o'clock, before three o'clock. When I decided to open there were some bright lights in the ground, in the open field as if it was broad daylight but I started to go back in the house, but when we decided to go to the open field, the following morning, we found people who were talking there and there we some people who were lying around who had been injured and some were already taken to hospital. </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The way you explain it, it's as if some TEMBISA  HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>8 MANGANYE</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>people were injured at Umfuleni and some here on the open field, but the others who testified tell us about those who were injured inside the garage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> It means that before I went to the garage, I passed the open field.  That's where dead people were lying around, so I thought this incident only happened in the open field, and then even those who were at Umfuleni, they were already taken to hospital and I found this lady sitting outside the garage and crying.  But before I can reach the garage, I have to pass this open field.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say that you started by the field, we know that it's not an easy thing to try and recall this, but if you can just try and recall, let your memory, in order to help us, more or less what time was it when you got to the ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> It was just before 7 o'clock when I went to the open field, but the gun shots were in the morning before 3 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want you to try and remember as to how many people you saw and just to try and give us a picture in order to help us, because we are trying to find out about things that we never saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> I cannot tell you how many people were there because people were just lying around and I was scared, and as I tried to look further, the policemen chased us away and even other people, because some people were saying that, maybe some of their relatives must be lying here, but I just decided to go to the garage section.  That's where I found that people were injured as well, so I realised that this went as far as Umfuleni and I realised that my child was taken with the people that were in the garage to hospital.</p>

<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know this policeman who said people must move.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> No, I do not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he a black or a white policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> He was a black policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many policemen were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> There were many policemen and some were inside the Caspar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The people who were lying down, were they injured or were they dead already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> They were dead already and some were covered already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I heard that you were scared look ...(indistinct), if you can try and help us and tell us how many people there were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> I didn't see how many people, because even myself, I'm a coward, I just became scared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you tell us whether there were two or three in number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> The person that I saw clearly was the person who was lying on the ground, they shot him and he</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>was facing towards his shack but most of them were just lying on the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You child that you said had visited your sister, how old was your child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> He was five years old at that time but now he is nine years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you found your child, you found the said lady who told you that your child is at hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> And she gave me my child's card and showed me that my child is definitely in hospital.</p>

<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>10 MANGANYE</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you got to hospital, do you remember in what situation your child was in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> I found that my child was shot in the leg and the leg was elevated and my sister's child was also shot as well and the bullet is still embedded in her body but this lady's child was already dead at that time.  We were not allowed to see her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As someone who went into the children's ward, how many children were shot that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> I think and it was my child and my sister's child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After this were there any means by which you tried to get some legal representation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> I tried but I realised that you need finance to get a lawyer, and as I am not working, I could not afford this and I couldn't even fetch my child from hospital because of finance.  I did go to some lawyers in Kempton Park but they needed finance and I didn't even have money for transport, and that's when I gave up.</p>

<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> After all of this happened, were you able to talk to people in Ivory Park to find out what had happened that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> I don't know, all I heard was gun shots, as to what happened, I don't know?  There was no fight during that day, there were no signs of unrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Had there been unrest in Ivory Park before this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> No there was no fighting in Ivory Park before TEMBISA  HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>

<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> What were people saying Mama, after this incident had happened? Who were they saying had attacked, did people think it was the police, who did people think were the attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> After such an incident, people don't keep quiet about this kind of thing.  They usually discuss it amongst themselves, now what were your neighbours saying, who did they think had been the attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> I think nothing about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you Mama.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I would just like to really thank all of you.  Before I do that, Yasmin Sooka has got a question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> I have this question for Mrs Mundau.  Mama can you tell me, do you think this attack took place because perhaps your husband was a member of the community association?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MUNDAU:</span> I don't think that is the case because the people he was leading loved him so much and even after this incident they came to help him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> Elsie, you said you live nearby the ground, you also said that when you woke up in the morning you saw many people lying at the ground, does it mean that this incident started at the ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> I would say in my opinion, that things might have started at the ground.  I wasn't aware that this incident also occurred at the 15th houses because it's next to a river.  I just saw the hippo standing on the open ground.</p>

<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MS MANGANYE:</span> No I didn't hear anything, I just heard the gunshots at about 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will try to request the audience to assist us. If there are any people amongst you who know about such incidences, to come forward and give us any information and if they were affected in any manner to give statements and to give any information relating to these incidences.  As you can see, these women will never be comforted and live happily in the community unless they know what led to this incident. All of us today are struggling for a better future.  These people came forward today because they wish to know why this happened and how did this happen.  Everybody who is listening, including the policemen who were in charge at that time, everybody should come forward to the Commission to reveal whatever they know relating to that specific day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a> We'd like to thank you ladies with your testimony.  We put all of you here at the same time, not that we don't realise that you all suffer from pains differently, but we just brought you together seeing that you are coming to talk about one incident.  But we will try as the Commission to investigate as to what led to the events o f that specific night.  We trust that the community and the policemen will assist us in trying to solve and to reveal the truth as to what led to this incident.  We thank you very much and we know that such incidents were happening all over in all communities, they were just meant to scare people, so that even people who intended to be politically inclined, should be scared.  We thank you very much.</p>

<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> It's my neighbour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We thank you very much and we welcome your neighbour as well.  It is wonderful to see that you support each other in such painful incidents.  As it is a tradition we will ask one of our Commissioners to help you to give your evidence.  Your issue, it's one of the things that were much in question regarding the fight between ANC and IFP. We'll ask the Commissioner to help you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Thank you madam Chair, Mrs Nondlala, please comfortable, you are amongst friends. You are going to tell us about an incident that took place a year before the incident in 1991 involving your son.  If you could in you own time please and in your own words, tell us please what happened, thank you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> It was on a Monday, whilst I was at home.  My son came, who was staying in Vusumuzi, he needed food, he told me that he's very hungry.  I wanted he didn't go to work.  He told me that they had been called to the</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>field.  I asked him what's happening, he said, there's a</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>fight there and he didn't know what the fight was all about.  I asked him who fighting.  He said its us Xhosas, the Zulus and the police. Our weapons are being taken from us but the Zulus' weapons are not being taken. I said to him, if so, go back home then.  He agreed to go back home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a> In the afternoon on the Tuesday two young men came to tell me that Lennox has passed away. I wanted where this TEMBISA  HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>14 NONDLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>happened.  He said at Vusumuzi. I wanted to know what happened?  They said they had gone to collect their clothes, being accompanied by policemen.  I wanted to know how this happened?  They said that he stayed in an upper area and he was going to collect his clothes but he never managed to leave, but the police found him there and they shot him there on that spot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a> Thereafter we went to the police station to try and see if they were there because they were taken by this huge van.  When we got there at the police station we learned that they were taken the very same night to Boksburg.  From the police station we went to the hospital.  When we got to the hospital they told us that they were not there.  We left again for Boksburg Mortuary. When we looked around he was not there.  They told us that there are several mortuaries that we can check.  We went to Kempton Park, he was not there either. </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a> We proceeded then to other mortuaries. I don't remember them well and we didn't find him.  And then we went to Soweto, they told us a few corpses were taken to Soweto but they refused that we should go to Soweto so we came back home.  I've finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Mama, could I just ask some questions, if you</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>could tell us a little bit more because we weren't there and it's difficult to understand how such terrible things could happen? If you could explain, or if you could tell us a little bit about your son. How old was he, what was he doing and why was he actually in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> He was born in 1949.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Then he was staying in the hostel, what was he doing there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>TEMBISA  HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>15 NONDLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> He was staying at Vusumuzi Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> So he wasn't staying at home or in his own home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> He used to visit during weekends. He was staying on his own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Did he have a job, did he have some employment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> Yes he was working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Where was he working, can you tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> He was working for the municipality.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Doing what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> He was working in the dumping area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> So was that common for people who worked for the municipality to stay in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Was he staying there free?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> They were paying rent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Paying rent, okay. But was it usual for there to be Xhosa and Zulu speaking people to be together in one hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Because this then seemed to have been the cause of, or particularly the cause of his death. Do you</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>think that that is the main reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> I do not know the reason for his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> But when he came to you on the Monday and told you that the police had disarmed the Xhosa speaking people.  Does this mean that they were normally armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> They were not armed all the time, they were armed simply because they were called to go to this open field.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And why were they being armed for that event?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> They were armed because the Zulus were armed TEMBISA  HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>16 NONDLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>as well, there at the field.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> So everyone was anticipating that there would be a fight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> When the fights tool place, what did the police do, were there police there and what did they do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> You mean the police?  They were fighting as well.  They were helping the Zulus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> So they were actually taking part in the fight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> Yes they were helping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And where were these police from, do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> I don't know where they were from, but we would see those big things that they drive in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And were there other people that were injured or killed at the same time as your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> Many people were injured on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> How many people were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> I cannot tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And then you tell us this horrible story about looking for your son's body and how you couldn't find it.  Was there ever a report made about the incident, or were you ever asked about it by the police or by anybody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> I never gave any report and even the police never enquired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And nobody ever came to you to offer any information? Did you check up with other mortuaries as to where your son's body might have been kept. You mentioned Boksburg, did you go to others yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> I went from mortuary to mortuary looking for my son's body.</p>

<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> If I could just ask one more question, you mentioned about your son being in the hostel, was he also a member of a political organisation at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> I don't know whether he was a member of any political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Thank you very much Mama, I'm sure that there will be other questions from the other commissioners, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We thank you very much.  We will talk Xhosa because I don't want to remind you of those Zulu men.  I'll ask Joyce Seroke to ask any questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> Mama, you say the Zulus were armed and the others were armed as well. What weapons were they, do you know what kind of weapons they wee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> Are you talking about our group?  They were carrying sticks and, I don't know what the Zulus were but ours had kieries and pipes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> You also say that you went from mortuaries like boksburg, Kempton Park and when you wanted to try to go to Soweto, were you denied or did you give up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NONDLALA:</span> Somebody said we should not go to Soweto because there is trouble there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> Is their no one from your side who said he might still try and go to Soweto and check the mortuary?</p>
