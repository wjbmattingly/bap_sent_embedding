            "In Tembeka where I am staying we had a gang called Toasters in the community, which was harassing the community.  After some time they went to stay in Vusimuzi Hostel with Mr Mduze.  There at the hostel they collaborated with Inkatha.  On 31 July 1993 whilst I was sitting at home in the dining room I heard men talking outside saying wake up men.  Because there were patrols at that time, the comrades were patrolling, trying to protect us against the\nTEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 NGWANDI\nToasters.  It went on, the gunshots and then I became concerned with all these gunshots my husband hasn't arrived back at home from work.  He went to work accompanied by his cousin.\n Whilst I was sitting there I heard somebody in the dining room.  I heard the windows being broken in the dining room and then I thought it's the Toasters again starting to attack people and stealing their belongings as well.  Time went on with all this gunfire going on.  Thereafter all windows were being broken down, the kitchen, the bedrooms as well, then I hid next to the wardrobe.  Then I tried to open a window to see what is happening outside, then I saw some men who were carrying guns.  They were in a Casper.  They were shooting relentlessly.  \n It was round about 8:30 when my cousin arrived and I asked him where is my husband?  He took some time to tell me.  He tried to hide something from me.  Then finally he told me that all this gunfire my husband was shot as well.  Then he left and he said he's going to cover him up with a blanket.\n Whilst he was away I tried to ask him to accompany me so that we can go and fetch him because he saw him.  When he came back round about 11 o'clock he said I must take a wheelbarrow and a blanket so that we must go and fetch my husband.  As we tried to go out we saw a Casper passing through another road facing our house.  Then I suggested that we should go to this Casper and tell them that we are being attacked here in Ntombeka Section.  But before then there were more gunshots and then we went into a nearby house.  These men came back and passed by.  We sat there until two o'clock in the morning and then we decided to go \nTEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 NGWANDI\nback home.\n When we got home at 2 o'clock that morning, at 4 o'clock my aunt's child came and told me that my husband had fallen at a new residence area and he told me exactly how it happened.  \n Thereafter I tried to contact the police so that they should be able to help us.  But when I phoned they gave me a different number to call, Kempton Park, but Kempton Park they referred me to Rabasotho.  We tried further to make a few calls but to find that the phone was engaged until we managed to phone through round about 8 o'clock the following morning.  Thereafter I will tell you what led to this gang being called Toasters.",

One of the things that you say, you said you would like to see the perpetrators come before the people and explain.  It is also a wish that the people like them come before us, work together with us.  As you know people reconcile and get to rest if they know exactly what happened.  We also invite all of them, especially the perpetrators to stand up, come up and explain everything as to what happened, and this is what we think can bring peace within the community.  Thank you.",
