            "On the 1st of May 1986 young men went past the street singing. After some time when they had gone by, I don't remember what time it was, my son left with his younger sister and my neighbour's child saying that they were going to buy some cigarettes.  A policeman came names \"Scarface\" in the Township.  When he appeared, this policeman, he said what are you doing here, I want nobody here, and he pointed a gun at him.  My younger child ran to me and said to me they have shot Vincent.  When I went out the children had already run away when I arrived at this place of this incident.  Scarface wanted to know what am I\nTEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 F MALOSI\ndoing there.  Vincent asked him why did you kill me because I did nothing wrong, and he said are you still alive dog?  And he turned him over and he pointed him in the forehead and that is the finishing bullet.  I asked Scarface why are you killing my son?  He said I am going to shoot you as well.  That's when I decided to run for my life.  \n When I got home a man came who tried to find transport.  He is a neighbour, this gentleman.  He was looking for a blanket.  He covered him with this blanket because he was dead already, because Scarface had already chased me away because he wanted to shoot me.  He wanted to shoot anyone who wanted to come next to that scene.  This happened in my street very near my house.  A Casper arrived and took my child away and my blanket as well.  Till today I never got my blanket back.\n As time went by we were being harassed by tear gas. Black and White policemen used to go and throw some tear gas canisters in the yard.  We were running out of the house crawling for our lives.  On the day when we were arranging for the funeral they came during the night vigil and threw some tear gas in the yard.",

They were harassing people in the yard and they were throwing tear gas canisters.  People were being choked and they were trying to run away crawling outside of the house because they were even throwing this teargas inside the house.  \n On the morning of the funeral a Casper arrived.  When this Casper arrived it was driven by a White policeman, it was full of Black and White policemen and they said nobody is going to go except for me and my children.  The women who were there hid me away and I hid in my neighbour's house.  The policemen came saying that they are only going to collect the family to go to the graveyard.  I ran to my neighbour's house.  When they couldn't find me they threw more teargas canisters and more people fainted due to this.  They went away.  In the afternoon I came back home.  We were being harassed with this teargas all the time.  \n One day people came to tell me that the corpse was not in the mortuary any more, it's in the Kempton Park Police Station.  My son is being detained as a corpse.  As I was listening to that women from the Township went to the Kempton Park Police Station and demanded to know what is happening, but only found out that when they got there it was not only my son who was kept there but many corpses that were killed by the police were there in that police station. The women fought against this.  My child was kept there for the whole month, from the 1st up until the 29th of May when we were given the permit.  The whole month my son's body stayed in the police station after being killed by the police.  We were being harassed by the police with teargas all the time.  One day they even burnt my curtains.\n On the 28th, which was another day now for the night \nTEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 F MALOSI\nvigil, which was a second night vigil the youth came back again.  The policemen came again.  They were coming even during the week to disrupt everything and swearing at us and these policemen threw more teargas in the night vigil.  In the morning when some children wanted to go and wash, those who stayed in Daveyton they met them at Tembisa railway station, they dispersed them and they shot the one boy from Daveyton and killed him.  The comrades brought him to my yard.  My son was not there.  They left this boy's body and the policemen arrived.  We were now being guilty of taking this boy for helping him and they wanted to know why did we do that.  They took this boy and they were swearing at us all the time.\n On the 29th, which was the day of the funeral we were busy cooking outside, the policemen threw more teargas, even inside the pots.  They fenced around the street and they said nobody would be allowed to attend the funeral.  Even the way to the cemetery was blocked.  They released my son and he was buried at the cemetery down.  All these children they were there dead and we managed to bury them. Even when we got to the graveyard there were Caspers full of policemen.  Even when we tried to bury there was teargas all over and people couldn't see properly but we managed to get back home.  There were fences all over blocking with policemen and dogs as well.  We couldn't pass through.  And that is the end.",

It's a very painful story and it seems that\nTEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n8 F MALOSI\nthere was a huge amount of violence which was quite unnecessary.  We are investigating the matter, the name of Scarface or Vusi, which seems to be the other name he had is cropping up constantly today in the statements.
