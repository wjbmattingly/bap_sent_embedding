<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you, you may be seated.  Mamma you have brought someone with you, is that a member of your family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> That's my cousin's daughter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> We would like to welcome her as well.  Mamma you are going to talk about your son who was shot.  Are you able to hear me now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> Yes I hear you well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> You are going to tell us the story about Thomas.  I am not quite sure if he's your son or your grandson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> That's my grandson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> It's your grandson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> Yes, that's my daughter's son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Could you tell us the story that you have come to tell please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> It was one day on a Saturday when I went to the cafe, children came and told me that Thomas has been shot.  Then I went at Diphateng, then I found Thomas being shot and lying there.  The owner of that house was not there inside the house.  Then many people came in that house.  When they arrived there they said soldiers have shot him.  After some time soldiers came and then the police came thereafter, then they took Thomas to Rabasoto mortuary.  Thereafter my sister came.  We stayed two days.  After that the police came to take a statement from the grandfather.  Then the grandfather said we heard from the boys that Thomas has been shot.  Then TEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>2 J MABUYA</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>my brother went there to find out that the soldiers have killed that boy.  That's how far I know.  Then thereafter, before we buried him two people brought some food parcels at our house.  Then the police came again when we were supposed to bury the child on that day.  Then the soldiers came to look for food, then we said we don't have food.  I don't know much about what happened but I heard from people that he has been shot by the soldiers.  Then we went to bury Thomas.  Then we found the police at the cemetery but they didn't start any fight.  Then we returned home.  That's how far I can go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you Miriam. I am going to ask you some questions just so that I can make sure that we have got the facts of your story down properly.  This incident happened in 1976 did it not?</p>

<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> There is nobody who takes care of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> I have no more questions thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> We see that you are now hurt because of what you are saying, just relax, so that we will be able to complete.  May we continue.  I want to know a little bit about Thomas.  What was he doing at that time because you said he was not at school?  We want to understand how did he live?  What was he doing then?</p>

<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>5 J MABUYA</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> When I say how did he live, is what kind of a child, when he wakes up early in the morning where did he go?  Others are going to school, others are going to work, what was he doing?  Was he together with the comrades?  Was he befriending the comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> I don't believe that he was among the comrades.  He was always helping my mother-in-law because my mother-in-law was a little bit hold.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> If you remember during the funeral did the comrades come?  Can you tell the Commission about whatever you may remember those people who were giving speeches then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> Yes the comrades came and they buried him.  They were carrying him from the house to the cemetery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Who was the Minister on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> There was no Minister on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> How did they do the funeral service without the Minister?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> The comrades came and they prayed and then continued with the proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Among the Tembisa residents do you remember who was there to help you to bury your grandson or was it only the youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> Yes there were old people who were there, and even Ministers were there, but at the cemetery I didn't see any Minister doing anything, but the youth were many at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> You said at that time that Thomas was shot by soldiers, did you tell the Police?  Did you lay a charge?  You say the Police came to take a statement, did you lay a charge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>TEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>6 J MABUYA</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> Yes the Police did come and ask us how did you know about the whole incident, then the Police came after the burial, I believe it's about two weeks, then the Rabasoto Police came to take the statement, then we went to Rabasoto to make a statement.  I don't know who knows is his grandfather.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> I want to thank you.  I will ask the Chairperson to talk to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> Thomas' mother left Thomas at his grandparents and then he came in February during the funeral.  I don't know where he is staying.  And even when Thomas' father died he was not there.  Thomas' mother is dumb therefore we are not able to communicate with her so we don't know where she is staying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> We have heard your story.  We will try and find out whether any kind of enquiry took place so that we can get some sense of who was responsible.  We have heard what you said and I wonder if there is anything that you would like to tell the Commission especially before you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS MABUYA:</span> What I want to say is the Whites have killed my child and he could have been working for me.  I am staying alone.  I don't have a husband, I don't have other children, he could have been working for me now.  There is no person who pays rent for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you for coming and sharing that with us.  It is very, very difficult and we know that the price that has had to be paid for freedom in this country has been very, very high.  It is also a numbers of the mothers and grandmothers who have been left behind and who have lost those who would have looked after them in their old age.  The Commission has heard the stories of many older people</p>
