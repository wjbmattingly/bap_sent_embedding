            "On the evening of the first of May 1993 two friends and I went to the airport to fetch a fellow colleague.  From there on our way back we called in at the High Gate Hotel for a quick drink.  We went in and the four of us sat at a table at the centre of the bar.  We ordered drinks and were sitting talking, laughing and joking when we heard something like crackers going off.  Not long thereafter someone shouted, get down the hotel is being attacked.  Soon after that I heard shots being fired and looked towards the door and saw a man wearing a black balaclava with an automatic rifle firing from left to right in the bar.  I ran around the table to lie down where my friends were and I was shot in the back of the leg.  I fell down and noticed that from the top of my right leg above the knee blood was spurting out of a wound about the size of my hand.  Then someone from behind the bar fired shots back and after a while the firing stopped.  I said the my friend on my right, I've been shot and he said lie still pretend that you're dead because they may come back.  My friend on the left was lying face down.  I shook him and called his name but he lay very still.  Everybody was screaming and lying in pools of blood.  They were choking as a result of the teargas.  The blood was still spurting out of my leg and my friend attempted to stop the bleeding by putting his elbow in the hole but without success.\n I heard someone shout phone for an ambulance and the police.  I tried to slide myself into a corner thinking that the attackers may return and shoot at us again but I couldn't move my leg.  I could feel myself getting very weak as I was losing a lot of blood.  After some time the ambulance arrived and my friend and I were taken to hospital.  I was in terrible pain and the blood kept on spurting out.  I can't remember what happened thereafter.  I woke up in the ward the next morning and remained in the hospital for plus minus a month.  I underwent surgery four times.  A pin was placed in my injured leg from the hip to the knee and cannot be removed.  \n After leaving hospital I went daily for physiotherapy for a year and during that period I went for another operation, a bone graft.  I walked on crutches for two and a half years and had to depend on other people for assistance.  My life was changed overnight.  I lost my job and my medical aid.  I had to go to a psychologist for counselling and was put and medication for nerves and depression but I could not continue because my medical aid had expired.  I am still on medication after a period of four years and I still have problems with my injured leg being slightly shorter and I walk with a limp.  I still experience a lot of pain and I can't walk very far as my knee and my ankle collapse.  I also have absolutely no feeling in my foot due to the fact that the nerve had been damaged.  My right hand was also injured when I was shot and I will have to have surgery done in the near future.  My hearing in the right ear has also been affected due to the gunshots.  I am a diabetic and this has further aggravated it by the trauma of this incident.  I will be sixty one years of age in July and have no husband to support me therefore I have to depend on others for financial aid as I am only receiving a grant of Four Hundred and Thirty Rand a month.  I feel that those responsible for killing and injuring innocent people should be found and brought to justice.",
