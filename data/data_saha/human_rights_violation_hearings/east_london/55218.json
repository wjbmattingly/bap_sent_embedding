They\nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 K YALI\nwere wearing boots and we didn't know exactly whether were they police, then they said we have very bad manners as those of our brothers and we just ignored them.  We learned that there was going to be a funeral for somebody who was shot and people were singing.  I went home because I was staying with a grandmother.  When I started cleaning our house and then I went home.  I went to the shop when I came back again.  When I was there I said I was going to the toilet.  After relieving myself I came back and I heard somebody who was busy and it was the police and I thought it was a neighbour who was a Coloured and I thought it is him who was calling me.  When he was turning back I heard a gunshot and then I learnt that this was not child's play.  I ran away.  During that period I learnt that my eyes were unable to open.  At that period there was an exchange of gunfire.  \n Some people got into our house and my grandmother was given information of what was happening.  Then somebody told me that you are shot and there's something which is on the eye.  Then a car was organised that I should be taken to the hospital.  I went to hospital, whilst I was there there were patches on both eyes because I was injured.  There were policemen who came in and they wanted the clothes which I had on during that day.  One of them said this is one of the boys who was there in that house and I saw him carrying a petrol bomb.  I just kept quiet. I was transferred to Port Elizabeth and I was there for three weeks.  \n I returned.  Again when I came back my grandmother told me that there were policemen who came three times looking for me.  I went to Tumeka Tuku who was looking at me while I was at hospital.  The other lady said I must not go there \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 K YALI\nbecause these people want to shoot you or they will take you and arrest you.",
