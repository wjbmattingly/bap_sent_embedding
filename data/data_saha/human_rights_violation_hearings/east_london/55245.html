<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MANDLA ENGELANI:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Mr Chairperson, he has properly sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will hand over to you Reverend Xundu to lead him with questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> We welcome you Mr Engelani.  What is your clan name Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> I am Dakwende.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Dakwende, please tell us briefly your story so that we can be able to know what happened to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> I would like to start on the 1985 massacre in Duncan Village.  I was at home.  There was one man distributing pamphlets.  What I am saying now is not in my statement.  Before this man could come there was one man who came saying that there are people distributing pamphlets around.  He said that these people are dangerous people and he said that if I saw a person who was distributing pamphlets of a guerrilla warfare I must be careful, because they are dangerous.  That is what this man said.  I asked him whether I can quote his name, because he is the one who gave me this information.  He said, no, I must not quote his name, because if I did they will assassinate me, they will point me and kill me.  He then left me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a> The following day after he gave me this message this person came, the one who was distributing pamphlets.  He said to me as I was a person who use to read different books, he said to me I have these books for you to read.  I took one of them and it was written Guerrilla Warfare.  He said that as I was a wise man I am supposed to read this, because people from Westbank are wise people.  So they said that they would like me to join them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Let us get some clarity Sir.  These people were AZAPO members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> He did not identify him as belonging to any member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> But you are a member of AZAPO, you were a member of AZAPO at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> At that time I got along with members of AZAPO, because we use to attend the same school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> In your statement you say that you are a member of AZAPO?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> Yes, but I had no membership card.  I had no membership card at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Was there any conflict between this organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> Mr Chairperson, let me put it this way.  When the white man came to attack us we fought back.  As we were fighting with them, the Boers from the army, after that we, these people came saying that they do not want an AZAPO organisation.  We heard this, we heard that this was happening in Port Elizabeth, but it was happening also in Duncan Village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> This led to this day that you were attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> Yes Sir, because these people accused me of being close to AZAPO members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You were attacked by the Residents Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> And you were brought to a People's Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> What happened is that I got a message that I was going to be attacked and I decided to stay at home.  These people came to my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did you know these people, came to your home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> I do not want to lie Sir.  I never saw them before, but I only recognised two of them, because they are my neighbours.  I asked one of my neighbour saying that you are also part of this.  He said, yes, I am part of this, because you are a member of AZAPO.  We are fighting against AZAPO and South African Municipality and we are fighting against the Government in Pretoria.  That is what this man said to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did you know any AZAPO members who were also attacked in this way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> They were not attacked in a similar way Sir, but there are others who were attacked, but not in a similar  way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> They assaulted you and they left you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Who was with you at home?  Who witnessed this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> I was together with my sisters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> They saw this and they can give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> Yes, they were there and they can come and given evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You were taken to hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> Yes, but I did not go to a free hospital, because it was difficult at that time.  I came to Mdantsane in the clinic in NU9.  I spent a night to my brother in NU11A and I would go to the clinic every morning, but unfortunately, in the clinic they told me to go to the doctor and I was then taken to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did you lay a charge concerning this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> Yes, I tried when I was released from the hospital, because my doctor said I was badly injured.  These people wanted to kill me.  The doctors advised me to go and lay a charge.  I went to the UDF offices in Paverville and they said that they heard about this incident.  They said that those who attacked me were the thugs.  So the UDF office said that they did not know whether they were AZAPO members of UDF members.  They told me to go to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did you go to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What happened to that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> I went to the Office of Intimidation.  They were then arrested, but the case did not get anywhere.  They were not sentenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Sir, what do you expect the Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> What I would like the Commission to do for me is that I am attending Wits College.  I would like to get a bursary to further my studies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Where are you studying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> I am studying at Wits, Witwatersrand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Do you have a wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> I have a girlfriend and I am staying with her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You are only staying together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Reverend Finca can help you to get married if you want to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR ENGELANI:</span> I will be very glad if he can do that.</p>
