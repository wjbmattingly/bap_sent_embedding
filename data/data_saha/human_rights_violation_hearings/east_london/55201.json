Some of it coming from the state, some of it coming from resistance movements, but tragically there's also been differences between organisations and the story you're going to tell today has something to do with that. You have waited a very long time to tell this story.  The incident that you will talk about happened in 1985.  We hope that in the telling of this story, you will be comforted and that you will also be helped.  In leading the evidence, we have Mr Tsiki Sandi and he will assist you to tell the story that's in your heart.  Thank you.",

Well I received a telephone call one afternoon at work and I was told to be at Port Alfred very urgently, something terrible had happened. It was Thembisile and Moja, his friend.\n We left from work, we went to the location and we were taken there by the teacher Mr Makupula by a van.  He took us to Port Alfred. When we reached Port Alfred, we found a gentleman who was at BAB.  He said to me, \"Mrs Mata, something terrible has happened. It was terrible here at Port Alfred.  We report the people who are dead now\". \n We went with Mr Makupula from Port Alfred to the police station.  The police led us to the scene of the funeral.  We found the people there. When we arrived here we were asked if we would like to see the victims and we agreed to that. We were taken by Mrs Andoni, Moja's mother, to where the bodies were.  When we reached this place, there was a small house in which we were accommodated and then this house was opened and we were shown the bodies.\n When we saw the bodies I was unable to control myself.  I was hurt because they were pitch black and you couldn't identify them as their faces were unrecognisable but he removed the cover, he was dried out, his knees were fixed together, then one of my sons said to me, \"I didn't want to come and identify the bodies\".  Then we went with Mr Makupula to the location where Thembisile was working.  At his place of employment we were given his belongings and then we went back home to Grahamstown.\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 N E MATA\n When we reached there the teacher who accompanied us was staying at K Street.  My husband was ill at the time, and when Mr Makupula came in, you know I strengthened myself  and tried to be as brave as possible because I didn't want to make my husband realise that there was something terrible, but the tears just dropped from my eyes.  Mr Mata was told to come and listen to what has happened.  He was given the report back about the bad tidings.  It was mentioned that they were no longer alive.  He was shocked to learn about this.  It was on a Wednesday and this happened the night before.\n At Port Alfred we had arranged some of the things with the undertakers.  We had already got the coffins so that the funeral arrangements can go on undisturbed.  When we reached our destination in Grahamstown we went to the place of employment, we were asked what we were going to do.  We told them that we have already made funeral arrangements.  Our manager Mrs Rodment said to us, they learned at Port Alfred the dead children would be escorted here.  We agreed to the fact that they should be transported to their places.  It was said they should not be kept for a long time because they were already damaged.  \n The funeral took place on a Saturday. Thembisile and Moja were buried on the same day.  They were different denominations Etheopean and the  Methodist.",
