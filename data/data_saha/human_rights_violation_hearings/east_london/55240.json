Because I was sleeping in my employer's home I didn't know when he left.\n The following week on a Thursday my daughter said that the Special Branch Police from Cambridge came asking for Masibulele Tonisi, asking his whereabouts and they said they did not know where he was.  The Special Branch Police said that he was in Maseru and they asked for his parent they told them that I'm at work and I would come back during the weekend.  They came back the following week on Thursday and I was at home.  They asked me questions about him as to whether he was still at school, how old he was and where he was.   I said that I didn't know and they told me he was in Maseru but they wanted him to come back to East London.  I asked why and they said that the Government was looking for him then I asked them where I am going to find him.  \n They then left that Thursday and the following week when I got home my children told me the police came with three vans and they searched the house saying they were looking for letters from Masibulele in Maseru.  My children asked them how they knew that he was writing letters because he didn't write any letters to us.  The police would come now and then asking about his whereabouts they also asked for my employers address and they went there to ask the whereabouts of Masibulele.  We heard that he was in East Germany and then after a while we heard he was in Angola.",
