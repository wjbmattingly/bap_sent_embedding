<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Monakali, you are going to talk about Mxolisi Anthony Monakali.  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How are you related?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> That is myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What is your story?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Can I proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> I was in a boxing tournament in 1981, fifth of June.  This boxing tournament was in David Mama High School, NU1.  That proceeded well.  On the morning of the sixth of June Mr Mlandu, that I know well from the neighbourhood, got into the school hall and reprimanded us for making noise.  He got, he beat up a girl quite badly.  Everybody was scared.  The tournament organisers begged him to let them be.  Apparently one of the clubs that was going to come was a visiting club and, therefore, they had to prepare well.   Mr Mlandu then left saying he is coming back.  He came back with a huge gun, got into the hall.  Some people jumped out of the windows, pulled open the door.  I was one of the people who were able to run away.  I ran away with a friend, Jonglizwe Sipoenzi.  We got to a friend's place where we were going to sleep.  However, it was locked.  We went back to David Mama, because it was lit and it was, quite a bit of noise.  We went back there.  As David Mama had two blocks I went to the one and he went to the other.  There were people surrounding a bakkie.  I think that bakkie was the transport used by the visiting boxers.  Not far from the hall door I heard a noise.  I ran away.  A second gunshot, I heard just, I got shot on my side and I fell down on a, the field in David Mama.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mr Monakali, who was shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Mr Mlandu was shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You got injured on your arm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is there any part, any other part of your anatomy that you got injured in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Yes, around my waist.  My kidneys were injured.  Especially the one that had to be removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Could you tell us how badly your arm was injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> I could see my muscles and bones.  There was an operation, grafting my skin from my, back of my thigh onto my arm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How long did you stay in hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> About two months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Which hospital was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Cecilia Makiwane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You did not go to any other hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> No, I just went to Dr van Niekerk with my mother to, for him to examine my arm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Who was your legal representative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Mr Mxenge came with my mother at the hospital. ADV SANDI:  Is this the late Mr Mxenge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> He took down your details?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Yes, he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What eventually happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Because he worked in Durban he referred us to Mr Siwisa.  When we were called to come on the Saturday to meet Mr Siwisa he told us that Mr Mxenge had passed on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You said that Mr Louw took over at some point.  Where is Mr Louw from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> It is Dr van Niekerk whom we had spoken to that referred us to Mr Louw.  I gave Mr Louw my file from the hospital and he took a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is he an attorney from East London?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is he still around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> I do not know.  I will look around, I have tried to look around, but I have not found him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did Mr Louw help you through your claim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> When we went with my mother we did not find him.  He was, he had moved from that building.  We tried to find him, because the then occupant of the building did not know this Mr Louw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Are you saying that he disappeared?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Yes, he did.  He did not even let us know anything, I mean, he had all our details including our addresses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did Mr Louw work with any other attorneys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> I only met with him once when Dr van Niekerk had arranged it.  I tried to find Mr van, Dr van Niekerk, but he had moved to Great Britain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> In our statements, in your statement before us you have requests.  Could you briefly tell us about these?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> If I could help, if I could get help where my health is concerned.  I hurt now and again physically and losing a part of my body at such a young age.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You say that you were 15 when all this happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Yes, I was 15.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Monakali.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> June Crichton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Can you hear me Mr Monakali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Just two questions to you.  When Mlandu came in to shoot, was he on his own or were there other police with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> He was on his own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Had he ever been at boxing tournaments before, that you had seen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> It was not the first time there was a boxing tournament at David Mama.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> No, my question to you was had you seen him at boxing tournaments before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> No Mam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> So your statement is that he came into that hall and without any warning he began to shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> He did not shoot the first time, because he was not armed.  Then we dispersed.  I also left.  He only started shooting after we had come back again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Monakali, were you a member of a political organisation at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> No, I was a boxer at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there political unrest at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> It was just a boxing tournament at the school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> According to your statement you were shot at because you were making a noise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> The tournament was around senior boxers final matches, therefore people were excited.  There was a lot of noise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were the people toy-toying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> No, there was no toy-toy.  It was just experienced first class boxers that were, that was exciting the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In your perception do you think this matter is politically orientated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MONAKALI:</span> It was wickedness.  I, there, I would see no reason why he shot.  He said that he did not want any boxing tournaments at schools, because the Department of Education in Ciskei was concerned that the school furniture was being spoilt.  That, those are one of the major reasons that he brought forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  We will look at this case closely.  Maybe we will come back to you with more detail, because as a Commission, we are looking closely at political conflicts.  We are going to ascertain how politically orientated your matter is or perhaps we should hand this case over to a Court of Law as just any other normal crime.  However, we will look closely at this matter and we will let you know. Thank you for now.</p>
