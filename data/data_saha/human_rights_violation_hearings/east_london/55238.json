I asked his friends if they didn't see him but they said they didn't see him.  One week lapsed into another one and the police would come not even getting out of the police van.  I'd ask the children playing outside ...  After the second week a little girl said that she'd heard that Bongani had been shot.  We went to Unit 1 in Mdantsane at the mortuary and asked them for a corpse that would have been brought in on the first of August.  They did show us the corpse.  The police then requested that they be taken to the child that gave the report  that Bongani had been shot.  This child said that he'd been talking about a different Bongani.  We tried to explain to this child that we just wanted the truth.  They gave up.  Apparently Bongani  had been brought in by the policemen from Unit 12 who were referred back to them.  We spoke to the policeman who was handling this case and he said that he'd been shot whilst trying to burn down a policeman's house.  Apparently there were warning shots and he got shot.  We were shown what they had with them.  There were containers and I realised that these containers were not dirty as if someone was going to burn down a house because there was just water in the containers.  These were containers that they'd taken to the place of prayer.\n My husband and I received a letter to go to court and we were told to get an attorney.  We were confused and we didn't know what was happening or why we needed legal representation.  We had to appear in court but they kept on postponing the date until they stopped and that was that.",
