<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  I will hand over to Tiny Maya who is going to lead you with questions on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Sthembiso you are going to talk about what happened to you in March 1990 when you were on your back to the Sharpeville Day rally.  Please tell us what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR NJOLI:</span> We came out of Gombo Stadium.  When we were, we were coming to Mdantsane.  The traffic cops were leading us and when we were about to be in Mdantsane they decided to leave us and then the caspar came, soldiers saying that we must, must control the crowd.  When we got to, next to Crave, next to Crave Meat Industries a hippo, the vans hooted at us and when we were about the corner I heard gunshots.  When I looked up I saw a car, a red car, it was coming towards us.  I ran away and I lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a> When I regained consciousness I was in a car, a bakkie. We were taken to the hospital.  I was told to take off my clothes.  I lost consciousness again.  On the following morning the man who knocked down these people came to see us in the hospital.  Our doctor said that we were children from the toy-toy.  I heard that some of us lost their legs.  I wanted to know how.  The doctor said that he is going to amputate me, amputate my leg.  I said that he must call my mother.  My mother then visited me in hospital.  I told him, I told her that the doctor is referring to us as children of toy-toy.  Also the nurses were calling us children of toy-toy.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a> I stayed there for four months.  They discharged me in the fourth month.  I went to the hospital again for a checkup.  The doctor said that he has to cut my leg.  I said that what is wrong with my leg, because I can be able to work.  I asked him why did you discharge me if I was not well.  I then went back home, went to the village.  Again I felt pain in my leg.  I went to Bisho.  From Bisho they transferred me to Cecilia Makiwane Hospital.  I decided to go to the attorneys so that this case can be investigated.  They did.  We appeared in court.  The man who knocked us down was in court.  We were told that the case was postponed, we will be called again.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a> 34 People got injured in this incident, six died, 28 people sustained minor injuries.  I wondered what happened to other people, those who were injured.  My lawyer said that you are here on your own.  They will find their own lawyers.  </p>
