I then said that was not the case, but I told him the whole story.  My \nchild's father, my child is 11 years old now.  I took him to the special school in town.  \nHe would tear up his clothes at Dumangeni Mental Hospital.  \n He came back at home one day and he was injured in his body.

The statement is as follows,\n \"I, the undersigned, Donald John Card do hereby state \nI am retired, 68 years of age, and reside at 5 Avon \nRoad, Woodleigh, East London.\n I have been served with a notice by the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission in terms of Act 34 of \n1995, wherein I am informed that one Shumikazi \nSarah Jako will be testifying before the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission and would be implicating \nme.  Once again, it is difficult to answer to lies when \nso little information is made available to me by the \nCommission.\n Also, the date makes no sense because from June 1962 \nto 17 December 1962 I was stationed in Port Elizabeth \nand did not work in this area at all.  When I returned in \nDecember 1962 I was immediately put in charge of a \nserious murder case where two young girls had been \nburnt to death and then in January 1963 I was sent to \nPretoria for over a month.  The name Jako does ring a \nbell, but I cannot remember if it was a lady from \nTafalehashe, near Elliotdale, or a lady from Zwelitsha. \n Both these people were connected to a plan brought \nfrom the PAC in exile (Lesotho) by a man by the name \nof Clippard Komsana.  The PAC required money and \nplans were set afoot for the Good Hope Textile's \nwages to be robbed, as also the Debe Neck Post \nOffice.  Both these ladies were involved, but none of \nthem were assaulted by me or anyone else in my \npresence.  The story that they were assaulted in order \nto establish where there husbands was nonsense, \nbecause Clippard Komsana told us all about the \nintended robberies, and had a message from the \nhusband, so there was no reason for assaulting them.\n I cannot believe that the complainants speaks of other \npolicemen, yet only mentions my name.  Why is only \nmy name remembered?  I find it strange that a number \nof people made false allegations against me and I \nrequest the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to \ninvestigate and to find out who is behind this whole \naffair and to have those who are found to be making \nfalse allegations charged with purgery.\n Signed by Donald John Card.\".",

You did not even know that your husband was a \nmember of the PAC.  You have given up a lot in your life.  You even left your own \nhome, went into exile hoping that one day you will be a free woman in your own \ncountry.  However, you came back home with no family, with no job, with no home, \nyou had nothing.  This is very painful.  Thank you for opening your heart up like this \nbefore us.  We trust that the requests that you have given us, as we are going to take \nthem before the President, perhaps something can be done for you.  Thank you Mrs \nJako.  You may take your place.\n We have taken our last ladies.  We want to ask for forgiveness, Mrs Priscilla \nMaxongo, who was going to give a background and a summary of the struggle for \nwomen.  If we can continue tomorrow with her, because of the circumstances.  I want \nto thank all the women who gave themselves time to be with us here today.  We thank \nespecially, because they came here under such circumstances in this weather, \nstruggling, having no electricity lost a lot of hours.  However, they showed a lot of \npatience, long suffering.  We did not think that you would be here until this time \nopening up your hearts to hear your stories.  We thank you for the respect that you \nhave given us.  We want you to know that the intention we had for today, the struggle \nfor liberation is usually perceived as being a mens' world, but I want you to know that \nwe are aware of the contribution women have had to the liberation and the struggle for \nliberation in this country.  Because of the way we are socialised women mostly stay at \nhome and look after the children, bringing up the children so that the men are able to \nbe out there.  Unfortunately, because women are socialised to do that and as I perceive \nit, it is the most important struggle.  If women were not there, the children would \nsuffer a lot.  Women tend to be altruistic in that sense.  \n Men, sons and husbands have lost their lives being shot in the struggle.  We, as \na Commission as well, have listened mostly to men.  We thought we would dedicate \nthis day to you so that you may tell us your stories about yourselves in your own \nspecial day.  We thank you.  We want you to know that in the South African history \nyour stories are very important and documented so that we get all details and nothing \nis hidden.  We trust that as you have opened your hearts up like this, these stories will \nplay or contribute a lot to reconciliation in our country.  However, lastly, I would like \nto say we have won the struggle for liberation, but the struggle for women continues, \nbecause we are twice oppressed.  Apartheid oppressed by the police, the past regime.  \nSecondly, we are looked as the lower gender.  We want everybody to know that \nwomens' rights are also human rights.  Thank you very much.
