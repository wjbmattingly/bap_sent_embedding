            "I was at work.  I was on night duty.  There was, our niece was \nthere, Sheila, my daughter and Mr Galelekile was also there.  On the 29th of March \n1990, it was on a Thursday.  President Mandela was going to be in Bisho on the 31st \nin the stadium.  I was on a night shit in Mount Cook Hospital.  My husband was \nworking for the Hector Foundation.  I heard a one year, three months baby.  During \nthe day I looked after the baby.  At night my husband was looking after the baby.  I \nwould give him a report about what had happened during the day.  I went to work, my \nhusband was not at home.  I was worried, because my child was not well at that time.  \n At about one in the morning I received a telephone call from the matron.  They \nrequested me to go to the office together with one person I was working with.  We \nasked the security man to accompany us to the office.  When we got to the office they \nsaid that Sheila was alone at home.  The baby was sick, your husband was not at \nhome.  He attended a meeting.  Pindile and Andile are here to take you home.  They \nasked me whether I knew Pindile.  I said, yes, Pindile was my neighbour.  They asked \nwhether I knew Andile.  I thought that Andile was their niece.  I said, yes, I do know \nAndile.  We were taken to the car.  I asked them why are you here.  They said that \nthey told my matron.\n At home the lights were on.  I went through the kitchen door.  I saw this child \nstaying in bed.  I asked where is my baby.  My baby was lying down and we heard \nthat, they told me that my husband was shot and he died.  People said that my husband \ncame back home at about nine.  His friend brought him home, Monde Mkhunqwana.  \nThey were studying together social sciences.  They use to go and study in Sandiswe \nSchool.  He left my husband at home.  My husband took off his jacket and his shoes.  \nHe was watching television.  He heard a knock at the door.  It was Andile together \nwith another young man.  I found out later on that that young man was the cadre.  \n At about 20 past nine there was another knock at the door.  My husband went \nto the kitchen.  Our kitchen door had two doors.  He asked who are you?  This person \nsaid that I am Monks.  This Monks is Monde Mkhunqwana.  He then opened the \ndoor.  There was a quarrel at the door.  My husband saying that why are you selling \nme out?  He then said that, Comrades, let us not fight, let us talk.  There was a \ngunshot.  The second one struck him and he fell down.  Andile went to the bedroom.  \nHe took out a knife from his pocket, because he thought these were the police.  He \ntried to hide under the bed.  The other young man just stood in the dining-room.  My \none child was 13 years old at the time. \n My child saw a man wearing a balaclava and a black jacket.  This man was \nshooting my husband while he was lying down.  After that he left and the other one \ntook a mat outside and they covered him with this mat.  This young man told my child \nto go and close the door.  My child then closed and locked the door.  He phoned their \ngrandfather, Duno Bamsouli.  At that time he was in Pretoria.  He then phoned the \nneighbours.  This young man was still there.  They did not see him leaving, leaving the \nhouse.  After that the police came and they took him.  They cleaned blood spots.\n When I arrived at home there was no blood.  Everything was clean.  There \nwere no photographers.  The following morning Monde Mkhunqwana came.  We \nwere in the bedroom at that time.  He said that I was together with Saule the whole \nday and the person who knocked at the door identified himself as myself.  I dropped \nhim at about nine.  When I was going back home at NU16 I heard gunshots and \nMonde Mkhunqwana was the one saying this.  The police came in the morning saying \nthat we must go to the police station.  I made a statement.  I thought that the people \nwho killed my husband were the police.  I said to them I suspect Sitilie Golo, because \nhe was the one harassing us at home.",

I said that because he was working for the ANC the ANC people will \nhelp me to find the perpetrator.  \n Again I visited the investigators of the Truth Commission saying that I had \ninformation. My daughter-in-law had information.  Patricia Msawuli said that Andile is \nwilling to come forward to tell people in public who did this.
