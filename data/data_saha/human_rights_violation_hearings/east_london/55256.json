On the morning of the sixth of June Mr Mlandu, that I know well from the neighbourhood, got into the school hall and reprimanded us for making noise.  He got, he beat up a girl quite badly.  Everybody was scared.  The tournament organisers begged him to let them be.  Apparently one of the clubs that was going to come was a visiting club and, therefore, they had to prepare well.   Mr Mlandu then left saying he is coming back.  He came back with a huge gun, got into the hall.  Some people jumped out of the windows, pulled open the door.  I was one of the people who were able to run away.  I ran away with a friend, Jonglizwe Sipoenzi.  We got to a friend's place where we were going to sleep.  However, it was locked.  We went back to David Mama, because it was lit and it was, quite a bit of noise.  We went back there.  As David Mama had two blocks I went to the one and he went to the other.  There were people surrounding a bakkie.  I think that bakkie was the transport used by the visiting boxers.  Not far from the hall door I heard a noise.  I ran away.  A second gunshot, I heard just, I got shot on my side and I fell down on a, the field in David Mama.",
