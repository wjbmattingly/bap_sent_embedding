            "Yes I can.  Mncedisi went away in 1975 between August and September.  He left the place whilst attending school at Zweletemba in Kingwilliamstown.  During that period Charles Sebe came with a list of the lists of children.  They were 15 in number and he said they went to Tanzania.  They went to establish homes there.  Two weeks after he came, security forces came from Cambridge and visited my mother whom they asked the whereabouts of her son. My mother said that he was at school, she didn't give the information that Charles was here to the security officers.  The people came here and asked frequently, and my mother insisted that the child was at school.  This continued for several years, and we didn't hear anything about what happened, but the security forces kept on visiting us.\n I think it was in 1980, the security officers composed of black people came here.  Then when they saw that my mother was afraid, they said she must not fear, they are doing their job there. At some stage my mother began to feel very ill.  She was an invalid because she was disturbed by this.  She suffered a stroke in 1987 and her face was disfigured until 1990 when she died in February.\n I was the survivor and then there was a person who came EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 P N SABATANA\nfrom my place who told me that Mncedisi is still alive.  He said he saw him in 1978.  He said there was a meeting in Tanzania and he saw the child.  I was happy to learn that he was still alive because we were afraid that there were people coming.  Although he was not coming back, some of the that were in exile were aware that he was still alive.  I was always hoping that any day he may come in and return from exile. In 1994 I received card which I'm showing to you.  It says they were at a meeting in Tanzania.\n As I last saw him a very long time ago I doubted his face.  They showed me that he was in the first row and is the one with the cap on.  Why he used a hat was because he was burned while still very young.",

They said there was somebody who came from Johannesburg who tried to find out about our family and our surname, but they discovered that nobody knows about this surname.  The person who phoned said she knew about this surname and then she said she's going to phone at Zone 2 to find out of Mbongani knows me. When she phoned at Zone 2, she didn't find anybody and then she looked up in the directory and got the family reflected in there.  She phoned the number and then she could communicate with me.\n She explained that she doesn't know me, and then she said she is Veli Tswaclina and said there was a young man who was looking for me, during the Easter weekend. But there was nobody who knew this surname.  So I explained that I \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n8 P N SABATANA\nwill try and establish if I can get information about this surname so that I can give her the information that she needed.  \n This person gave me the telephone number where I should phone, I tried to phone this number, I was informed that this person who said that I must phone had left for Johannesburg.  I gave the information that I am Nobesuthu because this person said he was asking after us.  The reply that I got is that this person had left and then when he phones they will tell him about what has happened and give him the information that I have just given her.\n On the 10th, when we came back from King Williamstown I received a telephone call, it was from Unit 13, this person said to me I should please phone Monde at 9 o'clock, and he said I must not miss that time.  I did as instructed and it was nine in the evening.  I phoned at 9 o'clock as instructed. I found this person at 9 o'clock and I gave him my particulars.  At the same time he answered and said he is the person who was looking for us.  I informed him that I was responding to the message that he was looking for us.\n He asked me what I last heard about my brother.  I told him that we didn't hear anything about him.
