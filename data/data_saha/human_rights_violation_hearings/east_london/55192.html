<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>NTSEBEZA:   Before I hand over to Dr Boraine, there is a request here.  Some people </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>take these things home with them.  I know they are not doing that deliberately it's just a </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>mistake, if you go home with this equipment, it's not going to help you in any way.  If you </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>mistakenly take it, please bring it back, so that they can charge it over night for further </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>use.  I know that we understand each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>DR BORAINE:   As was announced earlier, there are three witnesses who will take the </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>stand together, and I'm going to call out their names and ask them if they will please come </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>and take up their seats.  Mrs Nomonde Calata, Mrs Sendiswa Mkhonto, Mrs Nombuyiselo </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>Mhlawuli.  I will speak to each of you individually in order to start the proceedings, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>Mrs Calata, would you stand please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>NOMONDE CALATA:   (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>SANDISWA MKHONTO:     (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>NOMBUYISELO MHLAWULI: (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>DR BORAINE:   I understand that a request was made by Mrs Goniwe to hold over her </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>evidence until tomorrow, and we are respect that, but we are very grateful that you have  </p>

<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>1 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>joined the other three because you belong together, as we all know. The 27th of June 1985 </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>is a day which will be indelibly printed in your minds and in your hearts and in the minds </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>of many, many thousands and hundreds of thousands of people in South Africa.  Many </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>people within this hall and many of us sitting at this table knew your husbands well. We </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>had met them, we had worked with them and like you we heard with horror of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>gruesome killing of those four, the Cradock Four.  One of the reasons why we started the </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>hearings in the Eastern Cape, was because of the terrible oppression that has taken place in </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>this part of South Africa, and we thought, instead of starting in one of the big cities, as so </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>many other things are, it was right to start here.  And you know as well as I do and as the </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>Commission knows, that everybody who comes to this Commission is as important as </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>anyone else. Everyone who has suffered is a sufferer, you have come together and you </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>will be answering questions about something that was very very painful for you.  We're </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>hoping very much that you will find this experience helpful and healing and in the end </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>will enable the Commission to be of some service to you as well.  Mr John Smith will lead </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>the questions and I'm going to hand over to him now. Thank you so much for coming.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>MR SMITH:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Good morning Mrs Calata, how are you? </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>MRS CALATA:   Good morning Mr Smith. Fine thank you, and you? </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>MR SMITH:   Mrs Calata, I've got a copy of a statement which you have made and I've </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>also consulted with you at length, we have spoken about this matter.  So I'm going to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>asking you questions and trying to get some of the important issues</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>2 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>out in leading you.  But I want you to feel relaxed and if there's anything you want to add, </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>to what you're going to say, please feel free at any time. If you should leave out anything </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>which is important I will alert you to it, so don't feel nervous about it at all. Okay? Thank </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a> Maybe we should start off by asking you to introduce yourself to the Commission </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>here, tell us who you are and where you're from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>MRS CALATA:   I am Nomonde Calata, a wife to the late Fort Calata.  My birthplace is </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>in Cradock, I met Fort in 1974 there in Cradock.  Unfortunately we had child </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>unexpectedly and this child was unplanned, but we got married in 1980 and were blessed </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>with two children. The eldest is Dorothy, she'll be 21 very soon.  We have Lukanyo, he is </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>14 years old, Thomani is going to be 11 on the 8th of August 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>MR SMITH:   To correct you, you also have a third child. Your third child is 10 years old, </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes Thomani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>MR SMITH:   Thomani.  Thomani was born immediately after the funeral of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>husband, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>MRS CALATA:   Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>MR SMITH:   What are your children doing at the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>MRS CALATA:   Lukanyo is at Adlidge Gymnasium doing standard 7, Thomani is in </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>Cradock Primary doing Standard 3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>MR SMITH:   Thank you, now your husband Fort Calata has had quite a strong </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>background in his family in so far as politics is concerned, is that right?  Would you like to </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>tell the Commission about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>MRS CALATA:   The grandfather to Fort was a general secretary to the ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>organisation during the treason trial. </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>Fort was born during that period. This name Fort was given EAST LONDON  HEARING</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>3 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>by the grandmother, because she used to pay visits during the trial and she informed the  </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>grandfather that there is a child and he was named Fort, because at the time that he, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>grandfather was at the Fort Prison. </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>MR SMITH:   When you got married to Fort in 1980, was he involved in politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>MRS CALATA:   In 1976 he was involved because it was the time of the struggle.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>Everybody was conscious now.  During the time when he was at school, he typed a letter </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>to the municipality in Cradock, trying to inform them about the way in which they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>overworked, the streets were dirty and also how they used to carry on with the bucket </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>system. He was detained for this involvement and for this explanation and then he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>cross-questioned and why he wrote these letters, which he wrote anonymously, but they </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>could traced that he was the source of these letters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>MR SMITH:   At this stage, is it correct that at some stage you were living in Dimbasa </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>and Fort was teaching there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes he started teaching in Dimbasa, in 1979 an din 1980.  Before our </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>marriage he was detained in Dimbasa for three weeks.  After he was released from </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>detention, I cannot remember very well, under which section he was detained, but he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>on his way to school in the morning, thereafter he was released for a few months and then </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>we got married in October 1980.  He ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>MR SMITH:   Back to Cradock at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>MRS CALATA:   No I didn't stay with him in Dibasa, I was still in Dimbasa and he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>the only one who was teaching in Dimbasa, so that is why he requested that he should be</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>back to ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>MR SMITH:   In Cradock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>4 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes he get a transfer in Cradock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>MR SMITH:   In 1983 you related a story that he came back from school one day and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>was very happy about a particular teacher that he met.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes he came back in 1983, he told us that there was a new teacher at </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>school and he loves this teacher very much. They are communicating very well and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>share the same interests.  I was also interested about this teacher and then one morning </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>when I was going on duty this teacher came to visit us.  He introduced him as Matthew </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>Goniwe.  He and Fort then became friends thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>MR SMITH:   Yes they started to be friends ever since.  At that moment there were some </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>houses that were being built there in Cradock, so we decide to get one of the houses and </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>then we took it as accommodation. There was a sliding scale and rentals were charged </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>according to earnings and it ranged from R24.99 to R89. Because my husband was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>teacher he paid the R89.  The community of Cradock felt that this was too much for them, </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>because it is a small place and the people were not earning much, even if they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>employed.  So they decided to put this and present it to all the teachers there in Cradock, </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>and tried to request them  if they could  assist in trying to negotiate for a reduction of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>rentals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a> Then a meeting was organised to discuss this issue. that is where the committee </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>was elected which was going to handle all this and Matthew was the chairperson of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>Committee and Fort was a treasurer.  There were also other members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>MR SMITH:   You're referring to the formation of Cradora?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes.  This organisation then started to become more important and then </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>it was named as Cradock Residents EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>5 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>Association, abbreviated as Cradora. There was also the youth organisation which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>also in existence, and this organisation was trying to bring about discipline and morals to </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>the youth which was beginning to disintegrate, and Fort was the president of that youth </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>association.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a> Time went on and people agreed together that this will be taken up in court, this </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>rent issue. R5,00 were gathered so that we can get ourselves a lawyer.  As this carried on, </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>preparing to  challenge this in court, time went on, UDF started.  Our organisations </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>decided that we should get into UDF because it was strong at that time, and it was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>organisation with a vision, and we affiliated with the UDF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>Whilst still affiliating with them, things went on and I was arrested in  November 1983.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>was fetched from work.  I was wearing a T-shirt on which was printed, "Free Mandela". I </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>was then arrested and charged just because of that T-shirt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a> While waiting for the case it was postponed and postponed, My lawyer was Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>Suwisa at the time, and Mr Booysen Weranni.  In December 1983, the schools were </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>closed, Matthew received a telegram, informing him about his transfer to Graaf Reniet, </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>but  he dearly wanted to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>in Cradock to be with his wife.  It really didn't appeal to his lawyers that Matthew should </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>be the chairman of this organisation. This was taken to the officials and the Department of </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>Education and Training was involved in these negotiations. While negotiating, there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>new school built which is now known as Matthew Goniwe High School, but at first it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>Lengelishle High School.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a> In January when the schools reopened...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>MR SMITH:   Did anything happen during the process of negotiations between the </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>community and the authorities </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>5 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>regarding Matthew's transfer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>MRS CALATA:   During that time of negotiations with  Education and Training to </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>reinstate Matthew, instead of him receiving a letter telling him that his transfer will be </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>cancelled, he only received a telegram saying he has been dismissed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>MR SMITH:   On that particular year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes it was in December.  Now in January, when the students went back </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>to the schools, they found out that Matthew is not available, it was true that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>Department fired him.  The schools reopened, school boycotts started, pupils were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>going to school, they wanted Matthew to be reinstated.  Parents were at the same time </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>negotiating with the Department of Education and Training.  But you know nothing </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>actually never came up from the Department of Education, whether to reinstate Matthew </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>or not.  On the 31st of March, in 1984, it was 10 o'clock in the evening, we were sleeping, </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>we heard lots and lots of cars outside, I said to my husband, "No let us not wake up, let's </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>wait and see what happens."  We heard knocks at windows at the front of the house, all </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>over.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a> Because I was always close to him I tried to be very strong.  We stood up and lit </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>up the house.  I said to them. "If you are not going to knock at the door only, I'm not going </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>to open". They knocked at the door, Mr Venter stepped in, he had a paper in his hands but </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>he never showed it to me, what was written on it, he said to me, "Where is Mr Calata, </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>we're here to detain him in terns of the Internal Security Act."  </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a> My husband was in the room, he already had his clothes on and he was wearing </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>very warm clothes.  There policemen, EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN </p>

<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>6 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>I can remember, it's Mr Venter, Mr Kawia, a black man, it was Mr Strauss who was </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>wearing uniform and had a small stick in his hand. They were not very patient with him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>they were pushing him, they were really hurrying and I requested that they must please not </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>push him or handcuff him because he's got a chest problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>MR SMITH:   Would you like some time Mrs Calata, are you fine to continue?  Let me </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>just assist you with this whole process, I'll put...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>MRS CALATA:   After leaving with him, they handcuffed him behind his back.  Because </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>I was also waiting for a trial for wearing a T-shirt, I didn't know where he was taken to, </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>there was no word about my husband. </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a> The following morning I woke up to go to work and tried to ask the police where </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>they took him because I wanted to give him some tablets.  They said they would come and </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>tell me and I went to work but there was absolute silence. I went for my own case on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>11th of April in 1984, the case was discussed and I was charged for three months </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>imprisonment or a fine of R800.  I paid R250 a month because I couldn't leave my </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>children alone at home without their father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a> The following day I went to work after this case of mine.  When I arrived at work, </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>I was working at the Provincial Hospital at Cradock, they said the matron would like to </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>see me. Well I went to the Superintendent with the matron, there was a form on the table </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>which they said I must sign. I asked them to read me the form but they refused.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>informed me that they want to make me leave the job.  I asked them if we could wait until </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>the case is finished, but they never gave me the chance and just dismissed me with </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>immediate effect.  They said that I shouldn't be seen </p>

<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>7 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>anywhere around the premises in the hospital and I went home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>MR SMITH:   After your dismissal on that day, your husband was still in detention at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>time. Did you manage ...(indistinct) after your dismissal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>MRS CALATA:   The police came to tell me he was in Diepkloof Prison in Johannesburg. </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>We applied for a permit to go and see him.  I went to see him in May for the first time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>The second time when I asked for a permit to visit him, it was after supper time, the police </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>said to us they don't take permits after their meals.  I went home, and just at the entrance </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>police took me, and put me into their cars. I tried to shout to my dad that I am being taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>by the police, because I could see him in the distance.  At the police station, the head of </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>the police asked to see my identity document.  I gave them my document with the hope </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>that  I may see my husband.  At that time I was carrying a so-called Coloured ID. They </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>asked me, if I am going to vote now for the tricameral parliament.  Before I could answer </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>that question, they said that they knew that I could not even vote, because they knew that </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>I'm a member of the ANC.  I never gave them an answer, I just kept quiet.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a> They were now threatening me, saying, "Your children long to see their father, </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>hey, they will never see him".  And I asked them what child doesn't want to see his or her </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>father?  They told me that I will never ever be employed in Cradock. What will we eat </p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>because my husband was in prison and my children had to go to school?  I just kept quiet. </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a> Eventually at about six, when it was dark in the town, and I didn't have a permit to </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>see my husband, I went to see Fort and I said to him that I have bad news for him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>MR SMITH:   In May 1984 you saw your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes that was my second visit.  He stayed six months in detention and </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>was released on the 3rd of October.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>MR SMITH:   I want to take you back to the 2nd of May 1985.  Your husband was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>around on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>MRS CALATA:   In May Fort was not around, he was in Johannesburg to see the physio </p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>authorities because he had a frozen shoulder.  On the 27th of May in the early hours, I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>woken up by the knocks and the lights of flashlights right in the house, and I went to open </p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>the door. I saw Mr Venter and Mr Gouws as well as many other policemen, horses, </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>SADF, just full of military.  They entered my house and said they want to search. They </p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>searched my bedroom for UDF documents and took everything.  In their search Mr Venter </p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>asked me where my husband was.  I told them that he was in Gauteng.  He asked this in </p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>Afrikaans and he said, "The day we find him he's going to be in very big trouble."</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a> I was worried and scared but brave at the same time.  I kept quiet looking at him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a> He stood up and said, "What is this bad after all?"  After that they left my house, Matthew </p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>arrived and he said that they had visited all the executive members, taking all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>documents from them.  In April before Fort went to Johannesburg for his physio </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>treatment, he arrived from the UDF meeting at night, I was already in bed and he woke me </p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>up.  He said,"Nomonde, I have to tell you this."  I replied, "Speak".  And he said "WE </p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>were detained with Matthew for a few hours in Port Elizabeth.  We left Sparrow in the car, </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>we left Sparrow because we didn't want the car to be seen, Matthew and I were taken to </p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>SANLAM building in Port Elizabeth.  A security branch section was sitting there waiting </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>for us. There was EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>9 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>one of them who said, 'Lieutanent, can we do it?'  They asked questions after saying this.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>Matthew at the same time was being asked such questions" He was clever enough to tell </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>Fort that one guy.......  (end of tape)  ..... yes he was able to explain and said, "I think they </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>plan something very big about us". We took this lightly but we were unhappy and </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>uncomfortable while we slept.  He kept on thinking about this incident in Port Elizabeth </p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>where they planned this and expressed that he was shocked about what he had heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a> In May, when he was still absent, they didn't want to give him a driver's licence, so </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>he was always escorted by someone,  when he was not there, his younger brother, Robbie </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>was driving for him.  Roy came to inform me and told me and told me that when they </p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>were away with Mr Calata, the police came and stopped them.  He was the driver and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>asked Matthew where Marai is.  He asked who Marai is?  And then they asked Fort if had </p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>forgotten his wife, Fort, sarcastically.  They said, "We will get you again, you and Marai."  </p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>Matthew was cheeky and then he just regarded them and got into the car.  It was in May in </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>MR SMITH:   1985?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes.  On the 27th of June informed me that he and Matthew would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>going for a briefing in Port Elizabeth.  Matthew  came in at about 10 o'clock, he was with </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>Spiro, with Sicelo and Fort was the fourth one.  They went together as usual.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>MR SMITH:   Were they returning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes he mentioned when they'll be coming back because they usually </p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>came back at eight but today he came in at 10 o'clock, but he said also, "We think that </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>we'll be coming very late, maybe at 11 in the evening, I'll be here", EAST LONDON  </p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>9 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>I'm certain about that.   And then this kept on. At 11 I was anxious and unable to sleep </p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>because my husband was not yet back as he had promised.  I knew that he was always </p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>being followed and harassed, even when he went to OK, wherever he went, he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>harassed by the police force.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a> There was a reverend who visited our place during that weekend and I woke up </p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>and felt that I was uneasy.  I went to the reverend's room who was a visitor and said that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>was anxious because my husband had not returned.  He reassured and told me that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>would probably come in the morning because it was very late. Still I felt this was unlike </p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>him as he reports when he is going to sleep over somewhere.  He doesn't just act without </p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>informing me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a> So I kept on, I was awake suffering from insomnia.  When I looked out, there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>a caspar and vans. The casper was on the other street but not a single car moved around as </p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>they usually did.  This was also an indication that something was wrong.  I had this </p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>premonition and I was very expectant at the time.  I still had insomnia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a> The following day I woke up but I was working under pressure because I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>hopeful that probably the reverend's reassurance might be true.  The day went on, Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>Goniwe came to visit in the afternoon and she said and said that she went along to search </p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>for her husband.  We exchanged information and she had been to known places to see </p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>whether her husband had not come back. She went to the Somerset pump station but she </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>was just informed that they had just seen those men at about 12 and they were in a rush. </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>She said she came back after hearing this and she could see that the atmosphere had </p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>changed. If they went out the police were carrying guns and so they rather came back. </p>

<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>10 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a> We started to feel very unhappy and uneasy, we were really in the dark. We slept </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>uneasily on Friday as we did not know what happened to our husbands.  Usually the </p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>Herald was delivered at home because I was distributing it.  During the time that it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>delivered I looked at the headlines and one of the children said that he could see that his </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>fathers car was shown in the paper as being burned.  At that moment I was trembling </p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>because I was afraid of what might have happened to my husband, because I wondered,if </p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>his car was burned like this, what might have happened to him? </p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a> I started distributing the papers as usual, but I was very unhappy.  After a few </p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>hours some friends came in and took me and said I must go to Nyami, who was always </p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>supportive.  I was still 20 at the time and couldn't handle this.  When I got to Nyami's </p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>place Nyami was crying terribly and this affected me also.   (sobbing)</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>MR SMITH:   Mr Chairman, may I request the Commission to adjourn maybe for a </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>minute, I don't think the witness is in a condition to continue at the present moment.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Can we adjourn for 10 minutes please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>OBSERVERS SINGING:    What have we done?  What have we really done?  What </p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>have we done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>MR SMITH:   Mr Chairman, may I be allowed to proceed, please?   Thank you.  Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>Calata, you're ready to go on, are you feeling better? </p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>MR SMITH:   You were still telling us, after you saw in the Herald after the </p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>disappearance of your husband and saw the burned car, that you went to Mrs Goniwe's </p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>house.  Can you please proceed from that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>MRS CALATA:   Well of course, I arrived with other women at EAST LONDON  </p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>11 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>that place.  Mrs Mkhonto was there with us, Mrs Goniwe was also there, people were very </p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>full in the house, and I heard the news that the bodies of Sparrow Mkhonto, and Mhlawuli </p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>have been discovered.  I was wondering what happened to Matthew and Fort.  I went to </p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>my in-laws to stay with them.  Saturday and Sunday passed.  It was now Monday.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a> On Tuesday afternoon we were about to meet Mr Louis Bosolek who was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>attorney of the Seso Centre.  Well we met him at Matthew's place.  While he was talking </p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>to us taking statements, coming to me with Mrs Goniwe he indicated that he wanted </p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>statements about our late husbands.  We didn't accept the fact of our late husbands, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>didn't accept the word, late, because we said that that moment we did not know what </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>happened to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a> When I got home, the reverend from my church visited me.  He had come to </p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>explain that the bodies of Fort and Matthew were found.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a> At that time I had my second child, this child was very close to the father.  After </p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>hearing this news the child was sick, I was pregnant at the time, I left the child that was </p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>inside of me, I don't know what happened to me on that day.   An appointment was made </p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>with the doctor the next day, the thing I did not know was why this appointment was made </p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>so secretively, but when I arrived there, the security police were already there, just where I </p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>stepped in.  I did not know if they were going to look at my condition, but she said to me, </p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>"Sister, you have to clean your face, wipe away the tears and be brave".  And I listened.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>When they saw me they saw a very strong person.  I went to see the doctor and I went </p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>home thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a> The community and the family members went out to </p>

<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>12 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>identify the bodies.  Mr Koluwe, the man we as families </p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>asked to go and identify the bodies, has passed away.  He said that he had seen the bodies </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>but he discovered that the hair was pulled out, his tongue was very long.  His fingers were </p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>cut off.  He had many wounds in his body. When he looked at his trousers he realised that </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>the dogs had bitten him very severely.  He couldn't believe it that the dogs already had </p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>their share.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a> Well the funeral went on, I'm sure the Chairman of this Committee knows the </p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>function, if I remember well, the Chairman was supposed to have attended the funeral.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>After their burial, they were buried on the 20th ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>MR SMITH:   Allow me please.  There is an incident that happened after the funeral, </p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>when the police actually came to your house, I want you to tell the Commission what </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>MRS CALATA:    They were buried on the 20th of July, that time there was a declaration </p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>of a state of emergency.  On the 8th of August I went to deliver my baby Tulani, I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>used to giving birth in the normal way but Tulani was a caesarian. Well I gave birth to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>child and went home the following day.  A few days after the birth of this son, the security </p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>police arrived at home, the leader was Mr Labuschagne, and they said to me, "Don't you </p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>want us to be the father of this child?"  </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a> I kept quiet, I didn't give them an answer.  They waited a few minutes and then </p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>left.  After a few minutes they came back.  They said,"We want to evict you from this </p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>house.  You do not have money to pay for the rent and we know you do not have money, </p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>you took out all your money   </p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>in your bank.  Even in Fort's account there is not a cent </p>

<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>left, so we are here to take you out of the house."    </p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a> I didn't give them an answer or indicate whether I will move out or not. They </p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>repeated that they are here to evict me and I said to them that I am not going to get out of </p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>the house.  They could take a gun and shoot me, but I'm not getting out of the house.  Well </p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>they stood up and they went off.  I asked my next-door neighbour to come and take care of </p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>my children, I went to see my baby sitter and my dad to ask him if he can do anything </p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>about the rent issue.  Well they organised me some money and I stayed in the house.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a> You know that people were so after me that in January 1986, I just decided to </p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>leave Cradock and be far away from there. I went to stay with my friend in Johannesburg </p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>for six months.  Well I came back when I realised that the situation was a bit quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>MR SMITH:   During 1989 there was an inquest into the circumstances surrounding your </p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>husband's death.  Can you recall what the findings of that inquest were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes we had this inquest in 1989 at New Brighton.  The finding was </p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>that, yes the court agrees they were killed but there's not enough evidence as to who killed </p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>them. Now the inquest will never be taken further.  That was the end of it. We stayed at </p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>home with no knowledge until 1994, if I am right.  There was a signal in the New Nation </p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>newspaper.  Then the inquest was reopened. </p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>MR SMITH:   Is that the note where instructions were given for your husband to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>removed from society, your husband and the other three?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes the signal, as I have mentioned, wads written by Mr du Plessis, </p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>through Mr van Rensburg's </p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>instructions, he was also instructed by Brigadier van der EAST LONDON  HEARING</p>

<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>13 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>Westhuizen.  This signal, the three names were there, Fort Calata, Bulela Goniwe and </p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>Matthew Goniwe removed from society as a matter of urgency. I can't remember the date </p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>MR SMITH:   Is it correct that the finding of that inquest was eventually to the effect that </p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>the security forces were responsible for the death of your husband and others?  But it </p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>could not apportion blame either to the army or to the</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>police.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>MR SMITH:  ...(indistinct) your attorneys at the Legal Resources Centre in Grahamstown </p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>to issue summons for damages for loss of support, arising out of the death of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>husband? Is that correct? ...(indistinct) attorneys that that matter is in the process of being </p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>settled by the Government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes that's right.  Last year, if I remember well, it was in February, </p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>Dorothy was just about to start at school, I didn't even have a cent, but there was hope that </p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>this settlement will be finished because we have sent in the claims.  Clive called and said </p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>this will be settled.  This was February last year.  Well we were hopeful that the child will </p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>be able to go to school, Clive came in May, telling me that other documents were needed, </p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>which we gave them and he said that there would surely be a full settlement in June.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>waited and waited.  You know I kept on phoning.  I called Clive in October last year, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>said that they were being delayed by the army department who haven't given them a full </p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>report, but very soon they would complete the settlement. To this day nothing has been </p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>MR SMITH:   Are you referring to Mr Clive Plasket now from EAST LONDON  </p>

<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>MR SMITH:   Did he tell you that the Government has given an undertaking that the cases </p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>are going to be settled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>MR SMITH:   But he's waiting now for the final settlement, and that is since February last </p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>MR SMITH:   Do you want to ask this Commission to attempt to facilitate an expeditious </p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>settlement in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>MRS CALATA:      I'll be very happy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>MR SMITH:   The inquest has made a very general finding about your husband and those </p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>who were responsible for his death.  Would you want to know the identity of the person or </p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>persons who were responsible for your husband's death, and if so, why would you like to </p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>know who exactly killed your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>MRS CALATA:   I'd be very glad to know this person.  If I can know the individuals who </p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>are responsible for this I will be able to understand why they did it.  Most of the time I can </p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>remember that this child, the third born, Tommy does not have a picture of his father and </p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>the last born has no idea at all and they always ask how he was and what he will be doing </p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>at this time.  Tomani, the last born is a child who always wants attention, always wants to </p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>be hugged, and even if he's playing with the other children and talking about the others </p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>who always say that their fathers are coming at a certain time, you'll find that when he </p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>comes back he doesn't know what to say about his father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a> As a mother I always to play the roles of both parents  but I'll be really glad if I can </p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>know what happened so that EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>15 CALATA</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>my children can get an explanation from me, so that I can say it is so and so and so and so. </p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>This will probably make me understand. I do not know the reason for their cruelty, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>just want to know and my family will also be happy to know who really cut short the life </p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>of my husband. Not to say that when they are old I'm just teaching them to retaliate or to </p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>be revengeful, it's just to know who's done this and who changed our lives so drastically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>MR SMITH:   Anything else that you want to ask this Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>MRS CALATA:   Yes there is something that I can request. Because I have these children </p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>that are still at school, they have to survive with inadequate means, even if everything is </p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>worn out they report to me like any other child, "Mama I don't have any shoes any more", </p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>I just ignore them because I know I am unable to do anything about it.  Sometimes they </p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>would say, "Ooh we've at long last got new clothes, I've been wearing these for quite a </p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>long time."  That hurts me very much because I believe that if the father was here, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>would provide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>MR SMITH:   Thank you very much for the evidence.  You have done very well. Mr </p>

<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>you may be unable to answer for me and then a second one.  The first one is, are you able </p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>to tell us the name of the minister who came to your house that day to bring you the news? </p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>And the second question is ...(indistinct) the time that your husband was in </p>

<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>him, did he describe the conditions in the prison to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>MRS CALATA:   It was not a proper, or the person that I know - he was swollen about </p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>the face.  Although he didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>mention that he was assaulted, you could see that he was disfigured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>PANEL MEMBER:   Is that on the second visit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>MRS CALATA:   On the first visit?</p>

<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>MRS CALATA:   On the second visit he was alright but he was very disturbed because he </p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>was expelled from work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>ANOTHER PANEL MEMBER:   I would like to know the name of the bank from which </p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>the money was taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>MRS CALATA:   The Allied Bank in Cradock.  The money was all taken.  No it was us </p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>who had taken it because he was just trying to explain to us, to show us our position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is there anyone who would like to ask a question?  Thank you very </p>

<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>MR SMITH:   Okay I am going to be assisting you, so you don't have to worry.  If you </p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>forget about things, important things, I've got your statement here and I'm going to alert </p>

<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>and recollection, okay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a> Can you tell us something about yourself first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   I am Sindiswe Mkhonto, I was born at Cradock, I studied there, my </p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a>husband is the late Sparrow Mkhonto, he was also born in Cradock, he went to school </p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>there and he worked there. We gave birth to a boy, Nonabo Mkhonto, he is 17 years old </p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>and is now doing standard nine.  Sparrow Mkhonto gave this name to this son after having </p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>a few things.  He was involved in the struggle and he said one day we will really relax.</p>

<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   I got married to Sparrow in 1972.</p>

<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>17 MKHONTO</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>the struggle from 1983.  Cradock during that time, people </p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>were speaking with just one voice. They were fighting the tyrants.  Sparrow was one of </p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a>those people who were elected by the people.  At that time they were actually fighting the </p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a>rents. Sparrow was elected in the second meeting that was there, he became the </p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>chairperson of Cradock area. The organisations were Cradora and the other one at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>time.  Sparrow was working at that time at the Railway, he was not satisfied as he was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>feeling secure.  Sometimes he would be taken from his job and assaulted at SANLAM.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>He would come home in a bad condition.  Sometimes he'd be re</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>moved and detained for two days.  Sometimes I'd go searching for him but to no avail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a>MR SMITH:   You said that Sparrow was working at the railways at the time.  What was </p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>his employers' attitude to his political involvement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   In 1983, when he was working at the railway, his bosses arrived and </p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>called him to their office and said to him that they are releasing him from his duties </p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>because they cannot work with a communist who is busy spreading a bad image, firstly by </p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>calling meetings and gatherings during working hours.  Then my husband left his job.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>was working at a saloon close to SANLAM police offices.  When I was still working, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a>was released late in May. I was also informed that I am dismissed because my husband </p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>was a communist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a> We stayed together unemployed and this affected us very much and he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>dependent for maintenance on his parents who were pensioners.  That time the pension </p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>was available monthly and we were very miserable.  My child was three years old.</p>

<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>occasions by the police?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Sparrow was arrested in 1984.  The police came into our house at </p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a>about twelve.  The police van just arrived, I was with my father and mother in law and </p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a>when I peeped through the door, there were a lot of police around my house. I told my </p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>husband to put on warm attire.  When he was leaving, he carried his identity document.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>gave him warm clothes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a> The policemen knocked at the door and went around the house looking at every </p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>part of it that they could get to.  I ended up going to the door and I met the officer, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>Gali, he pushed me and said he wanted my husband.  I fell down and my husband was </p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a>very shocked and quiet at the time.  We regarded him as a cheeky person and Gali </p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a>continued and terrorised him and said, "You will stop being cheeky!", and he grabbed him </p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>and took him to the police van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a> We stayed for a long time without him. On the second day they didn't inform me </p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a>as to what had happened to my husband.  I went to the offices of Cradora, when I went </p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>there my husband was there in a terrible swollen state, unable to see because his eyes were </p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a>swollen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>MR SMITH:   Did he make a report to you about the condition he was in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Yes he was able to tell me that he was assaulted by the police. </p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a>MR SMITH:    The names of the policemen who assaulted him? </p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Yes he told me it was Venter and Gali.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a>MR SMITH:   Was he detained or arrested after this </p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>19 MKHONTO</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Yes he was detained again for a day. This was fortunate, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a>unlike the others he was arrested for a short period of time, perhaps a day or two. </p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>MR SMITH:   Did he appear to have been assaulted every time he was released by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>MR SMITH:   And did he say to you that he was assaulted by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>MR SMITH:   Now can I take you to the 27th of June 1985.  Can you relate to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>Commission what happened on this day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   On the 27th of June, my husband went together with Matthew </p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>Goniwe, Sicelo Mhlawuli and Fort Calata.  They were going to a meeting in Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>Elizabeth.  They travelled together but he never came back that day.  We waited patiently </p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>but he never came back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>MR SMITH:   Did he tell you when he was going to return on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Yes he told me that he was leaving for Port Elizabeth but he didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>tell me when he would be coming back. He went through and they did not come back the </p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>day they left.  After about two days I saw people coming to my place, his family, my in </p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>laws, Reverend Dano and Geldenhuys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>I was really amazed to see the reverend and asked him what the matter was, because the </p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>house was full of people. </p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a> That time I was informed that my husband was injured.  I was told that he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>found dead together with Sicelo Mhlawuli.  We were taken as families. We went to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>Goniwes.  After a few days, we heard that Matthew Goniwe and Sicelo Mhlawuli as well </p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>were found dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>20 MKHONTO</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a> In 1994, we came from an inquest  ..(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>MR SMITH:   Just before you get you get to the inquest, were you informed by anybody </p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>as to the apparent cause of </p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>death of your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>MR SMITH:   What did the people say to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   The people who came to report said my husband, Mkhonto and </p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>Sicelo Mhlawuli, are dead.  My husband was found at Blue Water Bay together with </p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>Sicelo Mhlawuli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>MR SMITH:   Were numerous multiple wounds on his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   My husband, as I've heard was shot twice in the head and he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a>stabbed and burned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>MR SMITH:   You were about to talk about an inquest that occurred in 1994.  But there </p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>was an inquest earlier than that when no finding could be made as to the identity of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>perpetrators?  Are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>MR SMITH:   And you're also aware of the inquest that was conducted in 1994.  Do you </p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>want to say something about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   In 1994, we went to the first inquest, we came back, there wasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>even a sign of anything that had happened.  The second inquest, the same thing happened.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>But on our return from the second inquest, I tried to clean my yard the next morning.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>While I opened the toilet, I saw something on the toilet floor.  Those were the old toilets </p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>with buckets, I tried to sweep and I felt something heavy. I pulled it out, it was heavy, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>I sat on the stoep and opened this parcel.  It was my husband's I D, every time he went out </p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>he would take his I D with him.  I opened it, I saw it and I was scared.  I wondered how </p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>come my husband's I D is here?  I rushed to the Cradora offices and I explained to EAST </p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>21 MKHONTO</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>them that I found my husband's I D.  After that they said that I should go and report it to </p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a>the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a> Well I went to the police.  At SANLAM nobody attended</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>to me, I spent the whole day there going up and down.  At the end one policeman came to </p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>help me.  I told him how I found this ID that belongs to my husband, and everywhere he </p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>went his ID was on his person.  Now all the police in that office ignored me.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a>suggested that I must leave the ID, they'll try to search and report back to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a>MR SMITH:   Did you leave your ID document with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Yes I left it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>MR SMITH:   Do you remember the name of the policeman that you gave this ID </p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>document to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   I cannot remember their names, they were many in that room, White </p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a>MR SMITH:   In that inquest, the 1994 inquest, the court made a finding that the security </p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>forces are to blame for the death of your husband, but the inquest court could not </p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>apportion blame either to the army or to the police, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a>MR SMITH:   You have also instituted a claim for damages against the government, are </p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a>you also represented by the Legal Resources Centre in Grahamstown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>MRS MKHONTO:  Yes that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>MR SMITH:  What did your attorneys tell you about the status of the case at the present </p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>moment? What did the lawyers say to you, how far has the case gone? </p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   The case really didn't give any direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a>MR SMITH:   ...(indistinct) that the case is about to be settled?  So your case is in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a>same position as that of EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a>21 MKHONTO</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a>Mrs Calata?   Are you also asking the Commission to use its good offices to expedite the </p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>settlement of that particular case?   Can you tell the Commission how this incident, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>death of your husband, how has that affected your life? </p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   After the death of my husband my life never stabilised.  My husband </p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>was everything to me, he did everything for me.  His death was never a pleasant thing to </p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a>me, today I don't have a husband, my child doesn't have a father, I have to answer many </p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a>questions.  Some of the questions I cannot answer.  Today he asks me this question, </p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a>tomorrow the next.  Today I don't have a husband, my son doesn't have a father, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>family has lost.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>MR SMITH:   Nonabo is in school, is he doing standard 10?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Standard nine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a>MR SMITH:   Standard nine, is he doing fine at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Yes he's going well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a>MR SMITH:   Mrs Mkhonto, what else do you request this Commission to do for you, </p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a>how can the Commission assist you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   What I request from the Commission is that I'd like them to make </p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>thorough investigations about this and please establish who did this to my husband.  I do </p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>not </p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>just want them to be exposed, I want them to brought to court so that justice can be done.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>I also would like the Commission to give me a hand in my child's education.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>MR SMITH:   Thank you Mrs Mkhonto.  Mr Chairman that concludes my questioning of </p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, thank you Mama.  Are there any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>DR BORAINE:   Mrs Mkhonto, I just have one question, to assist us to do what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>would like us to do, I need a little more information and it may be that some of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a>EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>22 MKHONTO</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a>colleagues next to you could help you with this as well. You have said that you have made </p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a>a civil case against the State and that no settlement has been reached yet, but you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a>hoping that it will come soon.  You are asking us to try and expedite that.  It would help us </p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>a lot if you could tell us whether the relief you are seeking, has been asked from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a>Department of Justice or from the Department of Defence, or both, or some other </p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>department so that we can try and make contact with them as soon as possible?   Shall I </p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   Yes please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>DR BORAINE:   Sure.  I was saying that one of the requests that you have made to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a>Commission is that we should try and help to bring the settlement, the claim that you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>made, as soon as possible, and we of course, would like to do that but it would help us if </p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>you could tell us against which Department or against which Minister, you are making this </p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>claim, so that we can be in touch with them as soon as possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>MRS MKHONTO:   It is the Army and the Police that I request, both departments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>DR BORAINE:   That's very helpful.</p>

<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>Good afternoon  Mrs Mhlawuli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   Good afternoon Mr Smith.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>MR SMITH:   You are a lecturer at Belville Training College at the present moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   Yes Mr Smith, I've been seconded to Belville Training College as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>lecturer in the new Department of </p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>Xhosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a>MR SMITH:   So are you residing in Belville or Cape Town now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   No we are in Claremont at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>MR SMITH:   Tell us Mrs Mhlawuli, a little bit about yourself, your husband, you're </p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>obviously here to tell, to relate to the Commission the disappearance and subsequent </p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>murdering and killing of your husband?  When did you meet Sicelo for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   I was born in Cradock.  I am Nombuyiselo Zonke.  I attended </p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a>school there at Cradock and Sicelo was attending school at the secondary school. Matthew </p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>was my teacher who was a friend to Sicelo.  When I finished schooling at Cradock, I went </p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>to Mount Isa college where I trained as a teacher.  I came back and worked for a short </p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>period in Cradock.  I went again to Tembasa. At that time Sicelo was working at </p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>Temblabantu High School as a teacher in Zwelitsha.  We struck a friendship which </p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>developed into a relationship but we were not married at the time. We got married in </p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>1980.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a> We were blessed with two children, Bawuli was born in 1976 and Nsika was born </p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>in 1981. The third child, the late </p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>Bantu, was born in 1985.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>MR SMITH:   At the time when your husband was teaching at EAST LONDON  </p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>24 MHLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>Dimbaza, and you were also there at Dimbaza, he had some problems with the then </p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>Ciskeian authorities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>MR SMITH:   Yes it is like that, there at Dimbaza, when he was working Tembalabantu, </p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>the students were striking there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>My brother and his cousins were amongst them as well as my husband.  They were </p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a>arrested and taken into custody in Zwelitsha.  Sicelo went to court and he came back the </p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>following day.  In fact he was called and informed that there was a section of intelligence </p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a>which was headed by Charles Sebe, and this messenger came in and we started to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a>frightened because we knew what was going to follow because of Section R252 under </p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a>which, if you were arrested, you knew that you would be put into detention in Zwelitsha </p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>where the police cells were very cold.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a> At the same time I was afraid and I was putting myself in his boots.  Charles Sebe </p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>asked him what he wanted at that place.  A receipt was taken out and he was told that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a>was going to be watched. He went away from Tambalabantu and came to join me at </p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a>Dimbaza. There is a school there, Atchivelile and he was there.  At the time there were a </p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a>lot of things to do and there were times that we had to do some of the things that we didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>like.  We went to Keiskammahoek and we were obliged to pay certain taxes which we </p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>didn't understand. Because Sicelo didn't want to pay these fees there was a lady who used </p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a>to pay on his behalf because she feared that he would get into trouble.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a> This continued for quite a long time. One day while </p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a>the students from Atchivelile were engaged in unrest, the Ciskeian police came and </p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>assaulted the children while dispersing them, and this they did until there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>injuries.  Sicelo, my husband, took the children to Dimbaza EAST LONDON  HEARING</p>

<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a>25 MHLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a>clinic and this got him into trouble, because the following day, the police came in and took </p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>him into custody where he was interrogated. He was asked why he took the children to </p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a>hospital and he said he was trying to save their lives. He was released but from then on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a>Ciskeian police periodically interrogated him wherever he might be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a> This created a label against him. I was always very frightened when I saw a police </p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a>van, because I would get his clothes for fear that they had come to take him away to those </p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>cold cells.  He would just keep calm but at that time they didn't take him. We discussed </p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a>the matter and felt that we ought to leave Dimbaza and I was highly expectant that June. </p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>In July I started to work as a teacher.  We decided that he should be the one to leave and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a>would keep the home fires burning.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a> The following year I joined him and then in October 1981, I delivered. In 1982 I </p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>went to work at Oudtshoorn.  We worked together for quite a long time. He was my </p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a>principle at the time, so things were quiet for a while, but the times at Oudtshoorn when </p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a>we could realise that we were struggling because it was a very small place.  There was no </p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a>accommodation, you would put up even a shack which we didn't mind as long as we had </p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a>dropped the trail of the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a> When we saw people demolish a house, we took the bricks and tried to extend the </p>

<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   Yes he was involved in politics, there was</p>

<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a>MR SMITH:   This relationship with the others, with Matthew and the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   His friendship with Matthew started some time back, as I said </p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a>before, he was the teacher and in 1976, between '76 and '77, Matthew was arrested in </p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a>Wellington at Umtata.  When he was arrested, Sicelo said that we should go and visit him. </p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a>It was stated that not everyone could go in and as the child was not allowed to enter, I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a>left behind. He was very angry about this because he couldn't see me.  When he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a>released he even told me that the mere fact that I had travelled such a long distance and </p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a>yet couldn't see him, gave him a problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a> At this time I was afraid to refer to him as Matthew, and always called him </p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a>Teacher but at that time I had to do it.  Our friendship started a very long time ago, it didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a>start in 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a>MR SMITH:  Now your husband also went to attend the launch of the UDF, that was in </p>

<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   Yes it is so. At this time, when we were at Oudtshoorn, there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a>the launch of the UDF, we went with some of the people from the nearby places and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a>wanted to observe and be part of it.  So we were happily attending, in fact when we went </p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a>there we hid ourselves because we didn't want to publicise the fact that we were going for </p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a>fear of the police.  When we came back, it was learned that a black police person came </p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>and said that we are public servants and are not supposed to be taking part in politics. This </p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>they  </p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a>said in a very polite manner, trying to influence us not to participate in political issues.</p>

<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a>MR SMITH:   I want you to relate the occasion when his office was destroyed in a fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   At some stage, during all this time he was visited by people who </p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>tried to get him to stop his involvement in  politics because he was going to get into </p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a>trouble. One evening we were woken up and he was told that his office had been burned </p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a>down.  When we went there we confirmed that this had indeed happened, some of his </p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a>belongings were there. As he was studying through UNISA, he would often stay late to </p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a>study.  Nobody knew who had committed the arson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a> There's an incident that took place just before their disappearance and murder. As </p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a>we were friends with Matthew, each holiday we used to go back home in Cradock and go </p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a>via Port Elizabeth to our friend. One day they were in </p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a>Tarkastad at a youth meeting.  When they came back from </p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a>that meeting they were arrested by the police, white police, but they were separated.  So </p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a>nobody knew what was happening between them, for some hours they sat...(indistinct) </p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a>without any explanation.  He was shocked and told us that he had been arrested and gave </p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a>us an account of what had happened, but nobody could explain this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a>MR SMITH:   You used to go to Cradock to your home every </p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a>holiday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   Yes, in June 1985 we went home as usual but EAST LONDON  </p>

<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a>27 MHLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a>this time when they were about to go, on that Monday the 24th I had to go to a winter </p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a>school because I was studying through Vista.  They took me to Port Elizabeth with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a>hope that he'll be coming back and transport me home.  On Tuesday he phoned me to </p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>reassure me that he will come and collect me. On Wednesday there was no telephone call.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>On Thursday when he was supposed to come, still there was nobody.  But because he </p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>would contact me regularly, I was surprised that he couldn't do that this day. My sister-in-</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a>law phoned me and he was unable to tell me where my husband was, but said that he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>on the way to Port Elizabeth when she was making enquiries about him. She just </p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a>reassured me, saying maybe they are coming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a> But it came out that they knew about this disappearance but they were afraid to tell </p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a>me that they have disappeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>MR SMITH:   Just going back a little, when he spoke to you on that Tuesday over the </p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a>telephone, did he mention anything about going to Port Elizabeth, or did he not say </p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a>anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   No he didn't say anything about going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>Port Elizabeth on that particular Tuesday.  So I kept on waiting for him, expecting him, on </p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a>Thursday and he never turned up on Thursday.  And then on Friday I saw a newspaper, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a>read this article that these people were actually missing.  But I thought to myself that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a>must be detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a>MR SMITH:   Was that the article in the Herald.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   The article in the Herald, yes, I thought that they are definitely in </p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a>jail.  So what I needed to do </p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>now  was to go and get him a warm tracksuit and a pair of training shoes and warm shirts </p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a>too.  So I dashed to town EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>28 MHLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a>immediately to get those things. Later on I talked to my sister in law again.  I think she </p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a>was trying to ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a>MR SMITH:   Sorry, just let understand this, I'm sorry to take you back, you actually went </p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a>to buy him shoes and a tracksuit, being under the impression that he's in jail and so you </p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a>were preparing to get some warm clothing for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>MR SMITH:   Okay, proceed please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   On Friday my sister-in-law phoned me to find out if my husband </p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a>was here, I think she wanted to find out how much I knew about his disappearance, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a>when I asked them they again said they didn't know anything. I asked her where the car </p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a>was, and they said it was there as well as the key. I asked my father in law to please </p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a>arrange that I should be taken back home, because I was already anxious, having this </p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>premonition that something has happened. I was fetched by my father-in-law and some of </p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>the friends on that Friday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a> When I got back home, I can't remember very we'll whether it was Saturday or </p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a>Sunday, but when I got back home I found many people there, when there is a reverend </p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a>and people who pray, you immediately know that something terrible has happened.  So I </p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a>fainted and when I came to I was given the bad tidings that they have not come back but </p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>also that their bodies have found.  There is a fisherman who said that he saw the bodies </p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>next to Beacon Bay, but he didn't know what corpses they are.  It was stated that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>were two bodies, the one was next to a red house.  The people from Cradock went to Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a>Elizabeth to make sure about what has happened, they also went to the spot where EAST </p>

<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a>29 MHLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>the bodies were identified. Some were divided, they tried to search for these bodies. </p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a>Amongst them was my brother, Tqobane, and he said that as they were busy searching the </p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>police arrived and asked him what he wanted there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a> He told them that he was just looking for a child who was with him at the beach.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a>They took him into the van.  Now in the van there were prisoners who were carrying </p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a>spades.  Then he asked them what they were going to do with the spades.  They didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>know, they were just instructed to carry spades and to get into the van.  Then he was now </p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a>aware that there was a misunderstanding between them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a> The other group realised that one of them is missing and he tried to put his hand </p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a>through the side of the canopy to wave, but he couldn't do it.  Then they just went off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a> My father-in-law was among the group that was searching for the bodies. And he </p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a>said, "Nolita, my child, I saw a place where they killed my son.  There was something </p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a>very suspicious, there was blood.  It is clear that they killed him, they burned him at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>same place, because I even touched the sand because I wanted to see actually what it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>that was poured on them, and I smelt petrol.  I tried to check there to find rings, belts and </p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>such things but there was nothing of that kind."</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a> They went back home without anything. As it has already been said that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a>fishermen could identify the bodies, they were at the mortuary at New Brighton.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>went there to have a look at the corpses, and I understand that the police were very </p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>difficult, they were pressurising them, they made a guard of honour as people were </p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>proceeding into the house.  I understand there were also remarks.  My father in law had a </p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>look and confirmed that one was Sicelo.  He said the </p>

<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a>condition in which he was in was really shocking. They had burned him terribly. </p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>MR SMITH:   Are you prepared to continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   Yes I'm prepared.  He said, "My daughter, they've killed my son </p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a>bloodily", you know I felt very sorry, I was heartbroken. I went back home, that's the </p>

<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a> My father has never been the same since then.  My mother who was ill at the time, </p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a>became a real cripple because she had a stroke.  My father was talking alone, saying, "The </p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a>Boers killed my son, you Boers killed my son, my real right-hand". My father and mother </p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a>were both on pension and many times would be up and down.  My father was never a </p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a>healthy person since then. </p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a> The second inquest was not yet over when he passed away. My mum also died.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a>Sicelo's brother was very touched by this thing. I asked him why he had lost so much </p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>weight, he said, "Nolita, this has weakened me, it's because every time I would see Sicelo, </p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>this is haunting me". He also passed away.  You know it was death in our family, one after </p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a>the other.  We are now left alone. Now after this second inquest, there were no more </p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a>elderly people, only youngsters.  MR SMITH:   Now I just want to ask you before you go </p>

<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   I read the post mortem documents.  Reading them I was really </p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a>worried, because it has to explain in detail what happened.  I read through and came to </p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a>understand that he had many wounds, in the upper abdomen were five wounds, these </p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a>wounds indicated that different weapons were used to stab him or a group of people </p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>stabbed him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>that they chopped off his right hand, just below the wrist, I don't know what they did with </p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>that hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a>MR SMITH:   There was an inquest, the first inquest that I'm referring to, where there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a>no finding about the perpetrators that were responsible for the death of your husband.  Do </p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a>you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a>MR SMITH:   You also recall that there was a subsequent inquest, where in fact I referred </p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a>to as Mrs Calata and Mrs Mkhonto gave evidence, we have already covered that a finding </p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>was made by the court to the effect that the security forces were responsible.  You also </p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>obviously know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a>MR SMITH:   I'm now going to ask you, the inquest court made certain  general findings </p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a>about your husband, would you want the Commission to use its powers to investigate </p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>further to be able to identify the person or the persons who are responsible?  In other </p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a>words would you like to know who were responsible for the death of your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   I'd gladly love to know the murderers of my husband and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a>should also come to the fore and tell their story and the reason why they committed such </p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a>brutal actions, and I think, in order to be able to achieve, what we are all hoping for, </p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>justice should prevail, the law should take its course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a>MR SMITH:   Is there anything else that you want to request the Commission to do for </p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>you? You're also involved in that court case which the other two have referred to, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a>action EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a>31 MHLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>for damages?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   Yes I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a>MR SMITH:   So I suppose that you'd also request the Commission to use its offices to </p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a>expedite the settlement in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   Definitely, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a>MR SMITH: Is there anything else that you want this Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   If perhaps the Commission can also take care the education of our </p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a>children, because we are here for them and they are also there for us, you know, I think </p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a>their future's quite important, so that they can lead a bright future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a>MR SMITH:   Thank you, you did well.  That concludes my </p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a>questioning of this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much Mr Smith. Any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a>PANEL MEMBER: Yesterday I asked a question and it is the same question that I'm </p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a>going to ask now. I was asking about this man whose wrist was mutilated, and also where </p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a>Webber was also injured during the Highgate issue.  If these perpetrators can explain and </p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a>give an account and what would you do if they would request amnesty after the </p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a>Commission has cross-questioned them, and then if the Commission realises that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a>have expressed their views and also giving their explanation for committing these </p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a>brutalities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a>And what if the Commission is satisfied that this explanation is satisfactory and it decides </p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a>to offer amnesty, what do you say about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   The fact that they should be excused?  I'm still moved, and I do not </p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a>want to lie, because my family have suffered extremely from this.  My children were </p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a>EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a>32 MHLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a>extremely affected. We have been miserable for quite a long time and it was difficult to </p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a>guide my child alone as a woman without the support of my husband, especially during </p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a>this period when the child is an adolescent.  Even if I say these people should be given </p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a>amnesty, it wont return my husband, but that hand, we still want it.  We know we have </p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a>buried them, but really to have the hand which is said to be in a bottle in Port Elizabeth, </p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a>we would like to get the hand.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a>SECOND PANEL MEMBER:   Mrs Mhlawuli, you have given an account of what has </p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a>happened to your husband, this was terrible, and it is the way in which your husband, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>Goniwa and his friends were brutally exposed to torture, and I was very moved by what I </p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a>heard from you. All these gentlemen were known to me and this moved me and I am very </p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a>affected by what has happened to them. The speaker in Parliament, we were moving </p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a>together, going visiting with the speaker there. If I can just ask two questions, where did </p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a>you obtain the account which I was given, is there any information which you obtained </p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a>from the fisherman. Is there any other indication that you can know who the fisherman </p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a>was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   No cannot give full information of his name, maybe my friends </p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a>would remind me who he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a>ONE OF THE ACCOMPANYING WITNESSES:  We are not too sure but according </p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a>to the documents of the inquest which has recently been held, because it was confirmed </p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a>that the bodies were found by this fisherman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is there any problem?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a>WITNESS:  We don't have a problem. Even if we don't know the name of the fisherman. </p>

<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a>33 MHLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a>SECOND PANEL MEMBER:  Can I ask another question?  When you were given details </p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>about what happened, you said your brother who is available, who is present now, when </p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a>they went to go and search for your husband, the policemen who came arrested him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   Yes that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a>SECOND PANEL MEMBER: Did they explain why they were arresting him, or is </p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a>there any policeman who was there at the time and arrested him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a>MRS MHLAWULI:   I don't know whether there was somebody who knew about him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a>They didn't even explain at the time because they just grabbed you and pushed you into </p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a>the van </p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a>and no explanation was given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a>SECOND PANEL MEMBER: Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>MR SMITH:    If I may just before you allow the witnesses to step down, Mrs Mhlawuli's </p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>daughter, Bawuli Mhlawuli, has made a request, that she wants to make a short brief </p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a>statement to the inquest, so I please ask you to allow her the opportunity to do so.  Thank </p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a> Can I ask for the witness to be sworn or does the Chairperson think that it's not </p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a>necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a>DR BORAINE:   Good afternoon it's nice to see you again and I'm glad you got this </p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a>opportunity. I have to ask you to take the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a>MISS MHLAWULI:  (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a>DR BORAINE:    It's not very easy, we have listened to harrowing stories, including the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>story of your father, but I hope you'll feel very relaxed and that you'll tell us what is in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a>your heart.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a>MR SMITH:   Hello Bawuli, unfortunately I have to ask you your age, I know it's not very </p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a>kind.  How old are you now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a>EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a>34 MHLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a>MISS MHLAWULI:   I'm nineteen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a>MR SMITH:   How old were you when your father died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a>MISS MHLAWULI:   I was about eight and my brother was three. MR SMITH:   And </p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a>your little brother, how old was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a>MISS MHLAWULI:    Three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a>MR SMITH:   Now you have requested an opportunity to address the Commission, and in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a>particular you wanted to  tell the Commission how your father's death, what effect it had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a>on your lives, when you were still staying in Oudtshoorn.  And you have informed me that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a>you wanted to relate the harassment that took place after your father's death, and the way </p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a>in which your mother was treated by  policemen, and in particular also the reaction of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a>your younger brother to this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a>MISS MHLAWULI:   Well at the time I was very young, but I just happen to remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a>some of the things that happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a>MR SMITH:   If you feel that you are not ready to give evidence now or that you're not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a>strong enough, I can ask the Commission to give you an opportunity tomorrow, Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a>Goniwe is still going to give evidence on this matter, so if you feel that you are not strong </p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a>enough, then you must just say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a>MISS MHLAWULI:    No it's alright, I will continue. After my father's death, we went </p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a>back to Oudtshoorn, that's where my mother was teaching. There was this particular </p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a>morning when we were all sleeping in one room, (end of tape )</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a>.....they would just kick it open you know, and my mother just thought there was nothing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a>else she could do, she just went to open the door.  She led them into the house and as usual </p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a>they came in and were searching for things that we didn't know.  They came across one </p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a>big poster titled Freedom EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a>34 MHLAWULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a>Now, and they took it. And they saw some sympathy cards from people who were very </p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a>sympathetic and sent the stuff from all over the world, and this one policeman whose </p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a>name was Kroeter, he came across those and he was making fun of them saying, "Dit is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a>die kaarte van die doeie man", and they were kind of making a joke out of it, out of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a>death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a> After that, this man Kroeter was like harassing my mother, he was screaming and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a>yelling at her, asking whose belongings are these, why does she say everything belongs </p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>to my father?  And my mother said, because the stuff does belong to him, and he doesn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>necessary do what he does with her, because he was like barking, like talking to a dog. My </p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a>mother said, "I'm a human being, so are you, so you don't need to speak the way you do."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a> This man said, "The truth will come out one day", and that was very ironic </p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a>because here we are today in the Truth Commission talking about this truth.  And I mean I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a>never expected him to say that because the truth that is coming out is based on him now, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a>not us, we're the victims. He's the one that committed all this pain to us, you know.  And </p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a>after that my mother said, "I agree with you very much, I strongly agree with you, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a>truth is definitely coming out one day". And this man sat down, and for once ever since he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a>entered the door, he sat down and he asked my mother if he could smoke.  My mother </p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a>said, "Okay fine, he could smoke".  He lit a cigarette and he sat down and smoked.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a>looked quite withdrawn after that. And they had arrived at our around about 12 midnight, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a>and now it was around about six in the morning. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a>MR SMITH:   So they were there for the whole evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a>MISS MHLAWULI:   For the whole evening.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a>MR SMITH:   Kept you out of sleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a>MISS MHLAWULI:  Yes, and we never got to go back and sleep, we just had to get </p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a>ready to go to school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a>MR SMITH:   How old was your younger brother at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a>MISS MHLAWULI:   He was three years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a>MR SMITH:   Three years, how was he affected by this. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a>MISS MHLAWULI:  We used to go to town with my mother or just go out, but my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a>brother, immediately he saw the policeman, or a white person, or he saw whoever was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a>non-black, he would say, "Here are these dogs who killed my father".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a>MR SMITH:   Mabaluwa, what would you ask the Commission to do for you.  Are you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a>interested to know the identity of the person or persons who are responsible for the death </p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a>of your father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a>MISS MHLAWULI:   Well before I come to your question, I'd just like to thank my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a>principal, Mr Idiessi, because after we stayed in Oudtshoorn, we all moved to Cape Town </p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a>because my mother, at the time of my father's death had registered to study further with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a>my father.  But then she went on alone without my father, and when we got to Cape Town </p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a>I had to go to a certain school, according to the province that we encountered.  So the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a>school was quite expensive and my mother couldn't afford it, but my principal, Mr Idiessi </p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a>was so kind and understanding, he let me stay at the school and when my mother wanted </p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a>to take me out he wouldn't let her because I would get very frustrated at any other school, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a>so I stayed.  Then at the end of Matric, last year, Mr Gran, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a>isn't here today, he organised a scholarship for me, and I'm very grateful to him.        </p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a> Well, answering the question, the people who did this to us have done something </p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a>very cruel that nobody would ever EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>

<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a>MR SMITH:   Would you like to know the identity of these persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a>MISS MHLAWULI:   I would love to know who killed my father, so would my brother, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a>suppose, because it's very hard for us right now to do anything, because in order for us to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a>forget, and forgive, we do want to forgive, but I mean I don't know what to say, we do </p>

<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a>know.  And I must say we're all upset about this. It's been a loss, a big loss too because my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>mother has to play two roles, a mother role and a father role, and I like to say, I'm very </p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a>proud of her.  She's been very good.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a>MR SMITH:   Thank you, Mabaluwa, thank you very much.  That concludes my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a>questioning Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a>PANEL MEMBER: My question is going to be directed to all three, in fact all four </p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a>families. If it were possible for the Commission to facilitate the something that should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a>done to remember all four families, since this was a so-called group killing, do you think </p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a>that as families you could get together and provide some ideas as to what you think we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a>should do to facilitate something to remember the four?  You don't have to tell us now </p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a>what you would like us to do.  But it's just the idea, do you think it would be a good idea? </p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a>As a group killing that you want to commemorate, the four families get together and think </p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a>of something that could be done to remember the families as a group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a> In fact I've just been indicated to that  perhaps when you talk tomorrow, Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a>Goniwe, you will have put your heads together and you possibly will know then, what it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a>that EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a>37</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a>you'd like to have. I just wanted that to be told to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a>ARCHBISHOP TUTU:   I wanted to say this when Miss Mhlawuli was here but perhaps I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a>should speak and you will tell her. I said after Mrs Mazwai that I was deeply proud of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a>fact that I was black and that we had people of her calibre.  We are proud to have people </p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a>like you and your husbands and the reason why we won the struggle, is not because we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>had guns, we won the struggle because of people like you. People of incredible strength, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>and this country is fortunate to have people like you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a> And I wanted to say to your daughter, that her father where he is looking down, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>proud of her, and you should feel you've done a tremendous job with her, that in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a>anguish which she is feeling, she can have the graciousness that she showed in expressing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a>appreciation for what Dr Boraine and the principal of the school have done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a> We have a tremendous country, which has got tremendous people, and you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a>one example of why we make it in this country. And that she, your daughter should say, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a>want to forgive, we want to forgive, after what she has experienced, and seen what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a>happened to her mother and to her father, and she says, we want to forgive, but we want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a>know who to forgive.  We give thanks to God for you, and thank you for your contribution </p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a>to our struggle, and thank you, even if it was reluctant in a sense, rightly, thank you for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a>sacrificing your husbands.</p>
