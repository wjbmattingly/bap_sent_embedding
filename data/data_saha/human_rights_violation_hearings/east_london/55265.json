When I got to the office there were White men from CBA and Cambridge.  They called me inside.  They told me to go with them to Cambridge.  I said to them that I left my jacket in the locker.  They told me to go with them as I was.  We went at about three and there was another worker who was taken with that car.  When we were near the John Vorster Bridge, one White man said that I had a link with a banned organisation.  I did not answer that.\n We got to Cambridge.  There was an album in Cambridge.  He paged through this album looking for a particular person, but he did not find the photograph of this person.  He then took me to a Ford Sierra.  He told me to put my duster coat in my face.  When we passed Highgate I peeped through, because I wanted to know where they were taking me to.  They were talking with each other at the time.  What I forgot is that when they did not the photograph in that album they said that I am going to tell them the truth in Mdantsane.  When we got to Mdantsane they were angry and they dragged me and they were pushing me towards the burglar proofs in Cambridge.",
