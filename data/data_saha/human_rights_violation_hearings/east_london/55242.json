            "Alright.  In 1990 we received tickets from the Border Council of Churches because we requested to go to my brother's grave.  We left on a Thursday evening and got to Johannesburg where we were going to take a flight on the Friday morning to Botswana.  We had been promised that there would be people who would meet us at the airport however there was nobody.\n We tried to phone the ANC Headquarters and told them that nobody had come to meet us at the airport and we requested help.  They said that they'd sent two people from Lusaka but these two people had been arrested by the Botswana Security Branch because they had no visas and were told to go back to Lusaka.  They then said they would phone somebody from Botswana to organise accommodation for us and we went to a motel.   This man said he was scared because the ANC had been banned in Botswana.  This person said he would organise a lady from Botswana, a lady that my brother and his girlfriend  had been staying with.  It was these people who were going to take us to my brother's grave, but nobody came the whole of Friday and on Saturday morning we phoned Lusaka again asking for help.  We needed direction and we had no money.  It was the ANC that promised that everything would be organised.  My aunt knew somebody who lent her some money and we tried to buy some food at the motel.  \n Late on Saturday ANC men who were in the underground structure came to us and told us to wait for a lady that was going to come and tell us everything.  I said that I didn't even want to know what happened, all I wanted was to see my brother's grave.  The report then was that if the Botswana police found out that we were ANC people, our lives would be in danger.  Sunday morning I phoned Lusaka and they told us that Comrade Chowa was on his way from Lusaka.  He apparently used public transport to come down.  Sunday evening these people arrived, Chris was his name.  \n The following morning we were supposed to go with them to the grave.  I begged them for information and the one tried to tell me that Comrade Thembisile died in a way that they too could not explain.  They said they found him in his room and he'd already passed away.  His gun was in his hand and he was under a mattress.  What shocked them about the situation was that nobody was allowed to go to his funeral except for three people who were allowed to attend, the Priest, his landlady and his girlfriend.  All I wanted was to go to the graveyard.  \n Late on Monday Chowa who was an exile phoned, he was in the Botswana Sun Hotel and he came to our motel and told us that he arrived in Botswana on the Sunday, the police arrested him and interrogated him with regard to our presence in Botswana as well as his presence.  We thanked Chowa and came back to South Africa on the Tuesday not having found anything about my brother and not having seen his grave.",
