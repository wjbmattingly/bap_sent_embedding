I went home, and just at the entrance \npolice took me, and put me into their cars. I tried to shout to my dad that I am being taken \nby the police, because I could see him in the distance.  At the police station, the head of \nthe police asked to see my identity document.  I gave them my document with the hope \nthat  I may see my husband.  At that time I was carrying a so-called Coloured ID. They \nasked me, if I am going to vote now for the tricameral parliament.  Before I could answer \nthat question, they said that they knew that I could not even vote, because they knew that \nI'm a member of the ANC.  I never gave them an answer, I just kept quiet.  \n They were now threatening me, saying, \"Your children long to see their father, \nhey, they will never see him\".  And I asked them what child doesn't want to see his or her \nfather?  They told me that I will never ever be employed in Cradock.

I knew that he was always \nbeing followed and harassed, even when he went to OK, wherever he went, he was \nharassed by the police force.  \n There was a reverend who visited our place during that weekend and I woke up \nand felt that I was uneasy.

But then she went on alone without my father, and when we got to Cape Town \nI had to go to a certain school, according to the province that we encountered.  So the \nschool was quite expensive and my mother couldn't afford it, but my principal, Mr Idiessi \nwas so kind and understanding, he let me stay at the school and when my mother wanted \nto take me out he wouldn't let her because I would get very frustrated at any other school, \nso I stayed.  Then at the end of Matric, last year, Mr Gran, \nisn't here today, he organised a scholarship for me, and I'm very grateful to him.        \n Well, answering the question, the people who did this to us have done something \nvery cruel that nobody would ever EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/",
