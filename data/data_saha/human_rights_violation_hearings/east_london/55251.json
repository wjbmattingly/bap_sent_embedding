            "Thank you Reverend.  Let me greet you Reverend and people in \nthe panel together with everybody present here.  I would like to thank this opportunity, \nI was given this opportunity after Sisan Jikilane, who was testifying here, he was my \nleader in the trade union.  Chairperson, I am not going to say a lot, but I will just tell \nyou briefly what happened.  I am worried, because I was supposed to testify yesterday, \nbut because of the situation here in Mdantsane I could not testify yesterday.  My \nspeech would make sense if I testified yesterday, because yesterday was women's day. \n Women in South Africa have struggled.  That is what I wanted to say yesterday.  I \nwanted to clarify this.  \n Women were involved in the struggle.  They started in the bus boycott and in \nthe trade unions.  Because it was very difficult for us to be involved in the struggle we \nhad to form different other organisations.  We did not want to depend on the trade \nunion only.  We formed our own committees.  We were going to be joined to the \ncommunity organisations.  We started with UWO, United Womens' Organisation, \nwhich was a national organisation.  We worked together with the trade union, because \nwe were also workers.  We wanted to be liberated.  This is, this was our strategy.  We \ncontinued as UWO as women and we supported the bus boycott.  \n At that time in the Committee of Ten, I was one of the members.  There were \nonly two women in that committee.  Eight of the other members were men.  We \ncontinued in this committee.  I am not, I do not want to talk a lot about the bus \nboycott, because Sisan has already given you that information, but what I would like \nto say is that we were fighting against the increase of five cents.  They called it 11%.  \nWe as workers, we were not aware of this 11%, but we found out that the difference \nwas five cents.  People were killed, Chairperson.  I am here today, because I want to \ntestify on that.  People were shot.  I heard about this while I was in prison, because in \n1983 I was detained in NU1.  \n The bus boycott started on the first of July.  On the second day people were \nsupporting the bus boycott and the leaders of that bus boycott were detained.  The \naim, Chairperson, was that as the leaders were being detained people would go and \nuse the busses, because they thought that the leaders were the ones stopping people \nfrom using busses.  We were detained as members of the Committee of Ten in NU1 \ntogether with other members of SAWU, who were suspected to be the ones \nsupporting the bus boycott.  People were strong and they knew where we were \ndetained.  The police would come to our cells, Chairperson.  They would tell us that \nthe bus boycott was over.  I would say that, we would say that they were not telling us \nthe truth.\n I was amongst these men.  Everybody who was a leader was arrested at that \ntime.  Chairperson, we were inside at the time.  I would like to repeat that people \nsupported the bus boycott.  The leaders were all inside, they were arrested.  I became \nill in the prison cell.  After I ate my meal, as the detainees, as detainees we would eat \nfood from different hospitals and on this particular day all the leaders were there and \nTangana was also there.  After we had our meal, Chairperson, there was chaos.  We \nwanted, everybody wanted to go to the loo after we had this meal.  Because we were \nmore than 15, because Comrades were more than 15 in the cell they would go to one \nloo.  Fortunately, I was alone in the cell.  I became ill and they decided to take me to \nhospital.  In hospital my family members were not allowed, because I was a detainee, \nbut the workers would come to visit me in hospital and they would want information \nof whether there are any leaders who died there.\n Chairperson, as the Committee of Ten we were disturbed, because people \nwere being shot outside and some of them disappeared.  Today, on behalf of the \nCommittee of Ten, when I am concluding the bus boycott issue, I would like to say the \nvictims family members of the bus boycott massacre would not be satisfied, \nChairperson, unless someone would come forward to tell us what happened, because \nif you are a leader and such incidents are happening, you are also affected.  The people \nwho were against our organisation said that we were the ones who made people killed. \n When I am concluding the bus boycott issue I would like to ask the Committee to \npersuade the perpetrators to come forward to tell the truth so that the victims and their \nfamily members can be satisfied.  They must come here and apologise and I would like \nthe Commission to speak to the President so that we can have projects in our area and \npeople can get pension grants.  It is difficult for the victims, those who were injured to \nget the grant.  If the Commission can help them so that they get the pension grant.  \nThe Commission can come to us and ask the names of these people.  We do have \nrecords although they were burnt down when SAWO offices were burnt down.\n Chairperson, I would also like to talk about the struggle of school children \nespecially what happened in Mdantsane in 1986.  We were different structures and we \nwere trying to discuss this.  Women organisations were there.  We had women's \norganisations which were strong in East London.  We also had an, DUWEL \norganisation and ELWA, East London Womens Association and Democratic Union of \nWomen of East London.  These two organisations would be present when \nnegotiations took place.  \n In 1986 we were harassed as women.  In all the mentioned occasions women \nwere the ones who were harassed the most.  In the case, in the incident of bus boycott, \nin 1983 I was in hospital.  I was assaulted in the police station in NU1.  In 1984 I went \nback to hospital for six weeks, because I was also assaulted.  I think I was assaulted, \nbecause I had connections with the ANC and it was banned at that time.  Members of \nthe Committee of Ten were harassed by the people, because people said that these \nmembers sold me out.  I use to go to Lesotho.  We did not want the bus boycott to \nhave anything to do with the ANC.  I denied everything and I denied the evidence by \nthe police.\n They then assaulted me.  I urinated myself and my ears were burning.  They \nput a tube.  This was used by the Security Branch when a person would be \ninterrogated.  They would tie this tube in your neck so that you could not breathe.  \nThey would say to you if you want us to put, to take off this tube, you will tell us the \ntruth and tie, the tube was tied in your neck.  The police would say that if you are \nready to tell us the truth, raise your hand.  After five minutes I would raise my hand \nand say, yes, I am going to tell you the truth and they would take off this tube.  I \nwould say, yes, I am going to tell you the truth.  I do go to Lesotho and I come back.  \nWhat else do you want?  I am not going to, I do not want to talk more about that.  \n At that time I was a leader, but I would like to tell you what the police use to \ndo to us.  I was imprisoned with my friend Mtze, it was four of us in totality.  We were \nwoken up early in the morning by the prisoners to be interrogated at unit one, \nMdantsane.  The interrogation was led by White men.  The team was led by Charles \nvan Wyk.  There was a whole lot of them.  So therefore the team that was torturing us \nand the team that was interrogating us was different.  They therefore had particular \nspecific job to beat people up, to torture people.  This is the Black people, our own \npeople that were torturing us.  When I had urinated on myself, all wet, I woke up from \nthat, my tracksuit was wet as well.  \n They sent in my friend, Mtze, so that I could see how much he had been \nbeaten up.  He said to us if you continue not to divulge the truth you are going to die \nhere.  He said to me that Mtze was beaten up, because I was not divulging anything.  I \nsaw that they would say that they would beat us up until we mess on ourselves.  My \nfriend had messed on himself, I noticed.  I said to him that perhaps we should tell them \neverything, but we decided not to.  We said to them that they must beat us up to \ndeath, it is alright.  He said the same thing.  I would hear him screaming, crying from \nnext door and he would hear me as well.  These were huge, hefty men that were \nbeating us up, you must realise.\n Mr Chairperson, Madam Chair, the most important thing I want to say about \nwomen's struggle for liberation.  Nhononho ...",

            "Reverend, people were beaten up.  It was painful.  Women cried \nout, they screamed, but there was no mercy.  You would think that when a woman \ncries out, praying, mercy would be found.  We prayed, but got no mercy.  I was also \nbeaten up Mr Chairperson.  I was beaten up such that I had a terrible wound on my \nhead that I was temporarily blind.  The women stood strong.  The car I was driving \nwas packed with women.  When we were next to Elwoody with women bleeding, the \ntraffic cop stopped my car.  The traffic cops stopped our car.  They said that I did not \nhave a licence.  I told them I had a learner's licence.  They said that I could not do that. \n I told them that we were bleeding, injured.  They refused.  We got out as women, \npushed them out of the way and got back to the car and we told them that they would \nget us at the hospital.  As women we were very oppressed.  Our rights were violated, \nbut we got to the hospital.  \n Mr Chairperson, I said that I was not going to be long.  I just wanted to reveal \nthat as women we contributed to the struggle.  I want to request the Committee, \nhowever, that, well it is going to take a report before the President, especially in \nconnection with the bus boycott victims, something should be done for the people.  \nPeople's families, children belonging to the victims.  There should be some form of \nfund to educate, to pay for their education.  We would appreciate that peoples' bodies \nbe exhumed and people be given their full rights to bury their own people that \ndisappeared.  Children that were injured, most of them were not able to continue with \ntheir education.  These are the battles of COSAS.  They should be, people should \nendeavour to help these people.  \n I went to the Border Training Centre and found out that if the Government \nwould help certain organisations and women so that people could be trained.  There \nare knitting machines, sewing machines and there are other ways to help people \nespecially with their skills so that people can forgive and people can let go of the \nbitterness they feel towards Sebe's regime.",
