<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  We will ask Vuyani Mngaza to come forward. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>ADV SANDI:  Number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Number ten in our list.  Welcome Vuyani Mngaza.  You will be </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>sworn in by Reverend Xundu so that you can give your evidence under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>VUYANI MNGAZA:  (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>REV XUNDU:  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Sandi will lead you in evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>ADV SANDI:  Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Mngaza, your story goes back a long </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>way, from 1960, actually 1963, being tortured, being ill-treated, you lost your </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>business.  We were in great debt and so forth.  Let us start as thus, Mr Mngaza.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>were a PAC member in 1963?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>ADV SANDI:  Arrested because you were active in the PAC military wing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>ADV SANDI:  Bhoqo, was it a PAC wing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>ADV SANDI:  Let me hand over to you.  Could you tell us your story without </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>interruption.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Thank you Mr Chairperson.  In our, I will start with the 1963 </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>incident so that we can hurry.  I was arrested on the eighth of April 1963, arrested in </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>the morning at two am, having completed a task force function in the Transkei.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>were all over Transkei, but the Security Branch officers were following us.  We got to </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>my business place.  Some Comrades were left behind.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>ADV SANDI:  Are you talking about your garage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes, Pan African Motors at that time.  My duty, especially in </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>underground operations of the PAC, I had to co-ordinate our activities from Maseru </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>to Cape Town.  As I had a business they would send the Comrades to me.  I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>help them as much as I could in whatever they needed.  We did a lot of work in my </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>garage, making firearms, because as PAC members we were going to start a </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>revolution in 1963.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>ADV SANDI:  Without disturbing you, what kind of weapons are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Pangas and weapons that were going to damage the Security Forces, </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>because we were going to fight them.  We wanted to liberate our people from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>oppression of the Boers.  We did our work.  We had to co-ordinate sending weapons </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>all over.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>ADV SANDI:  You were arrested in that process?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Donald Card came at two am.  He arrested me from home.  Some, </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>he missed some Comrades that were in my garage sleeping.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>ADV SANDI:  Is this the time you ended up in a seven month detention in </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>Cambridge?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>ADV SANDI:  In those seven months did you go before the Court of Law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes, twice actually.  They kept on postponing the case until we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>granted bail.  There were other Comrades that I had worked with.  They divided us.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>was in solitary confinement.  My, the charge was then withdrawn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>ADV SANDI:  You were re-arrested.  When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>MR MNGAZA:  After my case had been withdrawn I was led by Card to a 90 day </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>detention.  The Law had just been established.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>ADV SANDI:  Are you saying that you were the first victims of the 90 day detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes, we were the first victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>ADV SANDI:  What happened at the 90 day detention?  Could you tell us about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>form of torture you experienced.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>MR MNGAZA:  After they had taken me from Fleet Street Charge Office I was taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>to the Cambridge Police Station.  On the way, it was Sergeant Card who was in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>car.  I do not remember the others, but I think Scheepers was there.  They asked me to </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>work with them.  They offered me everything including a passport.  I said I could not </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>do that.  Nobody was ever a policeman at home.  I was not going to be a policeman.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>They put me in solitary confinement in Cambridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>ADV SANDI:  How long were you detained Mr Mngaza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>MR MNGAZA:  I was in solitary confinement for a week.  They would call me in </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>during that week.  They would interrogate me in connection with the work we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>doing.  They were not satisfied, because I was not divulging anything.  They were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>pleased at all.  On the second week I was taken to the Charge Office, taken by Donald </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>Card together with four other policemen, White policemen.  There was a fifth one, a </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>Black man, Chikila.  I was interrogated on that day.  Taken to another room in front, </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>ahead of the interrogation office.  They kicked me into the room.  I was assaulted on </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>that day.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>ADV SANDI:  The doctor you saw whilst in detention, what was his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Before I was taken to the doctor, because this doctor I was taken to </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>was from Queenstown Mental Hospital.  After I had been beaten up I was charged at </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>Fleet Street.  They said that I had hit policemen.  What is strange, the Magistrate never </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>asked why my face was so swollen up.  He just committed me to Dubangeni Mental </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>Hospital in Queenstown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>ADV SANDI:  Had you made a request to the Magistrate that you want to be sent to </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>Dubangeni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>MR MNGAZA:  No, they just said that the police said that because I was in solitary </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>confinement I went insane and I fought the police.  Therefore, they said that I was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>mentally stable, I was deranged, this is why I was supposed to have fought the </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>policemen.  I was examined by a doctor, I was not examined by a doctor, I was just </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>sent to Dubangeni Hospital for 28 days.  It is there that I was examined by a doctor </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>from the mental hospital.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>ADV SANDI:  Who was the Magistrate presiding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>MR MNGAZA:  I did not know him even then, but I remember at the time, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>should be available at, in the records.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>ADV SANDI:  I would like to hear more about this Dubangeni business.  You were </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>sent to this hospital, a hospital for the mentally deranged, because you fought against </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>the police?  You were discharged from Dubangeni.  Did you go to any legal </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>representative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Before long Dr Robbinson realised that I had been beaten up by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>Boers.  He said that he would not make me stay there, because I was clearly not </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>mentally ill.  I had just been beaten by the Boers.  They said, he said that they should </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>leave a security man, because they are not going to keep somebody who is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>deranged.  He wrote a report that I had been beaten up already, because he did not see </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>any, could not detect any mental illness.  My attorney, Kannemeyer from </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>Grahamstown, wrote to the Security Police that I should be taken back to Stutterheim </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>Prison for detention to complete my detention period.  I was taken into a cell with a lot </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>of lice.  I spent two nights there.  They took me from there back to Cambridge Police </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>Station.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>ADV SANDI:  Did they beat you up again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>MR MNGAZA:  No, what happened is they took me again to court and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>withdrew the charges of assault.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>ADV SANDI:  Did you take any steps claiming, because you had been ill-treated by </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes, after the 90 day detention.  On the 19th day I was called and </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>released.  I laid a charge opening a civil case, having been harassed and assaulted by </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>the security.  Nothing came of this case, because they were handling it in any case.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>ADV SANDI:  In 1964 you made a request for a passport to leave the country.  Are </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>you, were you talking about an exit permit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes, I applied for a passport.  They refused.  I, when I wanted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>find out what the reasons were for the denial they would not disclose them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>ADV SANDI:  Then in 1967 you were arrested for sabotage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes, I was arrested again for sabotage, membership of the PAC, </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>suppression of communism.  There were a lot of charges laid, a long list it was.  I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>taken to the Supreme Court in Grahamstown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>ADV SANDI:  You were in detention for three months</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes, solitary confinement in Grahamstown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>ADV SANDI:  When you appeared in court you were sentenced.  What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>MR MNGAZA:  My case lasted a week.  It was supposed to have lasted longer as </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>there were many charges.  However, it collapsed after the first week, because of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>cross-examination made to the chief witnesses.  It was evident that lies were told about </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>ADV SANDI:  Therefore you were innocent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes, I was acquitted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>ADV SANDI:  After that, you left in 1967?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes, I had to get an exit permit, because I could not get a passport.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>Fortunately when we were in Grahamstown we smuggled documents to the United </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>Nations and my name was in the list of South African cases that were on at the time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>The Senegal Government said to the French Embassy in East London to give me a </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>political asylum in Senegal as I was in the list for the oppressed in South Africa, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>tortured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>ADV SANDI:  So you were in Senegal and other countries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes, from there I went to Senegal where my organisation said I must </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>open an office.  From there I went to Nigeria, to Tanzania.  From Tanzania I went to </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>Europe.  I stayed in London.  I covered the whole of Europe, Iceland and </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>Scandinavian countries working for the organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>ADV SANDI:  You came back in 1992 without a wife or children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>MR MNGAZA:  Yes, I came back alone.  I am still alone.  It was difficult to bring </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>back my family, because I have no place to stay.  It is difficult to bring back a family if </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>you have no place to stay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>ADV SANDI:  You have a request about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>MR MNGAZA:  If the Commission could help me with accommodation so that my </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>family can come back.  They cannot come back.  Secondly, I do not know if I should </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>proceed. </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>ADV SANDI:  Yes, you may proceed.  Have you applied for a special pension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>MR MNGAZA:  That is what I was going to talk about.  I have applied for a special </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>pension last year, but there has been no response.  If the Commission could help me </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>and urge them along.  It is my sister only to help me.  I do not have transport either.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>Secondly, that the Commission could help me, I need to exhume my son's body who </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>passed away in Botswana working for the organisation.  He died in 1992.  I need for </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>him to be buried at home.  Fourthly, I think something should be done for freedom </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>fighters in terms of a heroes acre.  Our people are all over the African Continent, some </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>even in Europe.  If they could be exhumed and buried so that people may be able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>see their late family members who had fought for liberation.  I think that would help </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>people if the TRC could help as well as it is quite expensive.  It is expensive to exhume </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>peoples' bodies, but it should be done as a tribute to the fallen heroes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>ADV SANDI:  You lost a lot.  You lost your business, you lost your family, your </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>family is all over the world.  I am going to, however, hand you over to the Chairperson </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>now.  Maybe he has questions for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you for your story.  Mrs Crichton will read a statement </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>from Mr Card.  It is a long statement.  I will ask her to hurry.  There are a lot of people </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>still to come.  You may step down.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Thank you Mr Chairperson.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a> "I the undersigned, Donald John Card, do hereby state </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>I am retired, 68 years of age and reside at 5 Avon </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>Road, Woodleigh, East London.  On the 22nd of May </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>1997 I was handed a document from the Truth and </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>Reconciliation Commission in terms of Act number 34 </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>of 1995 wherein it is stated that a certain Mr Vuyani </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>Mngaza was going to testify before the Commission </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>between the ninth and 12 of June 1997 and was going </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>to implicate me.  I do remember Mr Mngaza as the </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>only garage owner in Duncan Village during the </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>1960's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a> In 1965 when a man, who was the messenger for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>PAC high command in exile (Lesotho) and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>remaining pockets of PAC members in South Africa </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>was arrested, it became clear that Mr Mngaza played a </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>leading role in the activities of the PAC in East </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>London and, in fact, he was responsible for sending a </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>woman to Lesotho to assist the PAC.  This woman </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>and Mr Mngaza were involved in the intended attack </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>and killing of Whites throughout South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a> I am not sure whether I or others under me actually </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>arrested Mr Mngaza, but he was taken into custody </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>and later charged.  At no time was Mr Mngaza </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>assaulted by me or anyone else in my presence while </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>he was in custody, but on what occasion I did hear that </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>Mr Mngaza had acted strangely and was taken to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>doctor for mental observation.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a> Mr Mngaza was later charged and appeared before the </p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>Supreme Court in Grahamstown before Judge </p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>Kannemeyer.  Due to the fact that the court felt that </p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>there was insufficient evidence to corroborate the main </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>State witness, Mr Mngaza was acquitted.  At the trial </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>Mr Mngaza swore under oath that he was not a </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>member of the PAC and I know notice in Annexure </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>EC68/96 that he was a founder member of the Border </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>region of the PAC.  That, of course, says very little for </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>his integrity, but I suppose he will say that he told lies </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>to stay out of prison.  So, is he lying now for the sake </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>of money.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a> With regard to the allegations on Annexure 68/96, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>will deal with them as follows.  Number one, I did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>know that there was a Border branch of the PAC in </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>1950.  I believed that it was established after 1957.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>Number two, I had no dealings with the arrest of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>Mngaza in 1963.  In fact, I did not know that he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>been arrested.  Number three, I have no knowledge of </p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>Mr Mngaza's detention and release on the 11th of </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>October 1963.  Four, in 1963 I was not a member of </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>the Security Police nor did I have dealings with Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>Mngaza then.  Five, ...".  </p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>I am on point number five of Mr Donald John Card's statement about Mr Vuyani </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>Mngaza.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a> "In 1963 I did work with Detective- Sergeant </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>Scheepers, Detective-Constable Chikila, Constable </p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>Babba Gooysen and Detective-Constable Hans </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>Mynhardt, but we had nothing to do with Mr Mngaza. </p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a> Sixth, I do remember that Mr Mngaza was sent for </p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>mental observation, but I cannot remember for how </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>long.  I do remember that he was declared fit for trial </p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>so do not know whether he was pretending or not.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>Seven, I have no knowledge of a civil claim.  Eight, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>Attorney-General has nothing to do with civil claims </p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>and neither did the Security Police.  These claims are </p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>dealt with between the claimants advocate, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>registrar and the court.  So I find Mr Mngaza's </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>statement very difficult to understand.  Nine, I have no </p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>knowledge of an application for a passport by Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>Mngaza.  Ten, to the best of my knowledge, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>Mngaza had left this country by 1967 and I do not </p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>know about these charges.  11, If my memory serves </p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>me correctly, our money system in 1967 was in rands </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>and not in pounds.  I also do not know of a further </p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>charge of sabotage in 1967 against Mr Mngaza.  12, </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>Mr Mngaza was arrested in 1964 or 65 on a minor </p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>charge and was released on R500,00 bail, but when he </p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>was re-arrested on a more serious charge, bail was </p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>opposed and he was kept in custody in East London </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>and transferred to Grahamstown for trial before the </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>Supreme Court.  13, The trial before Judge </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>Kannemeyer was in 1965 and not in 1967.  14, I do </p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>not know the cost of legal fees, but do know that </p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>individuals seldom pay for legal fees when a political </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>organisation is involved.  It is again strange that rands </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>and not pounds are now quoted.  15, The sale of Pan </p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>African Motors took place sometime after Mr Mngaza </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>was acquitted and it must have cost a considerable </p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>amount of money to go to Dakar with his whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>family.  16, I did see letters written by Mr Mngaza </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>from Senegal.  17, I know that the whole family left </p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>with him.  18, I did not know that Mr Mngaza had </p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>returned to South Africa.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a> I would like to point out that the information supplied </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>on the Annexure appears to be that of a confused </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>person and honestly does not make sense to me and </p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>therefore it is very difficult to answer except to say that </p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>Mr Mngaza was not assaulted by me or anyone else in </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>my presence nor was he badly treated.  He did have to </p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>wait some time for his trial, but that was a matter for </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>the courts and not the police.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a> Furthermore, I gain the impression that what Mngaza </p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>is seeking is the R2 650,00 which he says he paid for </p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>legal costs.  This appears to be a small amount of </p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>money for an attorney and an advocate's attendance at </p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>a Supreme Court hearing in Grahamstown.  Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>Mngaza's stated under oath that he was not a PAC </p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>member, but it is now obvious that he is once again </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>lying in order to substantiate his claims for costs.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>Signed Donald John Card.".</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>Thank you Mr Chairperson.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Again, it is very sad that Mr Card is not here personally so that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>can ask him questions according to his statement.  It is also sad that he is, he made a </p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>judgement about the confusion of Mr Mngaza.  In our eyes we see him as a perfectly </p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>normal person, not a confused person, but we will try and get in touch with Mr Card.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>Maybe in Section 29 hearing so that we can get clarity in what is written in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>statement.  He imputed bad motives to Mr Mngaza.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a> We think that we have to close.  The report we got concerning electricity is </p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>that this effected the whole Highway area.  It will, this will continue and they hope that </p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>if the weather is clear tomorrow our proceedings are going to be normal.  If it is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>they are going to request a generator to help us.  Tomorrow we have a women hearing </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>looking at issues which involved women in detention.  We have 14 people, were </p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>supposed to give their evidence today.  We thought that tomorrow the women hearing </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>will proceed as planned from half past nine.  If we manage to finish in time we will </p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>continue with this hearing tomorrow, but if we have to go through to Friday we will </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>do that and have our hearing up until 12 on Friday.  All the people who are, who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>supposed to testify today, we will meet with them tomorrow, but if we did not finish </p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>we will meet them on Friday.  We have to listen to everybody, because this is our last </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>hearing.  We would like people to be patient with us.  If we knew that there is this </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>situation here in Mdantsane we would have brought our own electricity from Cape </p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>Town.  It is said that you do not pay electricity here in Mdantsane.  Thank you and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>will come tomorrow at half past nine.  </p>
