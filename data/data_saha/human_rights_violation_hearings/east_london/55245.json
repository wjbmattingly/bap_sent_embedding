Before this man could come there was one man who came saying that there are people distributing pamphlets around.  He said that these people are dangerous people and he said that if I saw a person who was distributing pamphlets of a guerrilla warfare I must be careful, because they are dangerous.  That is what this man said.  I asked him whether I can quote his name, because he is the one who gave me this information.  He said, no, I must not quote his name, because if I did they will assassinate me, they will point me and kill me.  He then left me.\n The following day after he gave me this message this person came, the one who was distributing pamphlets.  He said to me as I was a person who use to read different books, he said to me I have these books for you to read.  I took one of them and it was written Guerrilla Warfare.  He said that as I was a wise man I am supposed to read this, because people from Westbank are wise people.  So they said that they would like me to join them.",
