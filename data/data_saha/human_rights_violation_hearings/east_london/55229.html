<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Where your home was attacked and one person died inside the house and certain police were injured.  Are you going to talk about that story?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Please tell us briefly what happened on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> On the 16th of July 1987 Matemba and I got up in the morning, Matemba Vuso.  I was preparing to come to Highway to have my shoes repaired at the shoemaker.  I left him behind cleaning.  I went to Highway and I did all that I was supposed to do.  On my return, as I was using the main road up to Mount Ruth I got to the T-junction joining the way from Cecilia Makiwane Hospital I heard a noise.  When I looked towards the right I found that the children from Hosanah College toyi-toying.  There was someone standing next to me I asked him what was going on and he pointed in front of me and said I must look.  As I looked there was a Hippo a Casspir turning towards the main street going to Mount Ruth.  At the time there was a group of soldiers walking down from people's houses.  As I was trying to figure what was going on this Casspir went from house to house.  I thought that they'd got lost.  It went into the fourth house.  I walked into a house opposite this Casspir and a White policeman came towards me pointing a gun at me saying that I must get out of the way.  I tried to go back home but as I turned right going home I turned left again going straight home.  As I got into the street I saw  that there were a whole lot of white cars Ford  Sierra's and Ford Escourts.  I walked right past and I had a bag with me.  I looked at my house and I realised that my fencing had fallen apart.  Outside my house there were blankets and bedspreads.  I walked past my house.  I walked past my house.  Steven Knipe......  I left my bag there with Tammy and I told him that I would come back.  There were a whole lot of things going on.   Even though I was there by mistake I told myself that I was going to go to the Border Council of Churches.  As I was going up the road a child called out to me.  This child told me about his brother who was in exile.  They were fighting over the phone.  The one wanted to phone the sister and tell her what was happening.  They said that I must go and help with the dispute.  I did not realise at the time that this house was the house where the Hippo had gone in and when I went there it caused my arrest.  As I went down the road a Ford Escourt came driving very fast and when it came close to me about six metres it braked but drove past.  I thought I better not run away else they would shoot at me.  This car reversed and stopped right in front of me and a man got out of the driver's seat.  It was Mhleli whom I knew.  He would come to my aunt at Mgwane on holiday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Who is Mhleli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> He is Mfunani.  Mhleli said that I'd grown up at his home even though he was the one who was going to my aunt.  Mhleli was my cousin's half brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Was Mhleli a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> He was a Security Branch officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Could we revert back please, please tell us what exactly happened on this day you said that you saw your fence was down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> The security officers and soldiers were at my house looking for an MK member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Was there an MK member in your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Yes, Rousseau was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Is his is Matemba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> What did you eventually find out happened at your place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Matemba passed away.  I was taken back to my house.  Van Wyk was there with Captain Mfundisi.  Captain van Wyk had my marriage certificate and pictures and asked if that was my documentation and I said yes.  He showed me two policemen that had passed away.  He then took me to a corner where Matemba was lying, dead.  I did not see anyone though.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Did you eventually find out how he died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> I got his story when a State Witness Mr Mxhata gave evidence.  He gave evidence about me in court.  He said that he was on the lookout and kept on hiding behind a wall but got shot.  He said he'd been shot by a particular policeman</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Have you given us this name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> I do not remember it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> After you were shot at home, what happened to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Van Wyk said that Mfundisi must take me to the police station and they must make sure that I divulge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> And when you got to this police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> They took me towards the Security section and I went in.  There was a passage and some rooms with doors closed.  I was not given a good reception as I was beaten up with all the weapons they had in their hands.  They told me to go in but I didn't know what they were talking about because the doors were closed.  Eventually a door was opened and I went into this room where there was an elderly man who strangled me saying that the police are dead and they tried to stop him.  He told me to tell them my story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Mr Bikitsha the people who were assaulting you, did you know any of them or can you identify any of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> I saw many of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Did you give us details about them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> I have a list of their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Can you please give us the names of those you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Mxhata, Delait Mazewa, Swelindaho, Mfundisi and Bouti.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mr Bikitsha, are there any people on that list that are still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Bouti and Mtatha are in higher ranks now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Thank you, for how long were you detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> For ninety six days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> How were you treated during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> ................ the treatment I got after the interrogations we wrote autobiographies and they left us alone.  We appeared before the Magistrate Mxhaeba</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a> and we saw the doctor Agweno we made a claim and we were told that he is the Ciskei but he's still in Cecilia Makiwane even to-day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Is there anything else you would like to add before I as you for your requests or your expectations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Yes, there is something I would like to add.  The Government robbed us because we won our claim an out of court settlement.  Firstly, we were robbed because we were sent to the Magistrate and instead of coming and checking our situation he talked to us as if he was talking to children.  Secondly, the doctor was said to be missing and our folders were missing but the doctor was there.  They made this up so that we would not be able to claim.  My house was damaged as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Please give us the name of the Magistrate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> He is Mxhaeba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> And the doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Agweno.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Thank you.  What are your requests or what do you expect the Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> First of all I would like these people to come forward with their side of the story so that we can hear their side of the story.  Secondly, as the situation was like it was there were no doctors that were helping us we were not treated properly and we were tortured .  The single cells in which we were kept had no windows.  We were then transferred to solitary confinement in prison and we needed medical treatment because we suffered from stress and from torture.  Thirdly, my house and my properties ...  I got three thousand rand and I could not even buy enough clothes to wear with that kind of money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mr Bikitsha I will now hand over to the Chairperson and maybe you will be asked questions.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Mr Sandi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Bikitsha you mentioned certain names in your statement and when you were talking you didn't mention these names, who was Mr Nonhonho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> He was a Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did he take part in this process?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Yes, he did because I was tortured by Mnandana their sub-ordinate.  They pretended to be better and I went to Nonhonho.  They also had documents of people who were in exile.  They interrogated us about these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What did Mr Nonhonho do to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> He was instructing these people to do the things they were doing to me.  They were in his command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> When you're talking about these people are you talking about Mtatha, the late Mazilwa, Swelendao, Mfundisi  and Bouti?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Yes, and others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Mr Bikitsha I have only one question for you, you are talking about doctors.  You were tortured and then you were taken to the doctors for treatment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Please repeat Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Do you have a medical report to substantiate the allegation of torture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> No, we were never given a medical report.  We went to Abes a coloured guy when we were released but I don't know if he's still around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> The second question, I want to know what kind of torture was used on you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Firstly, they used a cube.  They tortured us daily for the two weeks that we spent there.  They also used a ............ they would handcuff our arms and our legs and they would put something between your knees and your hands and then they'd put two tables together and put you between those tables with your head upside down.  This affected my arms and my legs.   If you were tall enough so that your had touched the floor they would lift the two tables so that you can hang.  At the time you would have nothing on top and they would push you and beat you with a sjambok all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> What did you refer the one you just mentioned to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> It was boeing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Who were torturing you, do you know their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> There were many of them but Bouti and  Mtatha were also there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> There are a number of perpetrators you've mentioned.  All of them will come forward to deny that they were involved so your evidence must clearly clarify who did this to you or were your eyes closed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> At the time I didn't know them but as I was in prison I got to know them.  They were doing one thing at the same time they were not sending each other.  All of them were eager.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Lastly Mr Bikitsha, you mentioned Boyce ..........., Nokalema Thomas as the witnesses.  Are these your witnesses, were they detained with you or what are they witnessing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> Boyce .................. is not a witness we were charged together.  Nokalema was the one who hired a lawyer Magqabi for me.   He applied for a grant to pay for my house from the Border Council of Churches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you for saying that you received a grant from the Border Council of Churches because I'm from there.  Were you tortured alone was there no one who can witness this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> I was alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Were you in solitary confinement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> In the torture room you would be alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> I think this is my last question, you said that at home there was a person who was a member of Umkhonto weSizwe, were you a member of Umkhonto weSizwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> I received training inside.  I received my training inside the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> My question was were you a member of Umkhonto weSizwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIKITSHA:</span> No, I was not a member of Umkhonto weSizwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you very much Mr Bikitsha, we apologise for asking you many questions but we have to get clarity because you've mentioned a lot of people's names and these people would like to appear before the Commission to deny these allegations.  We have to get clarity so that we are able to know what the real truth is.  I would like to thank you for now, you may go back to your seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> We will call three people who want to state their side of the story regarding Zwelakhe Bikitsha's evidence.  The first one is Mr Mhleli Mfunani who will be with his legal representative Mr Mbandazayo.  Mr Mbandazayo please confirm your name and the name of your client and the reason why you want to appear before the Commission to-day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman I confirm that I am Lungelo Mbandazayo .............. and I'm representing Mr Mhleli Mfunani ...............</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you.  Mr Mhleli Mfunani  we would like you to take an oath.  We thank you for coming here to give us your side of the story with regard to Mr Bikitsha's evidence.  Reverend Xundu will help you take the oath, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLELI MFUNANI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Mr Mbandazayo please proceed with your client.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman as usual you have before you main points which my client will give evidence on and I will start asking him to give evidence on those points.  Mr Mfunani you have heard the complainant Mr Bikitsha giving evidence regarding the circumstances of the day in question, can you before the Commission and in your own words tell the Commission what happened on the day in question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> I can do that Sir.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.   First of all it is true that the witness who was here, we used to live together a lot of times.  Secondly Mr Chairperson on this particular day I was working in Bisho and I had just been promoted after writing police examinations.  I was at the Head Office in Bisho at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a> On this particular day I was with late Captain Maganuga coming to Mdantsane to the Security Offices there and we had no idea of any operation.  We got to Mdantsane and there was a joint operation.  We went with the late Captain Maganuga to the office and asked what was going on.  We heard that we were going to NU 3 to 7809.   At the time I was not aware whose house this was but out of curiosity we followed the police.  When we were near Kyalatemba we heard gunshots from NU 74.  We were standing near Kyalatemba.  After the gunshots stopped we went nearer.  If I remember clearly when I arrived there, there were police and soldiers.  I don't remember the police who asked me but I was asked to take the injured police to Cecilia Makiwane which I did.  I came back from Cecilia Makiwane hospital because I wanted to know what happened.  I was shown the police who died and one guy from exile.  I don't remember who said this but I received a message that I was called over the police radio.  I don't remember if it was the Commander of Mdantsane but he said that the owner of this house was Mr Zwelakhe Bikitsha and as I was the person who knew him I had to help them arrest him which I did as a policeman.  I arrested Mr Bikitsha together with other police but I don't remember who they were.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a> After that I left him in Mdantsane Security Branch and I never met with him again.  Fortunately Mr Chairperson he didn't even mention that I was the one torturing him.  I met him again in court.  That is all Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you Mr Mfunani, if you have no objections we are going to ask you a few questions.  Mr Mfunani I think that your statement is very clear but I just want to know when you got to Mdantsane Security Branch offices to whom did you hand Mr Bikitsha over to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> To the Captain who was Mr Mhlangabise at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Is Mhlangabise the first name or surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> It Mhlangabise Mfundisi, the surname is Mfundisi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> You then met him again in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> Yes, that is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Who handed him over to you when you met in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> I met him in court on the day when he was charged.  He appeared in court because he was charged but I don't remember whether it was on this day that I testified but I did testify because I submitted a statement as I was the one who arrested him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.   Mr Mfunani, we have a problem with time so I would like you to be very brief in your answers if you can, you can just say yes or no.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Let me start by asking this, what is your rank in the police force now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> I left the police force as a Major in 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> When did you joint the police force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> In 1979.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> In your career as a policeman in Ciskei you've come across various incidents like bus boycotts and others, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> At the time of the bus boycott were you a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Here in Mdantsane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Lets proceed without wasting any time.  Do you know Mr Bikitsha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> How do you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> We were staying in the same house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Why then is he accusing you of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> I think that he's accusing me because I was the one who arrested him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you speak to each other after the incident of this arrest, did you meet with each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> I met him in court Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you not meet after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is it the first time that you see him to-day after appearing in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> I used to see him in the street when I was driving my car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You never spoke to each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Why then is he accusing you of this, were you in conflict before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MFUNANI:</span> Mr Chairperson I said that he may be accusing me because I was the one who arrested him.   If you listened very carefully when he was testifying he never mentioned my name as one of the people who were torturing him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Mfunani, I'm very sorry that we do not have enough time.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you Mr Mfunani, we are not making any findings concerning this matter.  When we take a decision to include your name as a perpetrator in this case we will inform you so that we can get more representation from your side if you so wish but for now we thank you and we thank Mr Mbandazayo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Are you not appearing for Mr Mfundisi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> I think Mr Nompozolo  is appearing for Captain Mfundisi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Nompozolo is his surname he is appearing Superintendent Mfundisi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> I'm very sorry, you are excused.   Let us ask Mr Umhlangabise Mfundisi to come forward.  I'm sorry we got wrong information, could you introduce yourself and introduce your client?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, Mr Chairman my name is Lindile Nompozolo from Nompozolo ............. Attorneys in East London.</p>

<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Nompozolo.</p>

<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you very much Sir.  Thank you for appearing before the Commission Mr Mfundisi, please stand to take the oath.  Reverend Xundu will lead you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMHLANGABISE MMFUNDISI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Mr Mfundisi we have your statement and we'll hand over to you Mr Nompozolo to lead the witness in evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  What is your rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> It's Superintendent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Presently?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> And on the sixteen of July 1987, what was your rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> A Captain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Who was your employer at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> The Ciskeian Police, the Government of the Ciskei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> On the day in question we have already heard that there was a raid or a mission, can you confirm your role there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> There was indeed a raid and my role was to be the Commander of the entire raid.  I had to answer to all questions and see to it that the raid went smoothly.  I was a specialist in weapons therefore I had to inspect the whole ............</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> The testimony of Mr Zwelakhe Bikitsha says that you instructed Mxhata to take him to the police station and to make him talk, what is your answer to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> It is true, I gave Mxhata orders to take him to the police station whoever I did not say that he must make him talk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> The evidence of Bikitsha alleges that you and other policemen tortured him although he was not specific.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> I have never tortured him in any way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Are there questions?   Do you have any objection to us asking the witness some questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> No objections Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you.  Reverend Xundu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> I just want to ask one question, according to your knowledge with a long record of being a policeman do you think anybody was tortured by the police or people's rights were violated by the police or have you never heard of such?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> It would happen.  Some people would be charged and sentenced and some people would even be killed.  There are those who do not appear before the court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Would it happen that if you wanted information from someone that person would be tortured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> Yes, it would happen but not daily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Mr Sandi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  I did not understand your answer to Reverend Xundu clearly as people started laughing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> It would happen that people were beaten but not daily.  What I'm saying is it would depend on the people that are beating the person up and why.  I cannot be specific and say so and so was beaten or why that person was beaten.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Perhaps Mr Chairperson you would allow me to make this statement before I ask questions.  The alleged perpetrators remind me of a book I once read in which it said there are three types of lazy people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> It is not me I do not know anything about it and I do not care.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Let us go back to the methods used when people are being interrogated, what methods would be used to interrogate people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> Let me rectify this I did not say that it is when people are arrested it only happens sometimes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Let's talk about people who are arrested somebody who is being interrogated maybe the police wanted information from that person, how would you ascertain that you get co-operation from the prisoner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> According to the law one would interrogate the person by questioning beyond that would not be according to the law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> As a policeman can you tell me what methods would you use to interrogate people that are arrested?  If you wanted information from a prisoner what method would you use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> I personally would be very careful especially if the case was mine because I would want the case to be successful.  I would not interrogate a person without information I would rather leave that person. I would succeed because as I interrogate this person it would come across that I know more than the prisoner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Mr Mfundisi  the questions that we would ask as the Commission are not because we do not know the answers to the questions.  Each witness appearing before us would swear and be on oath to tell the truth even though we have the answers but because we want to ascertain the truthfulness of the person we ask questions to.  Who gave orders on this day when you were commanding the raid as I need clarity here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> What orders or instructions about the raid or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> As a Commander of this particular unit where did you receive your instructions from, what were you supposed to do and where?  Please be patient Sir and wait for me to say I'm finished, I'm through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> A week before the raid White men from the Security Branch in East London came telling me that there is an anonymous letter which they received and this letter contained information about the Security Police.  The letter alleged that we wanted Matembo Umwuso who stayed in the house of a certain Mr Bikitsha.  This person proceeded saying that we must raid this house as there are arms and explosives which are unlawful and this person was at home most of the time especially during the day however at night this person goes out.  This person said he wanted to get rid of the person with the illegal arms.  I asked for this letter but it was not given to me and I was then requested by the Security Branch Officers from East London to help them find this man.  I was a bit concerned because this was not the usual way of getting information.  It probably was someone who was close to this family or who knew them very well but the question was, who was this person.  I took the telephone directory there was only one Bikitsha that was listed next to Mount Ruth.  I was a bit confused because a second Bikitsha came up within the area.  somebody phone saying that this anonymous person phoned again and this person was urging us to make this raid.  This time I got the chance to read the letter.  We did not know whether this was a trap and we did not know who Bikitsha was.  We summoned a task force and handed this over to them.  After the task force had searched the house we would be allowed to search the house.  It was .......................... who would lead this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Excuse me Mr Mfundisi you have answered me I just wanted to know where you got the orders from.  Apparently you got this from the Republic of South Africa even though you were the police of the Republic of Ciskei.  Let us conclude  this matter.  You said you are an expert where explosives are concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Could you clarify that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Order please we are not in a circus we are in a hearing, order please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> I'm not sure what you're saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> When did you become an expert in explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> In 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you study?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman I won't take this any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you  Mr ......................  Mr Mfundisi you were listening when ...   Do you confirm that you arrested Mr Bikitsha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Did you confirm that Mr Bikitsha was handed over to you after having been arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Was this at Mdantsane Security Offices?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> I think there is a mistake.  When he was arrested I was still at Mr Bikitsha's house conducting the search.  What caused the delay was as a person in charge after the whole raid I would have to give a detailed report to the Head Office and wait for the photographers therefore I was still there.  He then he came saying that he has this Mr Bikitsha and that is how he was handed over to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Therefore you are disputing the fact that he was taken to Mdantsane Security Police and handed over to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> I think there's a mistake there it didn't happen that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Why are you sentencing him, aren't you making a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> No, I wouldn't, I couldn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Who had a higher rank you or Mfunani, who was superior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> It was myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Who was in charge of detainees?  Clarify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> Lets start here.  If somebody is arrested because he is a threat to the Security according to Section 26 of the Ciskei it is the panel therefore?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Sir we are not talking under general here please, lets not waste time.  We are not under general here we are talking about a specific person that is Mr Bikitsha.  Who was in charge of the detention of Bikitsha for purposes of interrogation.  The evidence which has been placed before us is that he was handed over to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> The person that was in charge was the person heading the Security the person who was responsible at the time was Colonel Nonhonho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Why did it take us so long to tell us it was Colonel Nonhonho?  Therefore it was not you it was Colonel Nonhonho and so if we want to know the truth about this whether Mr Bikitsha was violated we should as Colonel Nonhonho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> If Bikitsha's rights were violated you would get an immediate report from Colonel Nonhonho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Who was more senior between the two of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> It was Colonel Nonhonho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMFUNDISI:</span> Perhaps I can elaborate I've a copy of Bikitsha's detention he was detained by Sergeant Zinzile on instructions of Colonel Nonhonho.  This is the extract of the OB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Mr Mfundisi, we are going to request that we go into greater detail with you later.  We do not make a finding yet as we need a lot of clarity on this matter we will send you a notice of Section 29 and request that you appear before us to give us more detail and clarity.  For now we give you a break until we meet under Section 29, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Are you appearing for Mr Mtatha as well?  Mr Mtatha please?  Mr Nompozolo could you please identify yourself again and tell us who your client is.</p>

<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Do you know who arrested him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Major Mfunani arrested him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> After the arrest what happened to Bikitsha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> He was arrested by Major Mfunani and I escorted him to the police station where I handed him over to the other police but I was standing outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> In you Affidavit you have attached an extract from the Occurrence Book, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Can you read to the Commission what was written at 16:05.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Detention.  Sergeant Zinzile details blackmail Zwelakhe Bikitsha under Section 26.  Instruction from Colonel Nonhonho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you.  You heard the allegations from Mr Bikitsha that you were one of his assailants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Yes, I did hear those allegations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Those allegations are not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> After he was detained did you ever have contact with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> I gave him clothes to change that's when I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Where you his investigating officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> No, I was never his investigating officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  There's just one point I left out Mr Chairman.  He indicated to the Commission that you were given instructions by the then Captain Mfundisi to take him to the police station and to make him talk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> No, he's making a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you very much Mr Mtatha, in your last answer you said that he was making a mistake.  He made a mistake in that you were instructed by Captain Mfundisi but he was assaulted by Mr Nonhonho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> He's making a mistake by saying that I was given instructions by Captain Mfundisi to torture him so that he can talk because Captain Mfundisi on that day couldn't give us instructions because there was a Senior, Lieutenant Mfunani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Mr Nompozolo do you want to consult with your client?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Just switch of the mike whilst you are consulting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  The witness wants to rephrase his answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Go ahead Mr Mtatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> I never got such instructions.  The instruction I got was to escourt a car to the police station not to torture him so that he can give us some information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you, are there questions?  Reverend Xundu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Mr Chairperson when a person had been arrested the police would say that we would make you talk, didn't you hear the use of such terminology in connection with people who were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> I did hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What did that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Sometime a person would be asked questions concerning a charge laid against him or ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You said sometimes, what would happen at other times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Or he would be instructed to write down what he was saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> He would not be tortured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> He would not be assaulted he would just be told and given tea and be told to write down because we wanted the truth from him</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Secondly, you said you were present in the raid on the house, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You were armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did you shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> No, I did not shoot Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> But your colleagues did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> I don't remember during that operation except for those who were inside the yard I think those were the ones who shot but of those that were with me nobody shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> There was no order that you must shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> No, there was no order as Colonel who was superior in that operation there was no order saying that we must shoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> So those that did use their weapons shot out of their own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Yes, because they saw the situation fit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> They took the law into their own hands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Tiny Maya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Mtatha I have two questions for you.  First of all the copy of the occurrence book attached to your Affidavit, what is the purpose thereof is it because you know the person who wrote this occurrence or do you want to clarify to us who arrested this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> I wanted to clarify who arrested him and who took him to prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> According to this extract it is said that Mr Bikitsha was arrested under the orders of Colonel Nonhonho, do you have any knowledge concerning that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> According to this Section, Section 26 when you read it is said that the person who has a right to arrest a person is a Colonel and his Superiors.  The sub-ordinates do not have a right to arrest a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> You gave us this statement saying that instructions were from Colonel Nonhonho, do you have any knowledge of that?  Let me leave that question and say that you heard Inspector Mfundisi saying that the person was responsible for the detainees was Colonel Nonhonho, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> In other words if a person arrested for interrogation Colonel Nonhonho would have a knowledge of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> I may be wrong when I refer to the Affidavit of Colonel Nonhonho because he is not here, but I'm going to ask this question as you gave me the right to ask because of the extract. (Extract from Colonel Nonhonho's statement: Some weeks later whilst on leave I was informed that Zwelakhe, Mr Bikitsha had been arrested).  He said that he knew about that Mr Bikitsha had been arrested some weeks later but your extract said that Mr Bikitsha was arrested under Section 26 under instructions from Colonel Nonhonho, can you please explain this to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> He wants to consult with Mr Chairman.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MAYA:</span> Mr Nompozolo if you don't mind I would like to withdraw the question thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Unless you insist on answering the question because the statement being referred to is the statement of Colonel Nonhonho he's the one who made the statement but what we want to know from Mr Mtatha perhaps now, is he confirming that Mr Nonhonho was present and is he confirming that Mr Nonhonho did instruct the detention of ... and you must remember that he is under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> According to the OB extract Mr Chairperson I do confirm because it is written this way according to the OB extract.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> The question asked was do you confirm that Mr Nonhonho gave you the instructions and did he give you these instructions while he was on holiday or was he present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Mr Chairperson according to the OB extract as this was written by one member of the Security Branch it is very difficult for me to know whether this member who signed this OB extract ... because we'd be given instructions and told to do a job at that particular time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> You saw the police who were in that operation, was Mr Nonhonho there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Because I was busy on that day and I was shocked because there were bullets all over I'm not sure whether he was there or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Mr Mtatha we thank you for now, as I've already said to Mr Mfundisi who testified before you we are going to give you notices with a view to an in-depth investigation on this matter.  We are not contemplating making a finding at this stage which would want to declare you a perpetrator we would want to hold a more in-depth hearing after we will have more time to go in-depth on this matter.  What you have said now remains on our records and we will be using that in a Section 29 hearing.  Thank you Mr Nompozolo for your assistance you may be excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTATHA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Lastly we want to read Mr Nonhonho's statement for the record.  He's not here but his attorney Mr Clarke sent us his statement for the record so that when we look deeper into the matter we have his statement on record.  Mrs Crichton will read this statement for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MISS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>STATEMENT</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>I,</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>LOUIS L NONHONHO,</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>hereby state as follows:</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>I was previously employed as a Major General in the former Ciskei Police.  Prior to my appointment as Major General, in fact, shortly after I was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, I was placed as head of the Security Branch.        </p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>Shortly before the arrest of Zwelakhe Bikitsha, a typed letter was received by the Security Police in Cambridge, informing them that there were people with firearms and explosives at Zwelakhe's house.  This information was sent to my head office in Bisho and I was sent to investigate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>When I arrived on the scene I saw that two members of the Police had been murdered and another person with an AK47 in his hand was found dead on the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>Some weeks later, whilst I was on leave, I was informed that Zwelakhe had been arrested.  I had nothing to do with his arrest and I deny the allegations contained n his charge against me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>I cannot understand why this matter is being brought to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  This matter was previously finalised in the Bisho High Court.  The matter was finalised under Case Number 19/88, when Zwelakhe received an undisclosed sum from the Ciskei Government in full and final settlement of his claim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>therefore, submit that there is absolutely no reason for this matter to be brought before this Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>DATED at EAST  LONDON this 4 day of JUNE 1997.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>_________________________</p>

<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a> </p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MISS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you.  We regret that Mr Nonhonho decided not to avail himself to us to answer a very pertinent question arising out of his statement.  One of which is the one that has been alluded to by Miss Maya but we are hoping that we will be able to meet with him under Section 29 of the Act and converse with him further on what he has said in his statement.  Thank you very much we'll adjourn and meet to-morrow at half past nine.</p>
