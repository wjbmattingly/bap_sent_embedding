<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  We will ask Mrs Msawuli to come forward.  Pardon.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>MS MAYA:  He is a man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mnyute okay.  Mr Mnyute please come forward.  Thank you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>Welcome Mr Mnyute and Mrs Msawuli.  I will start with you Mrs Msawuli to help </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>you take an oath.  Please stand up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>MRS MSAWULI:  (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mrs Msawuli.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>MR MNYUTE:  (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Sir.  I will now hand over to Mr Sandi to lead you with </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>questions on behalf of the Commission.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>ADV SANDI:  Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Let us start with Mrs Msawuli.  Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>Msawuli, you are here to talk about Mr Msawuli who was shot in 1990.  Is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>MRS MSAWULI:  Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>ADV SANDI:  Was Mr Msawuli your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>MRS MSAWULI:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>ADV SANDI:  What are his full names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>MRS MSAWULI:  Mtyanti Vusumzi Artwell Msawuli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>ADV SANDI:  Let me now hand over to you to tell us what happened on this </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>particular day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>MRS MSAWULI:  I was at work.  I was on night duty.  There was, our niece was </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>there, Sheila, my daughter and Mr Galelekile was also there.  On the 29th of March </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>1990, it was on a Thursday.  President Mandela was going to be in Bisho on the 31st </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>in the stadium.  I was on a night shit in Mount Cook Hospital.  My husband was </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>working for the Hector Foundation.  I heard a one year, three months baby.  During </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>the day I looked after the baby.  At night my husband was looking after the baby.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>would give him a report about what had happened during the day.  I went to work, my </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>husband was not at home.  I was worried, because my child was not well at that time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a> At about one in the morning I received a telephone call from the matron.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>requested me to go to the office together with one person I was working with.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>asked the security man to accompany us to the office.  When we got to the office they </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>said that Sheila was alone at home.  The baby was sick, your husband was not at </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>home.  He attended a meeting.  Pindile and Andile are here to take you home.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>asked me whether I knew Pindile.  I said, yes, Pindile was my neighbour.  They asked </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>whether I knew Andile.  I thought that Andile was their niece.  I said, yes, I do know </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>Andile.  We were taken to the car.  I asked them why are you here.  They said that </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>they told my matron.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a> At home the lights were on.  I went through the kitchen door.  I saw this child </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>staying in bed.  I asked where is my baby.  My baby was lying down and we heard </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>that, they told me that my husband was shot and he died.  People said that my husband </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>came back home at about nine.  His friend brought him home, Monde Mkhunqwana.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>They were studying together social sciences.  They use to go and study in Sandiswe </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>School.  He left my husband at home.  My husband took off his jacket and his shoes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>He was watching television.  He heard a knock at the door.  It was Andile together </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>with another young man.  I found out later on that that young man was the cadre.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a> At about 20 past nine there was another knock at the door.  My husband went </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>to the kitchen.  Our kitchen door had two doors.  He asked who are you?  This person </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>said that I am Monks.  This Monks is Monde Mkhunqwana.  He then opened the </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>door.  There was a quarrel at the door.  My husband saying that why are you selling </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>me out?  He then said that, Comrades, let us not fight, let us talk.  There was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>gunshot.  The second one struck him and he fell down.  Andile went to the bedroom.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>He took out a knife from his pocket, because he thought these were the police.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>tried to hide under the bed.  The other young man just stood in the dining-room.  My </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>one child was 13 years old at the time. </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a> My child saw a man wearing a balaclava and a black jacket.  This man was </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>shooting my husband while he was lying down.  After that he left and the other one </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>took a mat outside and they covered him with this mat.  This young man told my child </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>to go and close the door.  My child then closed and locked the door.  He phoned their </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>grandfather, Duno Bamsouli.  At that time he was in Pretoria.  He then phoned the </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>neighbours.  This young man was still there.  They did not see him leaving, leaving the </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>house.  After that the police came and they took him.  They cleaned blood spots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a> When I arrived at home there was no blood.  Everything was clean.  There </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>were no photographers.  The following morning Monde Mkhunqwana came.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>were in the bedroom at that time.  He said that I was together with Saule the whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>day and the person who knocked at the door identified himself as myself.  I dropped </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>him at about nine.  When I was going back home at NU16 I heard gunshots and </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>Monde Mkhunqwana was the one saying this.  The police came in the morning saying </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>that we must go to the police station.  I made a statement.  I thought that the people </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>who killed my husband were the police.  I said to them I suspect Sitilie Golo, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>he was the one harassing us at home.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>ADV SANDI:  Mrs Msawuli, was there anyone arrested by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>MRS MSAWULI:  Nobody was arrested.  I went to the police now and again asking </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>whether there was anybody arrested.  They said no, but they said that they will try and </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>find this person.  Again in 1994 I wrote a letter to the Minister of Justice telling him </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>about this incident.  He asked me where this happened and I told him.  I did not get a </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>reply after that.  Again last year in April I went to the Truth Commission to give out </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>my statement.  I said that because he was working for the ANC the ANC people will </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>help me to find the perpetrator.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a> Again I visited the investigators of the Truth Commission saying that I had </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>information. My daughter-in-law had information.  Patricia Msawuli said that Andile is </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>willing to come forward to tell people in public who did this.  There were four people </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>and he named, mentioned them by their names.  Again I said that there were rumours </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>about a certain person who shot at home.  He was a cadre and I told them to try and </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>investigate this person so that we can find out the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>ADV SANDI:  Mrs Msawuli, how old is Sheila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>MRS MSAWULI:  Sheila was born in 1975.  She was 13 years old at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>ADV SANDI:  She was the one present during this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>MRS MSAWULI:  Yes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>ADV SANDI:  In your statement you stated that you would like this issue to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>investigated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>MRS MSAWULI:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>ADV SANDI:  Do you have any other requests except this one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>MRS MSAWULI:  My request is that my husband was the breadwinner.  He was also </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>supporting the community at large.  He would take children to school and he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>involved in community sport.  I have two young children and I am raising them alone.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>It is very difficult to be a single parent.  I would like the four men who did this to come </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>forward and I would like the Truth Commission to help me regarding this matter so </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>that these people can come forward and tell us the truth, why they killed my husband.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>Maybe I will forgive them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>ADV SANDI:  Thank you Mrs Msawuli.  Maybe you will be asked questions.  I will </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>hand over to the Chairperson.  Thank you.  Mr Mnyute, you also have a complaint in </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>connection to a 1990 incident.  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>MR MNYUTE:  Yes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>ADV SANDI:  You say that there were pamphlets about you.  What were they stating </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>and what was the source?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>MR MNYUTE:  They gave me a new name that I am an informer.  These pamphlets </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>were distributed, because we were oppressed by the White man and our own people </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>from the homelands.  I was one of the people who made a way that, of people to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>outspoken especially for the youth together with my colleague who is late.  We started </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>the East London Youth Congress.  We had not gone far, but because they realised that </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>I was not well educated we were being undermined, demeaned.  The youth opened </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>another organisation.  This youth organisation was in conflict with our own </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>organisation.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a> The East London Youth Congress started fighting with the other youth </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>organisation.  Their battle ended up at my own house.  I have children, but fortunately </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>at home I had members of the East London Youth Congress.  The other group came </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>together with other girls.  If it was only the ANC, I am not scared, I could name them, </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>but we are mixed and you are going to capitalise on that.  I am not going to divulge </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>the names, but what I wanted to say that since I was released from Robben Island I </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>could not be employed, therefore, I employed myself and I told people and I told </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>people about the ANC.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>ADV SANDI:  Excuse me Sir.  Could you go back to the pamphlets.  You were </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>saying that these pamphlets referred to you as an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>MR MNYUTE:  Yes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>ADV SANDI:  Did people believe that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>MR MNYUTE:  In politics, you see, those who are against you they go and spread a </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>bad spirit about you.  Those who are working with you listen.  This issue about being </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>an informer, you see, I had combis.  They said that I am using these mini-busses so </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>that the other youth group can fight, can be fought with the aid of these mini-busses.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>ADV SANDI:  When the other group came to your house were your cars damaged or </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>perhaps your furniture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>MR MNYUTE:  No, it was not on that day.  After a while Comrade Msawuli and </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>Sitho and other Comrades were called to Lusaka.  They came back.  After they came </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>back I think that there was a conclusion that something should be done about </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>informers.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>ADV SANDI:  We have to focus on the matter of your house being bombed.  Perhaps </p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>not go into other details.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>MR MNYUTE:  When I came back from Lusaka, apparently I had been called to </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>Lusaka as well.  I said I knew nothing about it.  The day Comrade Msawuli was </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>beaten up I was also beaten up on that very same day.  I was beaten up at 12 midnight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>ADV SANDI:  Were the perpetrators found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>MR MNYUTE:  No, because the Ciskeian Police together with the perpetrators </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>worked together, they were in cahoots.  They were scared of me however.  They did </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>not know what I was going to do.  Secondly, after they had bombed my house what </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>saved me was my mini-busses were parked almost against my wall.  The grenades they </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>threw into the lounge my wife leapt and I jumped over her, right over her so that she </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>would not be injured.  However, she got greatly injured.  Then they threw yet another </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>one around the dining room.  That hit the wall and went back to the cars.  It damaged </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>the cars.  My wife was injured.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>ADV SANDI:  Were there other people who were injured in the house except for </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>MR MNYUTE:  I was also injured.  The children, fortunately, were not injured.  It is </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>just my wife and I who got hurt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>ADV SANDI:  Did you go to hospital to get some form of treatment together with </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>MR MNYUTE:  After we had taken my wife to hospital she was admitted for six </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>months.  I was only in hospital for two weeks.  I do not, I thought only of revenge.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>was thinking how I am going to organise my own boys to fight.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>ADV SANDI:  Where was your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>MR MNYUTE:  She was in hospital at that time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>ADV SANDI:  Did she heal totally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>MR MNYUTE:  Yes, she is in the Transkei.  She is a soldier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>ADV SANDI:  You would like us to investigate this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>MR MNYUTE:  It has been a while, asking for the truth, wanting this matter to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>investigated.  I was also saying that those people who said that I was an informer must </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>also come forward.  They must come and say who I sold out.  They  must be </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>investigated, they must come.  The ANC must try to pay for the damages.  My </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>children I cannot look after them well.  My one child is at university.  Mandela himself </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>must come and himself must investigate this matter.  I was working underground as </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>well.  I will give him names.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>ADV SANDI:  You also requested that people like Vusumzi Artwell, Bawule and Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>Msawuli their matters be investigated as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>MR MNYUTE:  As a matter of fact the ANC should have looked at these matters a </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>long time ago, but because of the respect and discipline of our organisation we thought </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>we should wait and see what the ANC would do, because Msawuli and I were </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>working together also Sitho.  We kept on thinking that the perpetrators would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>found, the ANC would find out who they are, but that is not how things go.  The ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>itself, in my perception, has been infiltrated a lot by the enemy.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>ADV SANDI:  Let us not get into that Sir.  I trust that that is all you have to say.  If </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>my colleagues have questions they will ask.  Thank you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  We thank you both.  We remember the time of folly when our </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>people were fighting against each other.  It was painful.  I think it is true when you say </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>that truly the organisation should handle this matter.  The ANC that is.  People died.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>The community should have gotten together, walked hand-in-hand for the liberation of </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>the struggle.  It makes me angry really, because it is painful to see our own people </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>fighting against each other.  Msawuli was a brave man.  This should not have </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>happened to him.  Thank you.  Mrs Msawuli, you cannot mention peoples' names, </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>unfortunately, in the hearing.  These people should be given a notice 21 days before </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>the hearing.  However, you can go to our investigators, give them the names and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>will investigate the matter further.  Thank you.  You may step down.  </p>
