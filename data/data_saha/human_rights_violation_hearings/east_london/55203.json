I travelled with my wife in my van.  We came back.  It was on a Monday, we left on a Saturday then we came back on Monday, when we came back the children told us that there were people who arrived here and they were called Peace Forces. I didn't know what they meant by these forces because I was employed for a long time, those children that I have now I was a worker in Cape Town, so I didn't know what they meant about the Peace Force, because it was only two weeks when I came back from the.....\n So when we returned from where we went our children told us they were surrounded by the Peace Force in our absence.  Those people were in Sandile there at the kraal of our King Sandile.  I usually see these people even today, but my children are the only ones who can identify them.",

She said I must take the children to her place.   I brought them along.  There were two children, the deceased and the other girl.  I wanted the person to accompany me.  I was ordered to bring the car in the yard.  I was suspicious and asked them why do they want me to bring the car in the premises, and then they said no nothing is going to happen to you, you may come in.  Nolizwe came out and I showed her these two children and this person who accompanied me.
