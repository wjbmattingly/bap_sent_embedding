In the afternoon, late afternoon, before sunset, I was going to go to a church service, but I just did not feel good so I did not go.  At about five o' clock the first person to enter my house was Toto Ngqeza who is sitting next to me.  He got into the house, walked to the kitchen.  He looked at me strangely with everybody around.  I asked if they had all come back from the funeral.  He said that something had happened, however, at Highway.  There were shootings.  I asked where Deliswa was.  He looked around.  Toto, where is Deliswa, I asked, where did you leave them?  I went towards the door.\n One of my sons walked in.  He looked morbid.  I asked Toto for the third time where Deliswa was.  He then said she has been injured, she had been shot.  I walked out, walked towards the gate, but I went back into the house.  I walked around the street.  I wanted to go to where she had been shot.  I asked Toto where my daughter was.  He said that they had taken her.  My husband arrived from a meeting.  There were people who heard the news at Highway, they also came.  They thought that they should go to the police station as Toto had given a report that Deliswa had been taken by the police.  I wanted to go, but I was told to stay.   I went to the taxi somehow, but then got back home.  I was going up and down, I did not know what I was doing, frantic.  Eventually I settled down.\n They came back at about ten in the, at night saying they are from the police station.  They could not get any leads.  They were told to come back the next morning.  They went to the police station, they did not get any proper leads.  On the Tuesday they were told that my daughter had passed on.",

I woke up from my sleep.  I started praying, asking the Lord for forgiveness.  I was not supposed to have gone to a legal representative.\n During the times when I was surrounded by enemies, my Lord was always with me on, at my side.  He spoke then and even now he was speaking.  I asked for forgiveness for having gone to an attorney.  I got up after having prayed.  I said to my husband we should leave everything to rest, because so much had been revealed to me.  I did not know whether the Lord had taken my child for a reason that he had seen in me.
