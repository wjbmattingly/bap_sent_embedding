Well he drove off with his car, he came back with small plastic bags filled with naartjies and he said, \"This is yours, this is for my sister\", I can't remember the third one, he said, \"I know my sister is very fond of nuts\".

I said to, \"Oh My Lord, why does he make me cook so many pots on Sunday?\", because I was supposed to prepare the normal food.  I said, \"Okay I will\". He went out with his car, he came back again and he asked me, \"Did you cook my soup?\" I said \"No I haven't yet started cooking.  I will start it as soon as I finish.

The police were outside, you know, they kicked off my door and they asked, didn't you see any youth, I said no I didn't, nobody came in, couldn't they see that the door that they kicked was closed. Surely that would be an indication that there are no people in this house.\n You know at that time there was a child underneath the bed, I was talking alone, this child was restless and I took a cloth, I tried to clean while talking, hiding this sound that was coming from underneath the bed.  Well the police left and I opened the wardrobe.  They thanked me for helping them, another game.  \n Across the street there were police there, it was after the rally.  There's a big place of reeds. A policeman came from that area and asked us why we urinate close to the kraal, and he replied, this is our place, our tradition tells us to urinate very close to the kraal. You know, this hefty man picked him up, he was so hefty that his feet \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n6 N MPEHLO\ncouldn't touch the floor, and then he was thrown into the back of the hippo.\n After hearing this, on the other side, these youths arrived at my place with guns.
