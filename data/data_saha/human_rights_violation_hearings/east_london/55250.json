I think the Commission has to make a request to those people who were close to Geoff to come forward.  As you have already said, if he did something to the organisation he was working for and if a decision was taken to kill him that must be known.  If there was conflict we have to know, that if this was done by the police the truth has to come out.  People are saying different things about Geoff.  As a result of that we do not know whether he was a leader to be respected in Mdantsane or he was killed because he have done something wrong.  We would like that to be clarified and we have seen that this affected you very, this affected you.
