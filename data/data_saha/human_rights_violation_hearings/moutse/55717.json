            "This Piet Sithole was abducted at home in the morning when we were just waking up and they were put in the lorry and they took him with.  It seems they were taken to Gobokwane.  After some time my son returned.  He was running.  Then he said to me let us rush to go and see my father at the clinic.  When we arrived at the clinic we found them, they were badly assaulted.  His head was chopped and we could not identify him.  Then he was taken to MOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n2 M SITHOLE\nthe hospital.  When I tried to go in the ambulance they said what are you going to return with so you had better stay behind.  Then I was left behind and then the following day, then my aunt went.  The following day I went to look for him at the hospital, but I had some problems, but I arrived.  He was badly injured.  He was not able to talk.  On the body you could see some wounds.  \n Thereafter in the morning we phoned to Mrs Sithole.  Then Mrs Sithole informed us the person died immediately after we left.  Then we took him to bury him.  After the funeral, after two months or three months the police arrived at home.  Then he said he is from Dennilton.  He is responsible for the case as we wanted to find out what happened and how he was killed.  He said to us we should come to Dennilton to get the whole information and they gave us a date.  I called all the family members and then I brought them to Dennilton.  On that day we went to Spepoero.  When we arrived at that place we could not find any information and we tried to ask.  Nobody answered us.  Then we returned back and that policeman who was working at Dennilton and who was responsible for this case then said he is Mr Ngobeni, but on that day at Spepoero he was not there.   We went back up to this day.  I had five children at that time who were students and then the elder one was not at school at that time.  Four of them are at school.  After some time I was unable to pay their school expenses.  They were trying to look for work and they were not able to find one.  They are not even working up to this day.  I was getting the old age pension.  That money is not enough to support my children.  As from 1986 I started to, I became cardiac.  I am not able to support my children or take them \nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 M SITHOLE\nto school.  This little money I get is for me to go for medical treatment.  I do not know as from then what happened and why they were killed and how they were killed.  I am still in the dark.  I will be happy if I may be informed what happened.",

If we call names of people from what we believe instead of from what we know, makes it exceptionally difficult and also the accusation hurts when a person is accused and might not have been involved.  So, we have got to be ten times more careful in the future, as not to be naming people if we want to live in unity and reconciliation except if we have the evidence to support it.\n It is common cause that your husband was taken away by people.  It is common cause that he did die.  There is nothing much that we can help you with except to tender our sympathy and condolences and to hope and pray with you that somewhere in the future you will also find meaning to his death.
