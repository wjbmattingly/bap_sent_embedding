            "On the 8th May, it was around 7 pm, I went to my friend Frans Nawe.  After 30 minutes being with him I found him with Semlope and Solemo Sepe. Whilst we were still there we heard some sounds outside.  When we were listening to those footsteps we saw a white policeman at the door.  He was with other black policemen.  What they did when they arrived there they asked me, because I was near the door, that they are looking for Frans Nawe whom I visited.  When I answered them I said I don't know the name of that person because I am selling oranges, because I was sitting next to the crate.  Then they asked Frans what was your name.  Before they asked him they showed us their identity cards.  There was no electricity at that time, we were using paraffin lamps.  Then he looked at that, then they asked him what is your name, then he had to tell them their name.\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n2 MOTSEPE\nThat time when they were asking there was one who was looking at me, then he said they must hold me with the belt and take me outside.  They took me outside, they tightened my hands.  After that they put me in a car and they drove towards Pitskraal road.  When they arrived at the Marble Hall Matete road they turned left.  That is the road which goes to Seobuswa.  Before they arrived at Seobuswa they turned left again. Then I thought it is Habekwange.  Then they stopped there.  Then they asked me what is your name. I didn't tell them my name at that time because I didn't know whom I was talking to.  Then they drove back to Komhlanga.  When they arrived at Komhlanga I was beaten that night up to dawn the following day.  They left me a little bit and they took off the sack cloth.  The following day in the afternoon they took me again to beat me.  They took me again to the cell.  On the third day they did the same again, asking me as to whether did I know Frans Nawe and many other people, together with Chief Matebe.  Then I said I know Chief Matebe as the chief.  They told me that that is not true.  You are a group of people who are telling the Moutse residents to deny to be ruled by the Kwandebele government. Then I told them that I don't know that one.  The following day I was taken during the day around about ten they took me to their office and showed me an album.  They were asking me people who were on those photos.   Some of the people there I knew them.  Then they said will you tell us where are they.  I said no, I don't know.  During that time when they were questioning me they were asking me about a certain car where they got it at a scrapyard and they found that car written that it is owned by me.  Then I told them the real story that I was there and I did request\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 MOTSEPE\nthe people at the scrapyard to come and pull the car.  After two o'clock they left me and took me to the cell.   Then the following day I was taken, they dropped me at Matete.  I walked on foot to the taxi rank and there was no transport there.  I looked for accommodation.  The following day I went home.  At home I stayed for a day then I went to Alexandra.  Then I went to the clinic there.  I was treated at the clinic.  Then from there I came back home.  I know that I completed three weeks.  After those three weeks they came again and found me.  They found me at Siphiwe Nchali's house.  At that time Siphiwe was not there.  He was imprisoned, then I was visiting his mother to find out how his wellbeing is.  On that day I was taken and they beat me and left me on the road.  Then I ran, I ran out of our village.  That was the last time I saw them.",

Now the killing of Mr Fourie and his son is much later.  Is there a mistake in the statement, in those dates or are you just a bit confused given that these events took place so long ago?",

We will see, we do have Captain De Jager here and when he has a chance to come to the witness stand we will ask him about this incident and what his views are and whether he wants to comment on these allegations which you have made about the arrest and the detention and assault.  But thank you very much for your statement and for shedding some light on the incidents of that period.  It is very important that we clear up some of the factual stuff, especially the dates which you mention in your statement.  So I hope that with one of our statement takers we can clarify that and clear up that confusion.  Thank you very much.",
