<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  We welcome you Mr Petros.  Just relax.   I see that you came alone but we hope that you will be able to relax. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">HENDRIK PETROS MTSHWENI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You are coming to tell us about the terrible incident which happened, the necklacing which happened in your family.  May you tell us about that.  You may continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> My brother was burnt.  He was working at a local hall in Seobuswa.  In  other words he was working for Piet Ntuli and it so happened that he was burnt.   That is what I will tell you about.  He had a supermarket, a very big supermarket.  While he was still at the hall he saw workers running away from his shop.  It was midday, at about 12 o'clock.   The comrades were burning his shop and his workers ran for their lives and he went to his shop to extinguish the fire.  After a few days he was supposed to go to a meeting and he met three people.  They poured petrol on him and they burnt him but he didn't die immediately.  He was taken to Denalton hospital where he died.  Then we went to Denalton as a family.  Nobody knew where he was because he was staying alone at the hall, he was working for my mother really and my mother was far away from here and nobody knew that he had died.  They only heard after a few days because they went to Denalton hospital and they couldn't find him, he was only found at the mortuary in</p>

<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>Groblersdal.  That was after a few days.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> If I understand you well you say he was working for the late Piet Ntuli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> Yes, he was under the leadership of Mr Ntuli.  MR MANTHATA:  ... he owned a supermarket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> Yes, Ntuli had a supermarket.  This supermarket was Piet Ntuli's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Your brother is Piet Mtshweni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> Yes, my brother is Piet Mtshweni.  He was working for Piet Ntuli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> For him to be necklaced at that time where were you, Mr Mtshweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> I was staying in Pretoria at the time, I wasn't here at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> In other words you didn't know the political situation in Kwandebele, do you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> We knew that there was fighting going on in our area and we couldn't just gain entrance easily into this area.  Sometimes we would spend our nights in Pretoria, not coming home.  We couldn't come home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> If I understand you well is that you didn't know that Piet would be in danger as Mrs Ntuli said that Mr Piet Ntuli knew that there are white people who are intending to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> No, we didn't know that.  We didn't know that really.  My brother was working for Piet Ntuli and he had been employed by him for quite a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You say that Piet Mtshweni was staying with the mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> Yes my brother was staying with my mother because he didn't like women, he was staying alone at the</p>

<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>3 MTSHWENI</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>hall.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> Mr Petros you have just said you were staying in Pretoria but you knew everything that was going on around here.  Can you please tell us what was the fighting for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> We heard that the cause for this fighting was independence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> Tell us further. You say people were fighting for independence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> Yes, the people were told to accept independence and some of them were forced to accept independence and some of them said no, we don't want independence.  That is when the fighting started.  I do not know what happened because people were now attacked in their houses.  People at Magomakwane were attacked because they didn't want independence.  People died in large numbers because of this independence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> How was your brother then involved in this whole issue?  Why was he necklaced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> As he was working for Piet he was thought to be in favour of Piet.  You know if I work for my boss I would love him because he pays my salary so they must have killed him for that reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> In other words you are saying your brother was killed because he was working for Piet Ntuli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> Was Piet Ntuli in favour of independence or was he against independence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> Piet Ntuli wanted independence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> And you said your brother was working at the hall at Seobuswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> Yes.  He was working there because Piet was</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>MOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>4 MTSHWENI</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>the administrator of this hall.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> We started on Monday here and we heard many stories about this hall and we were told that people would be taken to this hall by the comrades or the comrades would be taken there and they would be assaulted and the people from Magomakwane were also taken to this hall to be assaulted.  Tell us was your brother killed because he was working at this hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> Yes, I think he was a group of people who used to abduct people and assault them at this hall.  I think that is the reason for his killing.  He was involved in this abduction of people.  Can you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> Was he working together with the abductors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> Can you please explain that further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> I am saying he was working together with the people who used to fetch communities to this big hall to be assaulted and every time he was called he wouldn't refuse because he would be fired from his position and he had to follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> I thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please audience we will request you to be quiet please.  Lets give the witnesses a chance to be composed and answer all possible questions please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALLY:</span> Mr Mtshweni, another reason that the comrades singled out your brother, in your statement you say that he actually tried to put the fire out when all the other employees ran away.  You said they ran for their lives.  He actually tried to extinguish the fire.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> I don't understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALLY:</span> In your statement you say that when the comrades</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>MOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>5 MTSHWENI</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>set this shop, this supermarket of Piet Ntuli alight most of the other employees, the people who worked for Piet Ntuli, ran away.  They ran for their lives but your brother went back to the supermarket and tried to put out the flames.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> Yes, that is correct.  The employees ran and he went back to the shop, my brother, to extinguish the fire.  And the perpetrators had already gone and they shouted at him, they said we will get you and a few weeks thereafter they met him and they poured petrol on him and they burnt him.  They were actually against him helping Ntuli's burning store.  I mean he was working for Piet Ntuli so he had to extinguish the fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALLY:</span> And you also in your statement suggested that your brother was a member of Mbcobo as well.  Is that also correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> Is it written in the statement, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALLY:</span> No, I am sorry, it is not in the statement.  You say that he was accused of being for independence.  You don't say that he was a member of Mbcobo.  I apologise for that.  But you do indicate that one of the reasons you believe that he was singled out by the comrades was because they saw him go back to the shop and try to put out the flames whereas the other employees when they saw what was happening just left the place to burn.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Mtshweni, I have a question relating - I want to clear up the question of your brother's work situation.  You said he worked for Piet Ntuli.  Was he a shopkeeper, was he a manager of the shop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> He was working for my mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I am not sure that I understand this.  You said</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>MOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>6 MTSHWENI</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>in your evidence that he worked for Piet Ntuli and I think you said something to the effect that you are loyal to the one who pays you. </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> That is correct.  He was working for Mr Ntuli and Mr Ntuli was giving him his salary and he would take the salary to his mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now what did he do for Mr Ntuli?  What was his work for Mr Ntuli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> He was cleaning the hall.  He had to keep the hall clean at all times because it was used for many activities around the township.  He had to take care of the hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was he not a shopkeeper?  Because in your statement, if I can just point this out...</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> He wasn't a shopkeeper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well then that information is wrong and that is what confused me.  He worked at the Seobuswa hall and his responsibility was to keep that in order.  To administrate that.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> He was a caretaker at the hall.  That is all he was doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was he paid by the government or by Mr Ntuli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> He was paid by the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mtshweni, this old woman who was taken care of by Piet Mtshweni, is she still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> You mean the Mtshweni's mother?  Yes, she is still alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> With whom is she still staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> She is with the other siblings of our family.  CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mtshweni we are grateful that you are here. MOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>7 MTSHWENI</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>You will see that we are talking about terrible times in Kwandebele.   We are here to investigate exactly what was happening.  We are looking for the full truth because it is the truth which will give us peace and know that where should we go from now.  That all things which were committed previously should not happen again.  We seek national reconciliation and therefore would say Piet died at the time when there was no peace and he died that there should be peace.  That is why we say we sympathise with you, then you must tell them at home that we sympathise with them and that we are always with them. We thank you, sir. </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHWENI:</span> I also thank you.</p>
