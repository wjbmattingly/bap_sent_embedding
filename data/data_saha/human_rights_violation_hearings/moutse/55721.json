            "... and when I arrived at home that my father left with the police.  We went to bed, our hearts were very sore.  The same night the police arrived the second time and they arrested me.  They were surrounding the whole house and De Jager is the man behind this whole thing.  He took me to the cells and when I got into the cell many people were already there and I was released - this  brother of mine who is sitting next to me ran the whole marathon to and from the cells to check as to whether I was all right.  Until today I never knew where my father was and I was told that my father was released a long time ago and I said to them we don't see him at home, what happened to him then and there was no answer for this question.  My brother went to Witbank to search and he was told that my father had been transferred to Kwaggafontein.  And when we went to Kwagga we were told that he was released a long time ago.  I was working and I do not know what happened thereafter.  My aunt who was supposed to come with me was a witness to this whole issue but she couldn't make it today.  That was the last time I saw my father.  I am here before the Truth Commission to help me trace my father.  If it is possible to get him.  It is ten years already since his disappearance.  If it is really possible for the Commission to trace him. If he is dead we will be happy to get his remains so that we can give\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n2 MAHLANGU\nhim a dignified funeral.",
