They started beating him up and they put him at the back of the lorry.  They took them to the Ndebeles.  They beat them up and they spent the night and brought them back the next day.  They dropped them right on the street and he could not walk.  They transported him by wheelbarrow.  I took him back to the hospital.\n When we arrived at the hospital it was very full, but they attended to us.  They took him by ambulance.  He was hospitalised and I left for home.  His brothers came back from the Ndebeles and they wanted to find out actually what happened.  When the brother came back from him to report to me he told me that the younger brother passed away here at the hospital.  Now I could not do anything, I was helpless. \n I do not have too many things to say.  We gave a long statement to the Commission.  That is why I am only saying my statement now shortly because we already submitted our statement.  I do not have anything more to say.  My witnesses are around this people.  They all know that my son passed away during the conflict in the Imbokhoto tribe and they buried him.  That is my only problem. \nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 D TIJANE",
