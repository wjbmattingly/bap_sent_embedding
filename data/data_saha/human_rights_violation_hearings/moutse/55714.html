<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> We welcome you, Mrs Ntuli.

<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> There are 12 in all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> What are they doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> They are at school.  We cannot just afford them ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> Are they schooling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> Yes, but all of them are at school.   Some of them left school, the elderly ones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> We ask that you tell us more about the things that happened on the 12th July 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>MOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>2 NTULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> On the 29th July 1986, it was round about 8 p.m. they came, a white person telling me that my husband had died.  On that day my husband did tell me that other people, white men, wanted to kill him.  He heard that they were all around looking for him.  It happened that they killed him.  It was clear that they wanted to kill him. He went out for a meeting but I can't remember well at what time.  He went to that meeting.  When they went out of the meeting he never came back home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> How did they kill Mr Ntuli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> They bombed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> What was he doing?  What was he here in Kwandebele?  Was he a member of the parliament?  What portfolio did he hold?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> He was the Minister of the Interior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> What other portfolio did he hold?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> I know that only, I don't know of another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> On the statements that you are having it was clear that Mr Ntuli was a leading member for Mbokoto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> At all times he didn't tell us about his political activity.  The only thing I know is that every day he would wake up and go to work and I know that he was working for the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> What kind of political party or political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> I don't know.  When he arrived with his papers from work then he only told me that he is the Minister of the Interior and that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> Just try to tell us about the situation, the political situation in Kwandebele at that time. What was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>MOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>3 NTULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> At that time the situation was tense and people were burning houses and they were burning shops.  People were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> What is the reason for that kind of political unrest that property was burned, people were killed?  What is the reason if you may think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> People were killing each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> Who was killing who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> I would not know what was the reason for the killings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> I want to know what was the reason.  Those people who have planted a bomb which killed Mr Ntuli, do you know them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> Yes, I know them.  I firstly met them in Johannesburg.  I don't remember the date but I started to know them on the 31st October.  They did confess that they did kill Mr Ntuli.  I didn't know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> When you say you saw them in Johannesburg where in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> At the Truth Commission hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> Was it amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> Yes, it was amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> Did they confess why did they plant the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> No they didn't explain that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> You did say that Mr Ntuli did tell you that the secret police are looking for him.  Did he tell you what was the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> He didn't explain to me the reasons why, he only said that day when he said the security police where he was talking with Judge Mahlangu and they were talking about this thing very seriously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>MOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>4 NTULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> It is surprising that Mr Ntuli was the minister of interior affairs in the government at that time that they were in favour of independence for Kwandebele.  Do you know that?  Did you know that the cabinet of that time was in favour of independence for Kwandebele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> If you don't know it will be very difficult to know that the police were working with the cabinet at that time that this homeland should gain independence.   You don't know why they planted that bomb because you said you don't know that the cabinet was in favour of independence of Kwandebele.  We will leave that point.  We will ask those who will follow you.  However, you have said you have seen these people who said they have bombed your place, how do you feel now after knowing the people responsible for killing your husband because at the time you did not know who was responsible for killing your husband.  How do you feel now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> My opinion is that those people should be brought to book.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> You know that they have applied for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> We don't know whether they would be granted amnesty or not.  I don't have forgiveness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEROKE:</span> We will hand over to Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If I remember well in Northern Sotho when it is like this perhaps the five of you should be having someone who is to be responsible for you, that is from the traditional point of view.  Is there such a man or such a head of the kraal who is directly responsible for your welfare now?  You have said that you do not know much about what was all regarding the independence issue. I would</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>MOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>5 NTULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>assume that you do not know because at that time in Kwandebele women were denied franchise.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NTULI:</span> We didn't have a right as women to get into such issues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We, the Truth Commission, we want to thank you for your presence before us.  We sympathise with you and we feel that the family ties should continue and your role in the community should remain firm, solid and spreading and for this reason the Truth and Reconciliation undertakes to make whatever effort it can to follow up what has happened to you.   Already you have got at least a glimpse from what you got from the Amnesty Committee but we are still mindful of what you have said with regard to the children, the dependants that were left by (indistinct) Ntuli.  We wish that they be brought up within their family atmosphere, within the community atmosphere and we will have all the committee together with us we will see to it that whatever can be possible to make your participation fairly meaningful will be done.  For this we are very grateful and we say please go strong.  Understand the support we offer you. Thank you.</p>
