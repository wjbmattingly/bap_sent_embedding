            "I don't remember the date but what I can then say, let me put it this way.  The CID's came to my home after they arrested Fourie who was working under - he was the lieutenant and I was the warrant officer.  And they came to me with a policeman who they arrested, they said this policeman shot at a person at Matete.   I left with them, we went to the police station.  And when I arrived at the police station I called the now deceased Fourie and I told him that a policeman has been arrested and I said to him Fourie we took his firearm the first time and we told him that he mustn't be in possession of a gun any more and now here he is, he was now involved in a shooting incident and we don't know how he got hold of the gun.  And I said to Fourie do you have a police officer who is on standby to come and investigate this issue.  Then Fourie said to me I do not know, I will check on the list but don't worry, I will personally come and we will go to the place and\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n2 KEKANE\ninvestigate, that is the place where this incident took place.  This man, when they came to my house they were four.  It was a man and a woman and a policeman and this other policeman was arrested and I don't know what happened but  seemingly there was altercation and the policeman claimed this wife from her husband he released his gun and pulled the trigger and this man ran away.  The policeman then took the woman but I don't know how this running man knew that the approaching vehicle was a police van.  He stopped and they went back and they went searching all over for this man and this man's wife.  By then the husband to this wife didn't know that the abductor was a policeman and that is when I called Fourie.  I said Fourie this is a very complicated issue, please send someone who is on standby and he said no I am coming personally.  He asked me how did he get hold of the gun, I said to him Fourie I do not know.  He said I am preparing myself to leave now.  When I arrived in Seobuswa I will contact you and take those people so that we can meet at a T-junction at Motete, that is the one leading to Marble Hall and Pretoria. He said we should meet at that T-junction.  I don't know where he was at the time he contacted me but I think he was at Seobuswa because that was our agreement.  He contacted me and I called the people that were in the office.  The car was parked behind, I said to them let's go and we got into the car and we drove off.  We were heading for the T-junction where we were supposed to meet with Fourie.  When I arrived there his car was parked the other side of the road and I was this other side of the road and our cars were facing each other and I dimmed my lights for him so that he can realise it was me and no reaction from his side and I drove up to his car and I\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 KEKANE\ncouldn't see anybody and I took my car, I drove past so that I can take a turn so that we can park our cars next to each other and I realised there wasn't anybody in the car and I jumped out of the car, I peeped through and I saw this person in the car and I called my senior to come and resolve this issue.  I heard Mrs Fourie referring to Frans.  I think there is a mistake that she didn't understand.  Frans was fighting for promotion.  I am talking about Frans Masiza and they altercated with Fourie and it came to my knowledge that this Frans wanted promotion, he was a constable and he said he didn't want be a sergeant, he wanted to be a warrant officer and if Fourie doesn't promote him he will go to Majozi and he will get that promotion, he will get the rank.  That is what he said.  Many senior police came to the scene then after I reported this.",
