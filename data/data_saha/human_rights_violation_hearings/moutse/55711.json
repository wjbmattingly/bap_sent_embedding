They addressed the meeting and they said Makawe and Skosana are not here, let us postpone this meeting so that the two of them can come.  Then on a Wednesday they did not pitch up at the meeting.   People were dispersed with tear-gas on that day and they took different directions.  They were running away from the tear-gas.  Stores were burnt down, many of them indeed, and the\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n2 MTHIMUNYE\nnext day our area was also on fire.  While we were still surprised we waited a day not knowing what to do and the comrades arrived a day thereafter.  They burnt Skosana's shop, they burnt down his house and they came to burn my house.  We were puzzled, we didn't know what to do, we didn't know where to go.  We didn't really know where to go to.  And they killed my son who was residing at number 2.  His house was burnt and he was also chased away.  He escaped luckily.  He spent two months and on the third month they got hold of him.
