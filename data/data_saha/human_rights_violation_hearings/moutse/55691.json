They told us the reason that they were killed in Siyabuswa.  What could we do because the Siyabuswa people were fighting and we only heard that they were killed.  After some time when they were supposed to be buried the corpse was brought by State people and they told us that nobody is allowed to see the corpse.  We did not grieve for him.  I had quite a problem at that time because nobody cannot afford to not to grieve.  I do not know if it was the Law at that time that people should not be given an opportunity to grieve.  Then we buried him on Monday.\n The following day a white man came.  He said he should be exhumed because he needs to be examined.  We asked them \nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n2 M L BOPAPE\nwhen are they bringing him back.  They said on Wednesday.  What can we say because the Government was saying that.  Then he was, we went to the cemetery and we told them that at the cemetery there is a person in charge.  He told Induna.  They went to the cemetery to exhume the body.  It was just to keep quiet at that time because I did not know what to do.  They exhumed my son and they took him.  We waited on Wednesday. Around twelve o' clock they brought the corpse.  Then they went to rebury him again.  They did not tell us the results of the examination.  All those were known by the State agents.  We were just complaining on our own.  \n After that, that is all I can say, the Bopape family said God will take care of all those things, but the police came again and they just said the police have killed your children senselessly and those people were arrested.  After they were convicted then you will be called to be told of the results.  Thereafter we were not called.  We do not know as to whether the case has been set.  We do not know as to whether it was the practice of the day that the court proceedings would just go on without us being informed.  That is all I can say, but we are hopeless and we just say God will see what to do.  I thank you.",

            "Thank you Your Grace.  Your Grace, this is one of the cases that we have had an opportunity to actually look into a bit.  We did obtain the police docket.  This was an incident during that conflict that we have been hearing about.  There were actually two policemen that day.  The other policemen was David Moradie and it was a routine investigation, but because of all of this talk about Imbokhoto, raiding and that Imbokhoto was going to be coming into the villages, when these policemen arrived they were suspected of being Imbokhoto.  There was a confrontation, shots were actually fired.  One person was killed and it was after that that the crowd then attacked the two policemen.  They were hacked to death, they were burnt.  There was then\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n4 M L BOPAPE\nan investigation, a court investigation.  Eight people were charged.  Eventually three people were found guilty, not of murder, but of assault and with intent to do grievous bodily harm.  That was the charge that they were found guilty of.  They were sentenced a two year suspended sentence and they were told to pay R50.00 for two years to the families of the victims, to the two families.  So they each had to pay, the three of them had to pay R25.00 each and that was to be paid to the families.  Now the issue that we are still trying to find out about is that there is some dispute about the monies that some of the, the claim that not all the monies was actually paid and the last time our investigators were actually looking into that to establish what had actually happened, but that is as far as we were able to establish with that case Your Grace.",
