<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.   Chairperson, the next applicant is General Shoke, he too will affirm and not take the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">SOLLY ZACHARIA SHOKE:</span> (affirmed states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> Gen Shoke, what is your present position in the South African National Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Director ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You've heard the evidence of Gen Nyanda, the evidence he gave about the landmine campaigning in the Eastern Transvaal.  Do you confirm that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Positive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Excuse me, Mr Berger.  You say Director of what?  His present position.  I didn't get his present position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What did you say your present position is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Director of Personnel Acquisition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I think that's recruitment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Positive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Gen Shoke, you've also made an application for amnesty,  Your application, if you will confirm, appears in the bundle from pages twenty-one through to twenty-seven, with an annexure at 28 and 29, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Positive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you've also submitted a statement, which appears in the bundle from page thirty through to page 36, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Positive, although some few corrections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, I was going to get you to say something more than just positive, because I'm now going to ask you, there are certain corrections that you'd like to bring to the statement, the first is at page 33.  If you could just indicate the corrections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Paragraph 8 should be ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That's paragraph 8 at the bottom of page 33, you're deleting the word "urban" from the first sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Positive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And also there was a correction that you wanted to bring under paragraph 6(c) on page , the last sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> To delete "later".</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where it says Transvaal was later split, you say it was split because that split occurred much earlier, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Positive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then finally at page 35, there is a correction, in fact it's an addition, the second paragraph on that page reads that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>"The four landmines were planted, the information collected from reconnaissance would be accumulated and a decision to plant a landmine would be taken, based on that information."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>You wanted to add something there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Although it was the procedure, but it was not always the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That was not always the case.  Alright.  Now in fact, while we're on page 35, we can deal with the command structure of Kletshwayo, which you have listed the people involved there at the top of page 35.  You see that?  The paragraph which reads</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>"The structure responsible for planning and approval of landmines consisted of myself, Siphiwe Nyanda, Jabo Dumane (now deceased), Viva (now deceased) Sizwe (now deceased), Belgium (now deceased) and Little John (now deceased)."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>You confirm that you were part of the command structure of Kletshwayo, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> That's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We also know from your application that you wore different hats, sometimes at the same time.  I want to ask you just in relation to Kletshwayo, because that's  all that this application today is concerned with, the landmine campaign, what was your function on this command structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> I was responsible for hardware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What does that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Weaponry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, no.  What does it mean when you say you were responsible for hardware?  What exactly would you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> That would mean when people, or when operations had to be carried out, the request or a requisition would be made to me and then I'll go to hide out, or hiding place and let them take out the necessary equipment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you responsible for providing that equipment, that hardware to the cadres, or was there someone else on this command structure who would act as an interphase?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> I think maybe this Committee will appreciate that we were operating on a need-to-know basis and hardware was one of the most delicate equipment to be handled and if you just give it direct to the individuals, you were exposing yourself to a serious danger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you wouldn't hand it straight, directly to the cadres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who was the person who would interphase between you and the cadres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> In our structure, actually, I was liaising very closely with Viva.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Viva being the Chief of Operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then as far as operations were concerned, did you have any knowledge about the exact operation, when, where, or was that left to the unit on the ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> As much as, actually like I said earlier on, we were operating on a need-to-know basis, what I think I want to make clearer in this Commission, that I take responsibility for all operations that took place while I was there, whether directly or indirectly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you say directly or indirectly, can you explain what the difference is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Indirectly in a sense that I was part actually of the command structure, and therefor I was part of the collective that made decisions and indirectly in the sense that I might have provided the equipment to carry out that particular operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In the sense that, when you talk about indirectly, you mean not physically involved in planting the landmine at the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Positive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But nevertheless, you don't dispute your involvement in the entire operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> We were a collective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And for that you take responsibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Positive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> For all the landmine explosions that occurred under the command of Kletshwayo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Positive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Berger.  Ms Mtanga, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> I have no questions Chairperson, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MS MTANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you. Panel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Just one, if I may.  General did you give any specific order or instruction to the third applicant, Mr Mkhonto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> No, not directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you know him as a member of one of your units?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> I've got no questions, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> During which period were you involved in this particular operation, this campaign?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Ever since its inception, until I think the beginning of 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would the inception have been in 1985?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Towards the end of 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> End of 85?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have any knowledge of incidents that might have involved the persons that are listed on page 3 of the application papers as victims?  You can just have a look at that.  Have you got any knowledge of any of those people, possible incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> I might not have knowledge of their names, but like I said, I take responsibility because it would be difficult for me to remember the names as to who is who.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So your position is, if these people were injured in incidents that fell within the campaign, then you take responsibility in respect of those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Positive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm not sure if you do refer to that in your statement, so I won't rely on my recollection, I'll just ask you, General Nyanda refers to six incidents on page 17 of the papers.  Do you confirm those as incidents that fell within this campaign?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Positive, although actually like I say, that I take in fact responsibility for all the incidents.  There might be others that are not listed here.  Gen Nyanda left early in Swaziland, while I was still there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But just so as to be able to identify more concretely some incidents, these one here you do confirm, these six on page 17?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> It's difficult to maybe single out incident by incident here, because these things happened a long time ago, but I move from premises that we were responsible for the landmines in the Eastern Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And on the basis of Gen Nyanda's evidence, let's assume that this was, as he testified, this was part of the campaign.  On that basis you would take responsibility for that as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, just for the record, you're looking for a statement in Gen Shoke's statement, at page 35 there's just the sentence, just before paragraph 13</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>"I do not know how many incidents took place but I accept that the ANC is responsible for all landmines planted during that period."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Yes, I've got it, thank you Mr Berger.  Yes, you do confirm that Gen Shoke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">GEN SHOKE:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Yes thank you.  Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I have no re-examination thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Gen Shoke you're excused.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson, the last applicant is Sgt-Maj Dick Mkhonto.</p>
