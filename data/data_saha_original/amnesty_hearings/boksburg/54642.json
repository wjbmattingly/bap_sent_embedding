With me was female Constable Strydom and a Sergeant Human.    \n\tWe booked her out of her cells and took her to an office numbered 11.   There I offered her a chair.   She sat down and the rest of us also sat down and then I warned her according the rules of the law.   I told her that I was Captain De Waal and that I was connected to the security police and I was stationed at John Vorster Square.   I gave her the opportunity to read my certificate of appointment.  She read it.   She took her time to read all the particulars on the appointment certificate and she was satisfied that I was the person who I said I was.   After that, I told her that I had been tasked to question her in the presence of the other members of the police services, and that what she would say would be put on record, and that any other admissions could be used as evidence against her if she were to be prosecuted.   She said that she understood that.\n\tI began with the questioning.   I told her that during the initial stages, I would like to have an historical report from her regarding her political involvement with right wing organisations, as well as that of her spouse, as well as an historical report regarding herself.\n\tShe told me that she had been born in Australia.

This fund originally was intended for the Volksfront to purchase two-way radios and that was decided to use that for the legal costs of Derby-Lewis.   I personally was against Mr Hani's murder, because we had information that Hani and Mandela wanted to establish a party.   I reported that to Roodt, and Roodt took control of this operation and saw to it that this would not go to Clark.   This cheque was banked on the 3rd of March 1993.   Hani was murdered on the 10th of April 1993.   I and Roodt came to hear of the murder on the 10th of April 1993.   There was no conspiracy with the AWB, the Volksfront, to murder Mr Hani.
