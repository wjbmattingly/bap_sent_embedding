In pursuance of \nwhat Mr Bizos said, I suggested to the Committee that we will \nhave it transcribed, and this developed subsequent to the \nadjournment period.\n\tMembers of the Committee, we have already submitted \nheads of argument and subsequently heads of argument have been \nreceived from the members of the family.  These heads were \nreceived on the Thursday and unfortunately they were received \nlate.  Mr Bizos had other obligations, but we will leave it at that.\n\tHonourable Chairperson, our heads have been discussed \nthoroughly under various topics.   I would like to refer to a \nnumber of aspects with reference to the testimony and in light of \nthe fact that further new evidence was submitted, since the \nsubmission of the heads, and if preferred as such, we could submit \nwritten heads of argument in response to Mr Bizos' heads of \nargument to the Committee.\n\tI would like to argue with respect that the applicants firstly \ncomplies with the provisions of the relevant Section 21(c) and \nwith specific reference to the applicant's action in support of the \nConservative Party, that he believed on a bona fide basis that he \nwas supporting the cause of the Conservative Party.  With \nreference to the aspect of his actions in support of the \nConservative Party, I refer you to the judgment of the S v Maloi \nand others in SA Court Reports, 1987 1 (196) (A), judgment of \nPresiding Appeal Court, Judge Boshoff, and specifically on page \n210, H - I and also on page 211, and 212 H - I.\n\tWith respect in this respect, I would like to argue that in \nthat judgment it was necessary that the party had to have been \naware of the actions which were undertaken by the applicants.\n\tIt is my argument that under these circumstances the \napplicant who was an Executive Member of the Consecutive \nParty, acted in support of the Party.  There is no evidence to the \ncontrary which supports that the applicant acted maliciously or \nacted in any way for his own interests or to promote his own \ninterests.\n\tThe Committee with respect, should consider what the \npolitical history of the country was, which preceded all these \nevents, where the country was governed by a white government, \nwhich consisted of the National Party, later the Conservative \nParty and the National Party which devolved by following a \ndifferent policy and had a vision of a unity State and the \nConservative Party's vision was that of separate development and \neach nation governing itself.\n\tThis was the strong policy of the Conservative Party which \nwas not negotiable according to them, and in short, it took place \nthat the party according to the evidence of Dr Hartzenberg, the \nleader of the Conservative Party, that the democratic process at a \nstage, was closed and that negotiations would serve no further \npurpose and that according to the evidence of Mr Derby-Lewis, \nthe Codesa negotiations were overwhelmed or dominated by \nmembers of the Communist Party and as seen by the Conservative \nParty, communist rule was at the order of the day and with \nrespect, this fact was a fact according to the people and the party \nwho believed that there was a threat which was eminent and that \nthere was no other option but to mobilise on all fronts, there was \ntalk of war.\n\tThere was a climate of war.  Yesterday evidence was given \nabout it again, Visser and Clark, Dr Hartzenberg have all testified \nin terms of this, the applicants have testified in terms of this, and \nat this stage there are applications for amnesty which indicate or \nwhich go as far as May 1994.\n\tI would like to argue with respect that it was not indicated \nto the contrary that it could be said that there was no state of \nundeclared war.",

If you have a look at \nthat and you look at her handwritten statement, volume R4, just \none minute please, specifically regarding the firearm and the list \nMr Kemp provided, if you look at the statement of Captain de \nWaal in Exhibit AC page 2 where he says at the bottom regarding \nthings which are unclear and there are things which do not \ncoincide with her husband's statement.  In other words he knew \nwhat Deetliefs had said and he said he did not know.  \n\tFurthermore he said she stated that her husband never \nindicated a firearm, while her husband during questioning did \nindicate a firearm.  She went further, saying that she now \nremembered.\n\tIf we look at the statement, her handwritten statement, \nparagraph 66 on page 158 of the typed version, it's page 159, \nparagraph 72\n\t\t\"then that Cuba had possibly done the deed and Clive \nand I later confirmed that Cuba had used the gun \nwhich Clive showed me one day in the house (with a \nsilencer).

            "That's correct Mr Chairman.  Just a moment \nplease.  If you take into consideration that Mrs Derby-Lewis, \ninitially during her incarceration while she was questioned by \nDeetliefs before she was under Section 29 but she did not have \nlegal representation, under each question she said\n\t\t\"No answer, no comment.\"\nafter that she was under Section 29 and van Niekerk said\n\t\t\"She had to talk.\"\n\tMr Chairman, then I want to submit that these statements of \nhers do not have any value for the Committee to use it against the \napplicant because they were taken under those circumstances.  \nWith respect Mr Chairman, this Committee is aware of what \nSection 29 entailed.  Today there is evidence of how people were \nhandled to get the necessary information.  Today it's not a law \nanymore and today it could even be claimed to be \nunconstitutional.  \n\tThere was an instance, I don't have the Judgment, where in \na Civil Case they wanted to present a statement in a case of a \nwitness being held under Section 29 and it was argued that that \nSection was unconstitutional and it could not be relied on because \nof that.  This also makes sense in this regard.\n\tMr Chairman, if you look at the statement taken or made by \nMr Derby-Lewis and under the circumstances - firstly on the \nvideo recording, I think it's video recording number 3, it is \nclearly indicated how Mr Derby-Lewis begged Mr Deetliefs that \nhe needed a legal representative and he said he could not make a \nstatement under those circumstances.  You could see on that \nvideo recording, it speaks for itself how he acted under those \ncircumstances and Mr Derby-Lewis afterwards, how he was \nbroken down and then he made a statement.  \n\tWhat is the value then of a statement made under those \ncircumstances and furthermore where he is told\n\t\t\"We are going to lock up your wife.\"\nHe said he was protecting his wife and that was just natural, \nwhile he knew that that list which was used was a list presented \nto his wife by Arthur Kemp.  That was a list from him to her and \nthat had a certain connection with his wife.  With respect, it was \njust a natural thing to protect his wife.\n\tIn his evidence he told us how he obtained the list.  He said \nhe saw the list in Cape Town, he described the circumstances.  \nDoctor Hartzenberg supports the fact that documents were placed \non his desk by Mrs Derby-Lewis, he supports her evidence.  There \nis no reason why Doctor Hartzenberg would tell a lie about \nsomething like that.\n\tAnd shortly Mr Chairman without using anymore of your \ntime, these statements have little if no value at all, these \nstatements which were taken under Section 29.  And the \nCommittee should rely on the evidence provided by Mrs Derby-\nLewis in this regard. \n\tMr Chairman, the evidence regarding the list.  We \nunderstand from the family that it is alleged that there was a big \nconspiracy, that apart from these two applicants it's also alleged \nthat Mrs Derby-Lewis - and also regarding the way in which the \nfirearm was obtained - I've already referred to du Randt and Mrs \nVenter, Mr Venter's evidence was that Mr Derby-Lewis asked for \na weapon for stockpiling. \n\tWith respect, under the circumstances there is no evidence \nto the contrary and why would he tell Mr Venter that he was \ngoing to murder somebody with that weapon and then broaden a \nconspiracy which would have been unprofessional to do, to \ncommit such a deed.  \n\tThe same applies for Mr du Randt.  And it seems from his \nstatement made to the police, that he is innocent.  Mr Derby-\nLewis could not tell him anything, he was in custody.  He could \nnot tell Venter because he was in custody.  Mr Venter acted on \nhis own behalf.  \n\tRegarding Mr Kemp, during the trial and receiving further \nparticulars the State said that Mr Kemp was not a co-conspirator. \n In the Court Judge Eloff also treated him likewise.  Mr \nChairman, this list with 19 names was faxed to Mr Kemp from \nMrs Derby-Lewis, it was an open fax line.  At that time, and it's \nno secret, telephones were tapped and faxes were intercepted so \nsomebody would have been stupid, if it was a secret, to convey it \nin such a manner.\n\tShe leaves those 19 names on her computer and the police \nhad access to that computer.  She knew then that on the 12th of \nApril that list would become involved and that would be damning \nevidence.  If she - why would she then leave that list on the \ncomputer, Mr Walus had already been arrested and there was a lot \nof fuss in the media?\n\tHonourable Chairman, Mrs Derby-Lewis was found innocent \nduring the trial, why would she now here, she has no reason now \nto come and say \"I was not a co-conspirator\", there's nothing for \nher to lose.  If she comes here and says she was a co-conspirator \nshe could have made an amnesty application, she knew her \nhusband was applying for amnesty for perjury or anything like \nthat.  She does not apply for amnesty because she believes she \nwas not a co-conspirator.  \n\tIf you look at these statements written by the police, they \nwant to involve her, those parts which were put in.   And in the \nend it looks as if for the police that later on she could have heard \nabout these things but she did not know it in the planning stages \nwhile planning an assassination.\n\tWith respect Mr Chairman, Arthur Kemp was the author of \nthis list, he is the person who decided about this list.  That was \nhis evidence in the Supreme Court,  he compiled this list, she had \nno control over that.  And right from the beginning she said she \nrequired that list in order to obtain information to write certain \nthings in the Patriot and a lot has been said about that.\n\tWith respect, look at the list itself.  Should it be a murder \nlist one would have expected that there would have been full \nparticulars.  For example regarding Mr Chris Hani, all you find \nthere is an address that says nothing, it's insignificant.  It can't be \nregarded as a murder list.  ...[intervention]",

            "Then I would like to deal with Section \n22(a) which I would present to the Committee.  This is the \nsection which reads that the offence for which the applicant is \napplying should be a deed which is related a political objective.  \n\tI would like to present to the Honourable Committee that \nthe applicant was a member of the Conservative Party.  It is \nargued that after the deed the Conservative Party apparently said \nin the media that he was not a member of the Conservative Party. \n I would like to argue to you that that indeed was his testimony.  \nMr Hartzenberg testified and he made no mention that he was not \na member of the Conservative Party.\n\tThe applicant presented his background, his birth in Poland \nto the Committee and his experience of the Communist Party.   I \nwould like to present to the Committee that his background in \nPoland and his experience of the Communist Party was not \npresented to the Committee in order to say that he had developed \na hatred towards Communists on that basis and that is why the \ndeed was committed, but if one studies his testimony it is not \nindicated in any other way.  He did this in order to say to the \nCommittee that he knew what would happen if the country would \nbe ruled by a communist dispensation.\n\tThe applicant immigrated to South Africa and because he \ncame to South Africa he became involved in politics, although at \nthat stage he was not a citizen of our country and could not \nparticipate in elections.  From the initial stages he realised that \nchanges were taking place in the country and he became closely \ninvolved with the Conservative Party's breaking away.  \n\tAt that point he was quite aware of South African politics \nand he realised, as it is set out, that the policy which prevailed at \nthat point was about change and that there might be a possible \ncommunist dispensation in government.\n\tHe met Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis during 1995 and became \nfurther involved in politics and assisted the Conservative Party \nwith elections and by-elections.  And after he was granted \ncitizenship in 1988, before that time in 1985 he also became a \nmember of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging and when he was \ngranted citizenship in 1989 he participated in his first election in \nSouth Africa.\n\tHe also testified that he realised in 1990, when the \nANC/SACP was legalised, that there was a definite problem which \nwas developing in South Africa and he believed that there would \nbe  an ANC/SACP rule in the government.\n\tHe was also present when Dr Andries Treurnicht delivered a \nspeech at the Voortrekker Monument in May 1990 where the third \nstruggle for freedom was mentioned.  And he testified that during \nthat meeting Dr Andries Treurnicht swept or called the masses of \npeople who attended the meeting, called them to battle.  And \nafter that he attended negotiations where the Conservative Party \ndecided that they should ready themselves for a possible war.\n\tIn 1992 he was also further involved, and he testified \nregarding that, he was involved in the referendum which was to \ntake place and it was decided afterwards that the democratic road \nwas most definitely for the Afrikaner, as definitely closed for the \nAfrikaner nation of which he regarded himself to be a member.\n\tThe applicant who was involved in politics as I have just \nargued, was more involved with the second applicant, Mr Clive \nDerby-Lewis, and his politics. What appears very strongly within \nhis testimony is that he as an immigrant from Poland.  He came to \nbe under the influence of Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, that he regarded \nhim as a political leader and not just a politician and he also \nregarded him as one of the policy makers of the Conservative \nParty.\n\tAfter the referendum in 1992 it was very clear to the \napplicant that the CP and the other right-wing groups - and I wish \n to argue that it should be considered that he was also involved in \nAWB meetings.  AWB was one of the right-wing groups and the \nAWB was not and is not a political party.  The members of the CP \nbelonged to the CP as a political party and to the AWB as a right-\nwing organisation.  It is not to say that the members of the AWB \ncould not have been Conservative Party members.\n\tDr Ferdie Hartzenberg testified - and I'm still dealing with \nthis under the fact that this offence occurred within a political \nstruggle as Section 22(a) determines, Dr Ferdie Hartzenburg \ntestified that it was not the policy of the CP, the written policy \nwhich they as a political party expressed or carried out.  Violence \nwas not their policy.\n\tHowever Dr Ferdie Hartzenberg's testimony must be seen \nvery thoroughly as an entirety.  He testified that during \nAugust/September 1992, after the signing of the Record of \nUnderstanding that was between the National Party and the ANC, \nthe CP realised that it was now involved in a political struggle. \n\tUp until that point the CP had achieved quite a level of \nsupport in politics.  They won a number of by-elections and it \nbecame very clear that the Conservative Party which at that point \nhad already become the opposition, if there were to be a general \nelection the voters - that would be before it was an open election \nfor all population groups, the CP realised that it might able to \ndefeat the National Party.  But with the undersigning of the \nRecord of Understanding the CP realised, and this was made clear \nfrom every platform from their supporters, that now there was an \noverwhelming struggle and that the Afrikaner nation's freedom \nwas in danger because if the ANC/SACP Alliance came into \npower, the Afrikaner nation would lose it's freedom.\n\tAnd the policy - this is his testimony, the CP's policy was \nto strive for the freedom of the Afrikaner nation and it did not \nchange since the establishment of the Conservative Party.  Now \nwith the signing of the Record of Understanding, this freedom of \nthe Afrikaner was put in danger and that is how the CP regarded \nit and it was also expressed as such.\n\tHe also testified that it was very clear to the Conservative \nParty that the ANC and especially the SACP under the leadership \nof Mr Chris Hani would not grant the Afrikaner nation it's own \nterritory, they wanted a unity state.  And he also testified about \nan army which Mr Hani had ready, with 10 000 troops if the vote \ndid not swing in favour of the ANC and the negotiations for the \nunity state would be enforced with violence.\n\tThe testimony of Dr Hartzenberg continued and said that as \na result of this political struggle which existed or ruled the \ncountry at that point - it cannot be seen as anything else, the CP \ndecided to mobilise in all areas, not only religiously or in the \neducational sphere, on all levels.\n\tThe CP mobilised to resist the ANC/SACP Alliance in terms \nof the threat towards the Afrikaner nation.",

The policy of the Conservative Party was to ensure the \nfreedom of the Afrikaner people and if Mr Hani, if he was in \ncontrol of the country, then the Conservative Party believed that \nthe Afrikaner people's liberty would be destroyed.  Then, as a \nresult of that point of view of the CP and the right-right, the \nright-wing together with the CP because they were part of the \nCP, then they became involved in a political struggle and then \nthey propagated violence. \n\tThe Conservative Party and Mr Hartzenberg cannot get \naway from that fact.  Their followers heard about violence and \nthat they had to use to protect their liberty.\n\tIt was also clear from his evidence that the political \nstruggle was, and he said \"The National Party betrayed the \nAfrikaner people and the struggle after the legalisation of the \nANC/SACP and the struggle was then against those \norganisations\".\n\tMr Chairman, in my heads I also referred to 22(d) and I \nwant to submit that in order to qualify for amnesty, the applicant \nhe had to make full disclosure of the offence and according to \nwhich - this article, he is applying for amnesty.\n\tA lot has been said about the fact that there was wider \nconspiracy than only that between these two applicants and then \nbecause of the application there was not full disclosure.  I want \nto put it to you that the applicant's evidence indicates that at the \nend of 1992  he was in Europe and after his return in December \n1992 he made contact with Mr Clive Derby-Lewis.  \n\tBefore he had left for Europe this struggle in the country \nwas already going on and when he returned in December this \npolitical situation in the country was discussed further.\n\tHis evidence is, and there's no other evidence contradicting \nthat, that at that stage the political situation in the country was \ndiscussed and not at any stage that they then decided that \nanybody had to be eliminated.\n\tIn February 1993, the applicants visited Mr Clive Derby-\nLewis again and then received the instruction and the planning \nwas made to murder Mr Hani.  It is evident from the first \napplicant's evidence that Mr Derby-Lewis provided a list to him.  \n I want to argue that should the Committee find that Mrs Derby-\nLewis, based on her statements based on Section 29, as Ngoepe \npointed out to Mr Prinsloo, if the Committee finds that Mrs \nDerby-Lewis knew beforehand that there was planning being done \nto murder Mr Hani, I want to submit that the applicant, Mr \nWalus, had no knowledge of this whatsoever.   He did not know \nthat which Mrs Derby-Lewis knew, there is no indication.\n\tEven in the Section 29 statements or any other evidence, \nthere is any indication that Mr Walus knew that Mrs Derby-Lewis \nknew what her husband - Mr Walus did not have any knowledge \nthat he discussed it with her.",

The applicant undertook to execute \nthe elimination of Mr Hani on his own and on that very same day \nwhen the order was given to him he requested of Mr Clive Derby-\nLewis to issue him an unlicensed firearm.  They also discussed it \nand it was decided that Mr Hani's home would be reconnoitred \nand early in March 1993 they reconnoitred the home of Mr Hani a \nnumber of times in order to establish the routine and movements \nof the home.  \n\tOn the 6th of April 1993, he visited Mr Derby-Lewis at his \nhome after an invitation from Mr Derby-Lewis to have breakfast \nthere that morning.  On that day the unlicensed firearm was \nhanded over to Mr Walus.  There was a discussion which involved \nthat Mr Derby-Lewis would provide him with further ammunition \nand the silencer which was fitted to the firearm could not be used \nwith regular ammunition.\n\tOn the 7th of April, Mr Walus once again contacted Mr \nDerby-Lewis or visited him in order to determine whether any \nchanges had been made to the plans and whether he had managed \nto gain ammunition for him.  At that point he had not received \nany ammunition.  According to Mr Walus' testimony the only \nfurther suggestion which was made to him was that the \nelimination be undertaken before the Easter weekend.\n\tOn the 10th of April a Saturday, Mr Walus went, not with \nthe purpose to shoot Mr Hani on that specific day, according to \nhis testimony, he went for his regular exercise at a certain sports \ncentre.  Thereafter he decided or the place or facility was closed \nbecause it was a public holiday and he decided that he would do \nfurther reconnaissance.  He had tested the weapon on his \nbrother's small holding and found that the silencer could not fire \nautomatically.\n\tHe then decided that he would buy ammunition with his own \nfirearm licence which would be the same ammunition as for the \nunlicensed weapon.  He took a drive to go and do further \nreconnaissance at Mr Hani's home.  From the testimony of Mr \nWalus you can see that it concurs with the testimony given in the \nSupreme Court.  And on that day he saw Mr Hani in front of his \nhouse where he was climbing into his vehicle and there were no \nbodyguards present.\n\tInitially he thought that it was Mr Hani but he wanted to \nmake certain and he drove along behind the vehicle until it came \nto a shopping centre where Mr Hani\nclimbed out of the vehicle and was positively identified as Mr \nHani.  Thereafter when Mr Hani departed, he took another road \nand stopped behind Mr Hani's vehicle whereupon he climbed out, \ncalled out his name, Mr Hani reacted to that, he turned around \nand Mr Walus shot Mr Hani.  He shot him four times.\n\tThereafter he departed and from the Court case his vehicle \nwas identified by Mrs Harmse and Mr Walus was arrested shortly \nafter the events.  \n\tIn terms of Section 21(c), that is on page 21, it is clear that \nit is required by law that the applicant provide a full disclosure of \nall the relevant facts regarding the events.  If there are certain \nsmall issues which might not have any bearing matters which were \nemphasised during the hearing, especially with regard to Mr \nWalus and his actions, his brother dead after the glass works were \ndeclared insolvent, these details are of minor import and not \nrelevant.\n\tI would like to submit to the Honourable Committee that \nthe applicant has made a full disclosure of all the relevant facts \nand the legal counsel of the family and the SACP have submitted \nthe statements before the Committee. And the so-called \nstatements which Mr Walus would have made to Captain Deetliefs \nand with the intention of the submission of these statements to \nthe Committee, the intention is to make it clear that there are \nfacts which the applicant did not disclose and there is a greater \nconspiracy.  \n\tThe applicant was arrested and detained in the Benoni \npolice cells and it would appear quite clearly from the \ndocumentation that he did not want to make any statement unless \nhe had legal representation.  He was taken from the cells by \nvarious police officers and interviewed or questioned by various \npolice officers until, on the 14th of April 1993, he fell into the \nhands of Captain Deetliefs.  \n\tHe was once again taken out to his residence by Captain \nDeetliefs, taken back to his cell and on that day, the 14th of April \nthe applicant said to Captain Deetliefs that he would like use his \nright to silence and did not wish to make any statements unless \nhis legal representative was present.\n\tOn the 15th of April 1993 until early morning hours of the \n16th of April, the applicant the applicant was questioned for 11 \nhours and according to Captain Deetliefs notes were taken which \nare not available.  No statement was taken from the applicant on \nthat particular evening.  \n\tIn the early morning hours the applicant was placed back in \nhis cells, that is on the 16th at twenty past five.  That very same \nafternoon, at 16H05 he was once again taken out of the cell and \nonce again questioned for approximately 14 hours and yet again \nnotes were not taken and no statement was taken either.  \n\tThe early morning hours of 16 April 1993, approximately \n04H15 that morning the applicant began, according to Mr \nDeetliefs, to cooperate.  That is so, the applicant has confirmed \nthis.  The applicant confirmed that he cooperated as a result of \nthe fact that Captain Deetliefs caught him or tricked him and by \nmeans of lies he led him to believe, this is Deetliefs, that he had \ninfiltrated the security police, that they were actually cooperating \nwith Tienie Groenewaldt and that if he would cooperate it could \nresult that Mr Holmes, who was the investigating officer in this \ncase at that time, would not make any further arrests and that \nDeetliefs was actually working for the right-wingers.\n\tThe applicant in his testimony stated that he was extremely \nnaive and he realised this later, it was naive of him to believe \nCaptain Deetliefs.  The only notes which are available from this \nquestioning, from which point on the applicant would have been \ncooperating, would the hand-written notes - just a moment please, \npage 84, 85 and 86, that would be in R4.\n\tThere are the only notes from all these hours of questioning \nwhich were provided by Captain Deetliefs and can be provided.  If \nthe video cassettes are watched it is logical that there wouldn't be \nany notes, however in Captain Deetliefs' statement which is to be \nfound in R4 continued he at several points mentions that notes \nwere taken down by Mr Beetge.  \n\tThat cannot be so because he could not make a statement to \nthe Attorney General of the Witwatersrand, Mr Klaus von Leerus \nat that time, in which he would state, in terms of everything that \nhad happened, that he was infiltrating the police and working \nalong with Tinnie Groenewaldt and that is why there weren't any \nnotes.  But what is shocking is that he says on numerous times in \nhis statement that notes were taken.\n\tThese are the only notes ...[intervention]",

And it is also \nsaid in various places in the statement that the applicant was \nwarned according to Judges' rules.   It does not appear on the \ncassettes and it won't, it cannot because the Honourable \nCommittee must understand and it was conceded by Advocate \nBrand, that the applicant had been misled.  Captain Deetliefs \ncould not have warned him because they were busy with \nclandestine discussions where Deetliefs would be assisting the \nright-wingers, why would he warn them then?\n\tIn my heads I submitted to the Honourable Committee that \nCaptain Deetliefs was a liar and that he's nothing else but that \nand that the video cassettes and the statement are proof of that.\n\tThe applicant told the Committee that at a stage he had \ndriven past Mr Mandela's home at that point and the translation it \nwould appear, the English of the applicant in the statement is \nquite clumsy, one does not know how the translation came \nthrough from the Polish to the English but he said that it was put \nto him - I don't have it here at the moment, it was asked of him \nhow he managed to obtain the address of Mr Mandela and he said \n- and he continues, I must concede, but as, and there is such \nproof, the home of Mr Mandela appeared in the Citizen \nNewspaper and according to the applicant he drove past simply \nout of curiosity.\n\tI submit to the Honourable Committee that the target which \nthey had discussed and which was pointed out by Mr Clive Derby-\nLewis was only Mr Hani and not Mr Mandela.\n\tIt was also put to the applicant during cross-examination \nand it is also supported, that there was a conspiracy to murder \nthe others whose names appeared on the list - and I refer to R4 \non page 308, where Captain Deetliefs once again - this is point 2 \non page 308, once again it is\n\t\t\"Captain\"\nI have never seen a policeman make this kind of statement, \nnonetheless\n\t\t\"Captain Cuba, do you think there is a \npossibility that others on the list could \nstill be eliminated after your arrest\"?\nthen it is\n\t\t\"Yes, they are all bastards.

One can see \nBeetge's hand, they are planning to help the right-wingers.  \n\tAnd Deetliefs will say \"They don't want to discuss it too \nopenly because it's supposed to be a secret\".  Then Deetliefs says, \nwhile they are discussing who will be the successor of Hani, \nDeetliefs says, and this is not the applicant, Deetliefs proposes \nthat Sexwale would be the possible successor.  Then Deetliefs \nsays that \"Sexwale is a bastard\", upon which the applicant \nanswers -he's sitting there and this was recorded within the \nprison, he's sitting at the table with his head turned and he says\n\t\t\"They're all bastards\".\n\tOn the same tape further on, the typed 1301, Deetliefs is \nstill in discussion with the applicant and he expresses great praise \nof Clive Derby-Lewis, that he is such a wonderful man, that \npeople trust him - this is Deetliefs speaking, and then they discuss \nthe fact that Clive Derby-Lewis was involved with the \nWitwatersrand ...[indistinct] and then the applicant makes the \nfollowing remark\n\t\t\"Clive Derby-Lewis is a good man, he is a man of \nballs - he's a guy of balls\".\nexcuse me.\n\tWhat is contained there on page 308 does not exist. It is \nnot that it was interpreted incorrectly, it simply doesn't exist at \nall.  That which Deetliefs had written here was his own story.  He \nhad taken discussions with the applicants, written it down to suit \nhis own purposes.  \n\tHe also wanted to try to prove that there was a greater \nconspiracy at hand because already from that point when the case \nwas being investigated, foreign investigators were called in to \nassist with the investigation but it doesn't end there.  I have \nsimply highlighted those sections with regard to which the \napplicant was cross-examined, but it is absolutely frightening to \nwatch those tapes.\n\tOn page 301 - I'd like to refer the Committee to this, \nDeetliefs here makes a very long statement and it is here where \nhis style changes - I don't know if he became tired, but now \nassumes a sort of discussion form of what the applicant had said \nto him.

            "I am not unmindful of the point made judge.  What I \nam saying is that like in the case of accomplices, we don't reject \nthe evidence of an accomplice because he originally made the \nstatement to the police that he didn't know anything about it, but \nwhen the matter came nearer home to him, he made to confess to \nthe crime, but what we do require in relation to the evidence of \naccomplices is that because by nature they are unsatisfactory \npersons who were prepared to lie, we do not accept their \nevidence unless there are cogent reasons to do so, bearing in mind \nthat the oath at times doesn't mean much or anything to them \nwhen their own purposes are to be served.  I do not want to take \nit further than that, and I would certainly not make myself guilty \nof submitting that because he lied nothing that he said here \nshould be believed.  \n\tWhat I am submitting is having regard to the fact that he is \na person who was prepared to lie under oath, who said that his \nlegal representatives were responsible for his being found guilty \nbecause they did not give him proper advice and they did not give \nhim any reasons.  I don't want to repeat everything that he said in \nthe application, I want to take it now further than that and most \ncertainly do not submit that as you have indicated judged, most if \nnot all of the people have denied it in the past particularly if they \nhave been tried, but tremendous caution has got to be exercised \nin accepting the evidence of Mr Derby-Lewis so that when a \nmember of the Committee asks a question of Counsel, where is \nthis, merely to be pointed to a statement made by Mr Derby-Lewis \nwithout comparing that statement to what he said in his \napplication for amnesty, to what other witness have said and what \nthe probabilities in the case are, it is not enough to merely say Mr \nDerby-Lewis and Mr Walus said.  That's as far as I want to take it \nand I will deal specifically in relation to some of the self-serving \nstatements made by Mr Derby-Lewis which we will submit can not \nbe relied upon in order to apply it as a fact and in turn apply the \nlaw.\n\tLet me deal with Mrs Derby-Lewis.  She too admitted that \nshe lied to the Judge President of the Transvaal Provincial \nDivision in relation to the circumstances under which the list was \nhanded out, which is a matter on the very core of the matter.  \nAgain we cannot accept the evidence of Mrs Derby-Lewis merely \nbecause she has said so, we will have to have regard that she is a \nperson who is capable of lying under oath and who obviously has \na very strong desire to get her husband's release under amnesty.\n\tNow as far as Mr Walus is concerned, he too has \ncontradicted himself in relation to vital matters between the notes \nthat appear in R4 and particularly pages 362 and not the pages \nthat have been quoted by Counsel for the applicants and also, Mr \nChairman, the issue here is not what may or may not be on the \ntape, the vital passages that we rely on were read to Mr Walus \nand if you have a look at pages 98 and subsequent pages of the \nsecond record, you will see that he has for all practical purposes \nadmitted to have said the things that were recorded, but we will \ncome to that in much greater detail.  So that again what we would \nappeal to the Committee to have regard to, that the matter is to \nbe decided on with a more, with respect to Counsel for the \napplicants, a thorough examination of the facts than they have set \nout in their written heads of argument and have made submissions \nhere.\n\tThe other matter Mr Chairman that we want to say about \nthese three witnesses and in this regard I would join Mr Clarke as \nthe fourth, because he falls into the same category that there \nattitude to the fundamental changes that were taking place after \n1990 and more particularly the preparatory changes to have a new \nconstitution from 1993 onwards which was being prepared at \nCODESA was absolute anathema to them.  I do not think that we \nwill be overstating the case Mr Chairman, if they are described as \na clique or small cabal of fanatics who irrespective of what the \npolicy of their political party may have been, partly as a result of \nwhat may or may not have happened in Poland as far as Mr Walus \nis concerned, partly because of deeply felt and fanatical religious \nbeliefs, they set themselves up as saviours purporting to be \nmotivated by a religion for the vast majority of the people in the \nworld preaches peace, is an excuse to commit murder by trying to \npersuade the committee that they were really after the Antichrist \nrather than the person described in evidence by Mr Jeremy Cronen \nas the person that had done so much in order to bring \nreconciliation to the country.\n\tWith those preliminary remarks I now want to turn Mr \nChairman to page 1 of our written heads and there we submit at \n4.1 that the assassination of Mr Hani was not committed on behalf \nof, or in support of the Conservative Party.  And we submit that \nthe CP had not adopted violence and most certainly not murder as \none of their means to wage its political or ideological struggle \nagainst the African National Congress, its allied organisations or \nany other organisation.  And more particularly, and this I would \nlike to add having listened to the questions by members of the \ncommittee, and particularly there was no policy of assassination \nof a political leader with a high profile, if you would add that on \npoint 4.2 Mr Chairman.  With all the difficulties that we have had \nin our violent past, Mr Chairman, the political assassination of \nhigh profile political leaders, if not entirely unknown, was almost \nunknown on the South African scene.\n\tIt has never been suggested Mr Chairman that the killing of \nthe President or the leader of a political party, or someone, \nwhatever one's views may have been about their actions, the \ncountry's problems would be solved by killing them.  When I say \nnever, we of course have the notable example in this case where \nare going to submit it was proved that it was not only Mr Hani \nthat was on the list for elimination but also Mr Mandela, Mr \nSlovo and other political figures in the country in order to create \nthe chaos that the two applicants have spoken of.  We submit that \ntheir act could not have been permitted in the course and scope of \ntheir duties because the CP had not advised, planned, directed, \ncommanded or ordered assassinations as one of it's means of \nwaging political struggle.  Mr Derby-Lewis told us what his \nduties were, Mr Walus hardly had any duties to perform in regard \nto the Conservative Party except to possibly help with elections.  \nSo that in the course and scope of their duties, advised, planned, \ndirected or commanded or ordered by the political party.\n\tIn order to answer this question we have to say, what were \ntheir duties and was it within the purview of their duty and were \nthey ordered to do it?  One can understand Mr Chairman the \nsecurity policeman who said that I was given the duty of \nsafeguarding the security of South Africa, the politicians made \nthe decisions that this is the society that they wanted, I was a \nservant, my duty was to protect people.  The politicians \nidentified, or my superiors identified Mr Goniwe to be \nassassinated, in the furtherance of my duty, I did it.  How do \nthese two applicants bring themselves, having regard to the duties \nthat they had to perform, vis a vis the Conservative party into \nsaying that it was in the course and scope of their duties as \nmembers of the CP  Mr Chairman?  There is no such evidence and \nin our submission the applicants haven't even applied their minds \nto that question and therefore on that ground amnesty should be \nrefused.\n\tBut let's go further Mr Chairman; 4.4, the CP had not given \nany express or implied authority that assassinations of political \nopponents was sanctioned and you may notice Mr Chairman that \nwe actually draw a distinction between the assassination of \npolitical opponents of high ranking and I would ask high ranking \npolitical opponents in Section 4.4 because it is in the South \nAfrican context a most unusual thing.

            "Yes Dr Verwoerd was but not at the instance of a \npolitical party, by a madman.  The two applicants do not contend \nthat they were mad. I can think of no assassination of a political \nleader in the country at the instance of another political party Mr \nChairman, but it may be that I had missed something along the \nway, I don't think I have.\n\tWe then go on Mr Chairman on 4.5, the applicants can not \nrely on any implied authority or perception that violence and \nmore particularly a high ranking political leader, was one of the \nmeans of struggle in view of the standing within the CP of the \nsecond applicant and the close association between the two \napplicants who are clearly on their evidence co-conspirators \nrather than inciter and incite.  \n\tNow again Mr Chairman, where did they get this authority \nfrom, we have and particularly on the section of the argument \nthat is going to be dealt with by my learned colleague, Mr \nMalindi, we will give the Committee the references Mr Chairman \nwhere this is documented, we believe that there can be no real \nanswer to the evidence that came to Dr Hartzenberg himself, from \nthe other leaders of the Conservative Party and we will submit Mr \nChairman in so far as credibility is concerned that Dr \nHartzenberg's responses in relation to violence to Mr Venter, is \nwhat the Committee should accept as the truth and not the \npathetic figure that Mr Hartzenberg cut when he gave evidence \nbefore the Committee trying to explain this.  \n\tLet me just say briefly Mr Chairman that for him to have \nsaid that -\n \"I as the deputy leader said a few days after the \nmurder that we were the people with the moral high \nground, we did not use violence, nor assassination...\"\nto come here and try and excuse it on the basis that political \nleaders would not come out with it openly, is a pathetic attempt \nby a discredited politician to help one of his fellow party members \nof a discredited political party out of the difficulty in getting \namnesty.  \n\tAnd what we submit in 4.6 Mr Chairman or 4.5, we will \nrefer to the passages and there isn't only one, such passage, but \nparticularly one of the  passages in answer to the committee \nmember Advocate Potgieter which makes it quite clear on the \nevidence of both of them that they were co-conspirators planning \nthis together and there was no element of inciter and incitee. \n\tWe draw attention Mr Chairman that the word order was \nintroduced into Mr Derby-Lewis' vocabulary after the Max du \nPreez show was shown to him where Mr du Preez offered some \nlegal advice which he took with both hands, not legal advice - \noffered the possibility that Walus may have an additional defence, \nthat it was taken with both hands and Counsel for the applicants \nused the word order intermittently in the heads of argument \nwithout having regard to the evidence that there was this co-\nconspiratorial relationship rather than the one of inciter and \nincitee.  \n\tAnd we say in 4.6 that there are no reasonable grounds \nupon which the applicants can claim that they believed themselves \nto be acting in the course and scope of their duties, and within \nthe scope of their express or implied authority, we will rely \nheavily upon the position of Mr Derby-Lewis' in the Conservative \nParty and if Mr Walus was a co-conspirator and not an incitee \nthen it would follow in his case as well.\n\tBut there is an overwhelming probability that people as \nclose to one another as this, and we submit that Mr Walus would \nnot have given the Committee an impression that he's a weakling \nor a yes-man to anybody's will.  He bragged about his prowess in \nthe statement recorded by Mr Deetliefs and Mr Beetge and \nnothing in his demeanour or in his actions or his absence of any \nremorse on his part and the manner in which he dealt with himself \nin this court, that before this Committee, thus could not have \ngiven the impression that he's a weak person that was mislead by \nMr Derby-Lewis.",

Now I want to \nmake clear Mr Chairman that we submit that the conflicts of the \npast were coming to an end.  Counsel for the applicants said but \nlook what Mr Visser told us that Gen Viljoen was planning, that \nwas, we submit, clearly a conditional possibility, if there was not \na settlement.  As it turned out, General Viljoen himself subscribed \nto the settlement, therefore what might have happened according \nto the plans of the Volksfront at that stage which were not \npublicly known for which the applicants do not purport to have \nbeen acting on behalf of, can be left out of account, we submit.\n\tWhat is relevant and the evidence stands uncontradicted, it \nwas put down in a written statement supported by annexures \nwhich are before you as Exhibit, it's Bundle B which contains, it's \na carefully prepared statement and practically all the statements \nin it are supported by  what Mr Jeremy Cronin now says Mr Chris \nHani said at the time, but we were careful to go to the public \nrecord as to what Mr Hani was saying at the time and what he \nwas saying was obviously gaining ground and obviously not to the \nliking of the fanatics like the two applicants, Mrs Derby-Lewis \nand Mr Clarke.  \n\tAnd it is that, and when their party in April 1993 was party \nto those negotiations, Mr Chairman, how could they believe that \nkilling one of the negotiators and the general secretary of one of \nthe negotiating parties at that process where their own party was \nparticipating be in the course and scope of their duties or that \nthey had the express or implied authority?\n\tIt can be tested in this way Mr Chairman, there was Mr \nLangley there if I remember correctly, there was Mr Hartzenberg \nthere, pride of place for the television cameras of the world \nnegotiating for a settlement, these applicants say that whilst they \nwere in CODESA negotiating a settlement, these two gentlemen \nbelieved that they had express or implied authority from them to \nkill on of the top leaders of the alliance working to bring about \ndemocratic changes.\n\tAgain Mr Chairman, I must refer to these four, and I \ninclude Mr Clarke, to this day Mr Chairman they speak about a \ncommunist party take-over.  They do not accept that we had a \ndemocratic election.  To them democracy means something else \nentirely.  I mention this because we will make some references to \nit in greater detail as to whether reconciliation is about to take \nplace by people who still speak about a communist take-over \nwhen 62 or 63% of the population of this county voted for the \ngovernment that is in power.  They may be fanatics, they may be \nunreasonable, they may be beyond the pale, but none of those \nentitle them to say that they believed that they had express or \nimplied authority.  There was nothing happening at the time to \nwhich they had to react by killing a top leader.\n\tThen we say in 4.8 Mr Chairman that the Act was not \nproportional to the objective pursued in their own version and on \ntheir own version they sought to create chaos, expecting hundreds \nif not thousands of people to be killed during a race war in the \nhope that the riot would stage a coup.  This has been canvassed, I \ndo not want to take up very much more time on it at this stage, it \nwas very important for the proportionality.  But I was actually \nsomewhat surprised by the Counsel for the applicant, Mr \nChairman that the killing of Pieterse led to chaos.  I don't know \nwhy he said that, I would have thought that that would have been \na warning to his client about irrational killing of people because \nwe know that hundreds if not thousands died as a direct or \nindirect result of the wanton killing of Master Petersen on the \n16th of June 1976.\n\tAnd in 4.9 Mr Chairman the relationship between the \nobjective pursued and the act is director or proximate, \nparticularly as on their own version they had not planned or even \ninformed the CP who they claim to have represented or any \nelements, to any elements of the right.  I think that the members \nof the Committee are aware to what we are referring to in this \nregard and I will take it no further at this stage.\n\tNow in relation to full disclosure Mr Chairman, we submit \nthat the applicants have not made a full disclosure of all the \nrelevant facts and have been untruthful relating to when the \nconspiracy to kill Chris Hani was first mooted or entered into; \nwho were the victims of the conspiracy; who had become members \nof the conspiracy and more particularly Mrs Gaye Derby-Lewis \nand others who had procured the murder weapon; who procured \nthe murder weapon and the reasons thereof.  Details of this are \ngiven in the rest of the heads of argument.  \n\tIt is further submitted that the grant of amnesty to the \napplicants would be inappropriate and not in accordance with the \nobjective of the Commission to promote national unity and \nreconciliation in that the act or offence was committed during the \ntime when the country was at its most sensitive stage towards \nbuilding peace, reconciliation and democracy.  The offence was of \nsuch gravity that the chaos envisaged to result from the \nassassination could have led to the death of many innocent \ncivilians.  \n\tWell may I pause here and again refer to the evidence of Mr \nJeremy Cronin as to how near we were to a civil war and the real \nchaos that had been envisaged and the evidence that had it not \nbeen for the leadership of Mr Mandela then as President of the \nANC and Mr Tokyo Sexwale as the Transvaal Chairman of the \nANC, there would so easily have been a blood bath and a race war \nin South Africa.",

            "Probably if it had been more fully drafted it would \nhave been more - it's more appropriate to the proportionality \nargument.\n\tAnd in 5.2 according to the applicants, the struggle \ncontinues and it cannot be discounted that they remain committed \nto the objective of creating large scale chaos which will create \nconditions for a coup d'etat and this is what it was Mr Chairman, \nthis was an attempt on their own version, and attempt at coup \nd'etat and may I add here that nobody articulated more practically \nthan Mr Clarke that we had here yesterday.  \n\tPerhaps if the Committee would allow me a personal \nobservation, the applicants and their counsel thought the world of \nMr Clarke as a witness, we submit that he is so besotted by \nhatred purporting to be a fundamentalist Christian, so besotted \nwith hatred and admiration for the two murderers applying for \namnesty that I would suggest that there is very ....(tape ends)\n.. it doesn't appear in the heads of argument elsewhere,  I might \nas well deal with it at this stage Mr Chairman even though I'm on \nan overview.\n\tCounsel for the applicants dismiss the evidence of Mr \nVisser as fanciful and self-serving.  Yes it may well be but there \nare two inherent improbabilities in Mr Clarke's evidence who \ndenies that anything like that happened. \n\tFirstly why should Mr Visser have gone to Mr Clarke and \nasked Mr Clarke and Mr Roodt to apply for amnesty?  \n\tSecondly, if Mr Clarke is telling the truth that Mr Visser \nwas, he's the fault ..(indistinct) and that the relationship between \nthe two of them had soured by the time of the commission of the \nmurder, why Mr Clarke on his own version disclosed to Mr Visser \nthat there was compromising information in his computer's hard \ndisks?  Since when on the general and particular probabilities \ndoes a witness confide that sort of information?\n\t If we turn to paragraph 5 of page 3 Mr Chairman \n\t\"It is further submitted that the grant of amnesty to the \napplicants will be inappropriate and not in accordance with \nthe objective of the Commission to promote National unity \nand reconciliation in that the offence was committed during \nthe time when the country was at the most sensitive stage \nwith the building of peace, reconciliation and democracy, \nthe offence was of such a gravity that the chaos envisaged \nto result from the assassination would have led to the death \nof many innocent civilians.  According to the applicants the \nstruggle continues and it cannot be discounted that they \nremain committed with the objective of creating large scale \nchaos which will create conditions for a coup d'etat\".\n\tBut now Mr Chairman, amnesty is provided in relation in \nrelation to coup d'etat in paragraph E and by the usual argument \nof that which included excludes other possibilities.  It was only \namnesty to be given any person in the performance of a coup \nd'etat to take over the government of any former state or any \nattempt thereto.  So this was a coup d'etat, it was not for the \npurposes of preserving law and order.\n\tWe turn in paragraph 6 to  6.1  The failure to make full \ndisclosures.  We submit that Mr Derby-Lewis has lied about the \ninvolvement of Mrs Derby-Lewis in the compilation of the hit list \nand the reasons therefor.  \n\tDerby-Lewis testified that he first saw the list of the nine \nnames in Cape Town when Mrs Derby-Lewis showed it to him as \npart of the gravy train story which was to be used by Dr \nHartzenberg in Parliament. We submit that that's false Mr \nChairman. This could not be true because in January 1993 when \nMrs Derby-Lewis telephoned Arthur Kemp and sent him a list of \n90 names it was after she and Derby-Lewis had discussed it and \ndecided that unless something dramatic was done the country \nwould be controlled by a communist.  \n\"Clive and I therefore highlighted the names of \npeople whom we believed to be the enemies of South \nAfrica\".  \n\tThis comes in R4.251, paragraph 43.1, we are going to \nargue Mr Chairman in due course that their statements are \nadmissible as the ruling of the Committee indicated and that \nweight should be attached to it.  We will refer you, not to \ngeneralities or the cross-examination put to Mr De Waal, but to \nher own statements that she is unable to deny that this is what she \nsaid and that she made that freely and voluntarily despite certain \ndiscomforts that she says she suffered under. If that statement of \nMrs Derby-Lewis is admitted and what we say is that we must \ntake it together with the probabilities; the probabilities of this \nclose union between these two persons and having regard to the \ncharacter of Mrs Derby-Lewis, we are not dealing here with a \ncompliant housewife, we are dealing with a high profile \npropagandist in the Patriot who in her exaggerations and fanatical \nstatements probably has no equal and who has a mind of her own. \n No serious step in relation to the preparation of this list would \nhave been without her consent, and what we say at the bottom of \npage 4, 'on 29 April 1993 whilst in detention, Mrs Derby-Lewis \nwas shown three pages compiled as the hit list and recognised \nthem as the list of names and addresses that she had given to her \nhusband.  This is evidence that Mrs Derby-Lewis knew of what \npurpose Mr Derby-Lewis needed the list.  \n\tOf course Mr Chairman, I'll remind you at this stage that \nshe denied flatly before the Judge President of the Transvaal as it \nwas then known, that she had given the list to anyone, she made \nup a fabric of lies about it being left on her coffee table with \ncopies of the Patriot which Mr Walus may have mistakenly taken.\n\tWhen Mrs Derby-Lewis compiled the original list of 19 \nnames, she knew that the people whom she and Derby-Lewis \nconsidered to be enemies of South Africa were to be murdered, \nthat after she had received the list of 9 names, Chris Hani was \ntargeted for elimination, that the houses of the people identified \nfor elimination would be reconnoitred and that Walus the one who \nwas going to assassinate Chris Hani and we give you the passages \nin R4 Mr Chairman.  When cross-examined on why she needed \naddresses of certain people that she could either telephone or \nvisit their offices, Mrs Derby-Lewis gave some preposterous \nanswers.  Although she didn't think Hani would give her a private \ninterview in his home, she still wanted the address so that she \ncould see the way he lived.  The answer is absurd, if she was not \ngoing to be allowed into the house in the first place.  \n\tMrs Derby-Lewis gave totally unsatisfactory and evasive \nanswers to members of the Committee Mr Chairman about why \nshe would have wanted to interview certain people who appear on \nthe list and as to why she didn't visit certain journalists or \ntelephoned them at their homes instead of seeking their addresses \nthrough Mr Kemp.  \n\tWe give you the references; it was a long exchange Mr \nChairman and we submit that it bristles with improbabilities.  It is \nsubmitted that the reason she has for compiling the list be \nrejected and that it be found that the list was compiled as a hit \nlist.",

They wanted an order and in answer to \nJudge Wilson as to why Walus marked it 1 to 9, is a ridiculous \nanswer, with respect.  You'll recall that it was in order to speak \non the telephone by number, and I think it was the chairperson \nthat asked well if there was only going to be one, why talk in \nnumbers anyway? So that a list is some evidence that this was or \nwas intended to be a wider conspiracy than we have heard of \nhere.\n\tThe other of course is, criminal investigators in the \nadministration of justice thrive on it.  Many of the people that \nplan similar crimes are just stupid.  In the Goniwe matter they \ndropped a name plate, otherwise the Goniwe people would just \nhave disappeared for ever.  It is the sort of thing, the sort of \noversight or the sort of conduct which makes investigation \npossible.  But certainly what it is not, is a list for journalistic \npurposes because we have the evidence of  Mrs Derby-Lewis in \nthe criminal trial.  \n\tWe will refer you to the passage Mr Chairman where His \nLordship Mr Justice Eloff holds the evidence to be highly \nimprobable.  However in that criminal trial there was an onus \nwhich had to be discharged and probabilities were not enough.  \nThe Committee here, and this is why she could not be convicted \non the second count of conspiring to kill the people on the list, \nbut here we had the additional evidence, their own statements, we \nhave the evidence here of what Mr Derby-Lewis admits to doing \nwhich was not before His Lordship Mr Justice Eloff and I would \nsubmit that although the Committee will accept the learned \nJudge's view that it was highly improbable, what has come forth \nsince, that Mr Derby-Lewis indeed had this list, that he did get it \nfrom his wife, that he did give it to Walus, that he and Walus, on \ntheir own version had planned the assassination, so that claiming \nthat this was an innocent list on the probabilities was unlikely for \nJudge Eloff correctly, for this Committee it is beyond reasonable \ndoubt.  \n\tThat is the submission that we make in relation to the list \nand Mr Derby-Lewis lied about it, Mr Walus lied about the \npurpose of the list, Mrs Derby-Lewis lied in relation to the \npurposes of the list.  Therefore in relation to lack of full \ndisclosure, if our submission is well-founded that all three of \nthem knew that there were to be more than one victim and at least \nanother appears in the list of nine, then each one of them has \nfailed to disclose the truth.\n\tLet us take it on the probabilities.  After all we only have \nthe wrong-doers testimony to work on and it may well be that \nnone of them was expressly prepared to say or Walus was not \nprepared to say that I knew that this was drawn up by Mrs Derby-\nLewis and I knew that it was a hit list for the nine, if the \ninference can be drawn, and we submit clearly that it can, that all \nthree of them knew what they were doing and what they were \nsaying about the nine people on the list, there has not been full \ndisclosure, that neither of them is entitled to amnesty and it is a \npity that the safeguards of double jeopardy, Mrs Derby-Lewis \ndoes not have to answer any more to Mr Hani's death in a court \nof law.",

            "Although that is a theoretical possibility, the \nadmissions of Mrs Derby-Lewis in R4 exclude it \nbecause she says, I can read the passages now - 251 \nof R4 Mr Chairman.\n\"In January 1963 I telephoned Arthur Kemp at the\nCitizen in Johannesburg and said I was going to send\nhim a list of names and that I wanted a description of\ntheir houses and addresses.  This was done after much \nserious thought and because Clive and I felt that \nunless something dramatic was done the country \nwould be controlled by the communists\".\n\t\tNow may I just for one moment deal with the \nquestion of admissibility and weight at this stage?  This is \ncompletely consistent with what all of them said.  So how \ndoes it help the applicants to say that words were put into \nthe mouths of Mrs Derby-Lewis or Walus or Mr Derby-\nLewis? \n\"Clive and I therefore highlighted the names of people \nwhom we believed to be the enemies of South Africa. \n Certain names were added to the list I sent to Arthur \nsuch as Justice Goldstone and certain newspaper \npeople.  Goldstone's address was needed to determine \nwhere he lived because I wanted to do an article on \nhow he who helped to break down the Group Areas \nAct was now living in a white are far away from the \nresults of his 1984 Govender Judgment'.\nNow it also says something about Mrs Derby-Lewis Mr Chairman, \nnot an unformed person, she knows the name of the case.  \n\t'The journalists address were requested because I wanted to \nwrite about them about their attitudes towards the CP.  I \nasked Mr Pik Botha's address because there strong rumours \nthat he owned property overseas.  This has been reported in \nthe in the Afrikaner newspaper and perhaps the company \nwhich owned his property here, if a company owned it, \nwould be the same company which owned the overseas \nproperties.  When I asked Arthur on the phone about \nsupplying the addresses, I did not go into specifics.  He is \npolitically shrewd and I believe that he felt that there was \nno need to spell out why we needed the names.  After all we \nwere on the phone'.\nNow is not that the statement of a conspirator, is that the \nstatement of a person who wanted to write about the gravy train, \nabout which she had already written before and had shouted it \nfrom the roof tops?  Why would she not want to discuss it on the \ntelephone now.  I'm reminded the clandestine way in which Mr \nClarke has bothered to take it to the Rotunda and to hand it over \nto him in his absence or out of his hearing on his evidence if he is \nto be believed.  \tThat's not a list but we go further.  On page \n252, paragraph 44, certain of the names on the list we believe to \nbe the enemies of South Africa.  \n\t'Clive and I had vague plans in the beginning that some sort \nof arrangement should be made to liquidate one or perhaps \nmore leaders of the ANC and the SACP Communist Party.  \nThe people on this list whom I believe to be the enemies of \nSouth Africa were the participants in 'Operation Vula'.  \nYou've heard the echo yesterday from Mr Clarke who were never \nprosecuted by the government and member of the ANC and SACP \nCommunist Party.  Some of the names were Maharaj, Hani, \nMandela Kasrils, Naidoo, Ramaphosa and Slovo.  \n\t'Clive and Kuba decided on Chris Hani to be eliminated \nbecause of his particularly brutal record and his position as \nchairman of the SA Communist Party which they believed \nnever should have been unbanned.  Clive and Kuba wanted a \ndescription of the residences and I can only assume that this \nwas to determine what sort of security surrounded the \nhouses.  I simply asked Arthur what was asked of me; I'm \nnot a logistics person, nor was I present at any discussions \nin '93 between Kuba and Clive about logistics', \nnot about the conspiracy, just the logistics.  \n\t'It does not  mean to say I am denying that discussions \nbetween the two of them were not going on.  Clive told me \nsometime in March that he and Kuba had decided about \nChris Hani as the person to be eliminated.  I don't know \nwhat Clive and Kuba discussed about the other enemies \nmentioned on the list, Arthur Kemp phoned ..' \nmay I pause here.  \n\tHer previous statements make it quite clear that Hani was \nnot alone, there was a whole list, what she says here,\n\t'Arthur Kemp phoned me to say that he had got some of the \naddresses I had asked for and I asked him to fax them to \nme.  I asked  him to fax the street address and the \ndescription of the residence referring to the ANC/SAC \npeople and the description of the residences referring to the \nANC/SAC people'.  \nI suppose she didn't want a description of Mr Justice Goldstones \nif she's telling the truth about the article and not if he was not on \nthe hit list, it's possible. And the reporters that she wanted to - it \nmay be that there may have been people there as a camouflage, \npossibly but there is no doubt about the description of the \nresidences referring to the ANC/SAC people and if we look at the \nexhibit with the nine names on, I can't remember whether \neveryone was an ANC/SACP person but certainly the majority, \nbut with these fanatics Mr Chairman, who is an ANC/SACP \nperson isn't a matter of nice distinction as far as they are \nconcerned on the evidence I would submit, but anyone who is not \nfanatically preoccupied with herrenvolk ideas is a communist or \nan ANC person.\n\tThen on page 253 that, \n\t'Arthur and I met at the Rotunda where Arthur gave me the \nnames and the few other clippings for which I had asked \nhim and Arthur told me that he was resigning from the \nCitizen and that he felt tired and was sick of ...(indistinct), \nArthur said that he would be doing other things with his life \nnot connected with this, generally such as statements, \nbusiness and other...(indistinct).  I presume Arthur wanted \nto seem me rather than just faxing the list because he saw \nthe implications of the list and felt he should not fax it to \nme.'\nNow isn't that a conspiratorial way of dealing with things? I will \ndeal with it in due course but what I want to emphasise at this \nstage, that where we have an improbable story told in the \nSupreme Court where ridiculous explanations are given by the \nwitness in the witness box and where we do know that the \nhandwriting on the list is that of Walus, we know that Mr Derby-\nLewis and Mr Walus had discussion on the list, that they were the \nones that planned the murder, it becomes proof beyond reasonable \ndoubt on Mrs Derby-Lewis' false evidence, coupled with the \nstatements that she made which have not been shown to have been \nmade under any sort of pressure, not only that what the applicants \nhave to show that her treatment was such that she was in due \ncourse to lie about herself, about Walus and about her husband, \nshe specifically disavowed any such happening in relation to her. \nShe was specifically asked and we will further commit it to the \npassage by a member of the committee, and I have a graphic \nrecollection of it, \n\t'Despite all these things that happened to you..', \nif I remember correctly, it was the Chairman but I may be \nmistaken.\n\t'Did you tell them anything which was untrue?'\nand the answer was no.  And let us remind ourselves how \nuntruthful she was in relation to the portions that she learned \nwere not on the video which was available.  She blue hot and cold \nand we refer to the cross-examination and these are the passages \nwhich are - if I could refer you to page 402 of R4, it's the \ncontinued portion, R4 continued, 402.  Well could we start with \nItem number 47.\n\t'On the Sunday I saw Kuba's photograph in the newspaper \nand recognised him at once.  I was very shocked but in my \nheart not at all surprised.  There had been a lot of talk \nbetween right wingers of solutions to the problems in the \ncountry'.    \nThis is the evidence her.\n\t'Clive said that he had discussed these things with Kuba'.  \nWell that's true as a fact and of overwhelming probability that her \nloving husband would have told his loving wife.  \n\t'Clive was upset and I asked him what he was going to do'. \nA highly probable conversation after the wife party to a \nconspiracies was speaking to her husband after they found out \nthat the one of the victims of their conspiracy had been murdered.\n\t'He said that during the discussions with Kuba they had \nmentioned such a thing like Hani's death, he said that he \nhadn't thought that Kuba would do such a thing at all'.\nWell it's partly true but certainly not the statement of a person \nwho is being coerced to give evidence against her husband or for \nany other purpose.  \n\t'He did say that he couldn't understand why Kuba had been \nso stupid to drive around so obvious, Kuba was supposed to \nchange the number plates.  He did admit to me however \nthey had discussed it.  Clive did however say it looked like \na set-up, seeing Kuba was caught so quickly.  We suspected \nAPLA, we talked about Hani suddenly talking peace when \nhe was the manifestation of the resistance.  Hani criticised \nthe PAC in the week or two prior to the killing.  Clive \nthought that either APLA, the government or someone was \nbehind it, as it didn't should like Kuba who would go into a \nsituation head-on.  I asked Clive about the gun but he did \nsay he couldn't tell me where he had got the gun from'.\nNow one does not dismiss that sort of evidence corroborative of \nthe overwhelming probability found by Judge Eloff even without \nthis.\n\tThen on top of page 6, during the criminal trial, Mrs Derby-\nLewis had given one other reason for the list to be the purpose to \nwrite a book with Mrs Ida Parker in addition to the list being for \nthe purposes of conducting interviews or for use by Dr \nHartzenberg.  The court held that Mrs Derby-Lewis was not \ntruthful about the list and that here explanations were far fetched \nand that is the reference Mr Chairman to the criminal record.\n\tIn her statement during detention Mrs Derby-Lewis says she \ndid not show the list to anyone in Cape Town including Mr \nDerby-Lewis, that is in the statement and we give  you the \nreference, I submit that it's a correct reference, I don't want to \nread them unless members of the Committee want me to.  Her \nevidence before the Committee that she placed this list on Dr \nHartzenberg's table and the evidence of Dr Hartzenberg that you \nsaw documents on his table in Parliament, placed there by Mrs \nDerby-Lewis must be regarded as false.  Derby-Lewis is correct \nwhen he says that he took responsibility for compiling the list \nwhen he made his statement in detention in order to protect his \nwife.  His wife needed protection because the list was a hit list \nand he and Walus had already been arrested.",
