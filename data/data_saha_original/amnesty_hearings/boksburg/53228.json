Mr Chair, I think from what was just said, it is as far as a political motive is concerned that is, I think that that stands clear that obviously it was politicised.\n\tAs far as the question of full disclosure is concerned, Mr Chair it is my honest submission that, also looking at the events leading to what occurred on that specific day, the question remains who actually attacked who.  I think it was said by Mr Mbatha who said the IFP acted proactively because they knew that they were going to attack and they wanted to defend themselves because, I think it was Mr Mpongosi said, there was women and children and they knew that the ANC were coming from them.  \n\tMr Chair it's my submission that this version of events, or what preceded the actual incident, is to a great extent supported by the witness Mr Dastile, in stating the frame of mind of this ANC group of people before this actual shooting occurred.  Mr Chair if I may I'd just like to refer back to Mr Sithole's application.  He does not deny that he was armed with an AK-47 and he shot at people, and he believes he also shot Mr Dastile, but I think his evidence was, as far as the incident itself is concerned, he said that it was confusing, it was hostile, a shot rang out and he believed that shot to come from the ANC side, and once again referring back to Mr Dastile's evidence that people were armed with machetes and assegaais and kerries, and he specifically mentioned firearms.  Now whether that was a mistake is to be argued.  But I believe it was quite clear that he did mention firearms in that specific group.  Which obviously leaves the question, is it not possible, or indeed the version of the applicants, or Mr Sithole specifically, had said a shot rang out.  I don't think he even goes as far as saying, he presumed the shot came from ANC side and upon that he started firing.  \n\tMr Chairman it's my submission that looking at all the surrounding circumstances I think it's, it wouldn't be accurate to say the IFP as such attacked the ANC.  I think if I might refer to a specific choice of words or the way it was translated by the interpreters, to a question put to Mr Dastile himself, I think he said in discussion between his brother late Mr Dastile and Mr Sithole, Mr Dastile said to him we must not allow the people to fight.

So Sithole right until the last minute tried to get peace, but he wasn't given that opportunity when he went to his people, instead he was given a deadly weapon and told to go and use it, and he basically obeyed, on his version, he basically obeyed an instruction from a leader, which the Zulu thing to do without questioning.",

But then they fill in their applications forms, and if we take your client, Mr Sithole.  He puts in a first application form and he says;\n\"...I got my firearm (which I've always had)\" in brackets, you know stressed, it's mine, no-one else's \"...and I took it\"\n... and he tells what he did.  At that time Magwaza fills in an application form, says look I know nothing, I wasn't there.  Right?  So in other words, then later Sithole changes his application and says yes I got the firearm from Magwaza, and then Magwaza also changes his application form and says yes I was there and explains what he did.\n\tNow first of all doesn't that inevitably lead to the conclusion that they conspired with each other to lie to this Committee.  You know, Magwaza said, don't implicate me, in the first one, he's not implicated.  Magwaza steps aside, takes himself away from the scene, then they both change to this version, right.  Then you get the other applicants, Ndlovu, Mpongosi, and Mbatha, they all say they fired weapons and stuff.  But if you look at their applications they don't make any mention of that.  They say we were there, but I didn't  take my gun, I didn't fire.  They don't mention that.  Okay they explain it by saying well we didn't know the lawyers who took it, etc, that sort of explanation, but they must have conspired as to what, at least Sithole and Magwaza, as to what they should say, certainly in the first application.  How does that deviousness, if I can put it that way, affect their credibility now to such an extent that we can feel secure in saying they've made a full disclosure?",

There were obvious inconsistencies, there were, I think on both sides, but I believe that these applicants are bona fide applicants and that the incident as such was a direct consequence of political instability at the time.  \n\tAnd just getting to the question of full disclosure, I believe that they were truthful in what they said before this Commission, they were thoroughly tested by Mr Cachalia on their versions, and surely it is to be expected, where an incident of this huge scale occurred, that they will not corroborate each other word for word and sentence for sentence.  \n\tBut I think as Advocate Sigodi mentioned the crux of the issue comes down to who actually attacked who and who retaliated as such, and it's my submission that on the basis of the applicants it was, it was obvious that the fight was unavoidable, there was going to be a fight.  And what resulted was, I think, to blame on both sides.  The evidence is that several attempts were made to try and resolve this issue.  There were tempers, there were a bit of a preceding history between the two parties, and this, all of this led to what eventually occurred.  \n\tAnd Mr Chair if I may just, in conclusion, it is my submission that on their applications, to which they testified, the applicants does qualify, or they do qualify, for amnesty as set down should they be found to have fully disclosed all that happened, and as such being my submission that they did, be granted amnesty. \nIf there's anything else that the Commission would like to hear now?",

            "Thank you.\n\tThat then brings this hearing to a conclusion, and also it brings our roll to an end.  We have no further hearings here.  We will reserve our decision in this matter and will endeavour to get out a decision as soon as possible.  We'll have to go and consider the evidence and the arguments that we've heard, and after our deliberations we'll make a decision which will be published in the usual way.\n\tBefore adjourning I'd just like to thank everybody for making this hearing possible.  I'd like to thank the Municipality for making this very convenient and nice venue available to us for this hearing.  The sound technicians who provide us with the sound system which is critical to the success of these hearings.  The interpreters who all day long try to keep up with the fast talking that's going on, thank you very much indeed.  To Ashley, the logistics officer, for setting it all up and ensuring the smooth running of these hearings which have gone very well.  Our secretary Sonya.  Sound technicians.  The catering people who fed us teas and lunches.  Correctional Services for bringing the applicants.  We believe the first day there was a bit of a problem because they were on some sort of task team on a manoeuvre or whatever, but for coming timeously thank you very much.  And for the members of the police service for providing us with security here, thank you very much.  And if I've omitted - and I include thanking the legal representatives for their assistance, everybody, thank you very much.  If I've omitted anybody, I haven't done so on purpose.  Thank you, and it's been very nice to be here in Boksburg.  Thank you.\nHEARING ADJOURNS",
