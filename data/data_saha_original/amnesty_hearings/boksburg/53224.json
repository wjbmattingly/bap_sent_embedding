It was not the fault of anybody involved in the Commission here, so I apologise.  However, we have started.\n\tBefore we commence I'd just like to introduce the panel to you.

On my left is Mr Ilan Lax, also a member of the Amnesty Committee.  He is an attorney from Piermaritzburg.  And I am Selwyn Miller, I am a Judge of the High Court from the Eastern Cape, from the Transkei Division in particular there.  I can assure you this is the biggest chair I've ever sat in in my life.

It is, he says\n\t\t\"...I do not know English or Afrikaans that is why I \t\tam writing in Zulu.\"\nExplaining the reason for the second one in Zulu.  Mr Chairman I took this matter up with the applicant and it is quite obvious that the contents of these two applications are vastly different, in that the first one is, to a great extent, a denial of any involvement, whereas in the second application he clearly states his, his involvement.  Mr Chair if I may offer an explanation for this, it's also instructions from my client that it came to his attention in the time after the first appliation he was assisted by this man, this fellow inmate of his, he said that he was initially of the impression because he was communicating in Zulu and he said that the man that he was talking with in Zulu and English, was alternating between English and Afrikaans, he said there was, appeared to be a gross miscommunication between them.  He indicated to him that he did in fact sign it.  It is his signature, it is a sworn affidavit, but he said it was, it became apparent to him that there had been a problem with the communication between them and Mr Chair if I understand my client correctly he indicated that I believe someone within the prison authorities alerted, brought it to his attention that there might be a problem with his application relating to the first affidavit submitted, and on the basis of that he decided himself then to write a second application.\n\tMr Chair if I might just get back to the fact that I believe at this stage it appears quite clearly that the two of these applications were received together by the Amnesty Committee, or by the TRC. ...(intervention)",

It is true as the Committee remarked, and I believe it was also indicated to me by Ms Lockhat, the problem that arose was that it was registered under different names, or different numbers, and the impression was also created that it was two different persons.\n\tMr Chair what I would like to get at is, I think you also said so yourself, the decision of the Committee I think is purely based on the first one.

If one takes a look at Mr Xaba's application, this is a similar sort of thing, where he's filled in an application form, and then he's put in a little affidavit explaining why he's put in a second one.  But if you look at Mr Xaba's first application form, it's not a sort of complete denial as the other, which probably is reason for the fact that there wasn't a decision made there, because there's no ways that a proper decision can be made in chambers, which involved a gross human rights violation, such as the killing of a person.

Mr Chair I think my line of reasoning would be that the applicant  could consider himself extremely unlucky in the sense that he did indeed submit two applications before, if, as I say it stands to reason, the decision was made, and a conclusion was reached based on only one of those applications, the one which does not favour him, or puts him in a position where, ...(intervention)",

            "Mr Mbatha, we've been told by Mr Claassen whose representing you, that the reason why you submitted two applications to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it's clear from these two applications that what was said in each of them was, is different.  In the first application, you basically stated that you denied any guilt, any involvement, in the death of the deceased.  And in the second application, the one which you wrote yourself in Zulu, you readily admit participating in the incident which led to the death of the deceased.\n\tThese two applications which were submitted by you to the Commission, were received and each was assigned a different number.  During March of last year, was it March, yes I think it's March, during March of last year, the Committee, none of us present here, two other Committee Members, arrived at a decision and it's quite clear from what is before us that they based their decision on the information contained in the first application submitted by yourself, that is application numbr 4175, the application which we have been told you say you were assisted by some other fellow prisoner in filling in, and which was filled in in English which you admit or say that you don't know too well.  The fact of the matter is that a decision has been made relating to the incident which is under consideration at this hearing now.  And once a decision has been made, whether that decision is correct or incorrect, if it's a final decision, and this is a final, was a final decision, the Committee itself cannot reverse that decision, because we do not have the power to do so, the authority to do so.  \n\tSo that decision must stand until such time that it is set aside, and the setting aside of that decision can only take place in the High Court.  That Court would have the power and authority to do so, and it will of course only do so if it is satisfied that it warrants setting aside.  If we were to proceed with your application today on the second application that you submitted, namely the Zulu one, and arrived at a decision different to the decision already arrived at, we would be left with the absurd situation of having two decisions on the same matter.  One refusing amnesty and another one granting amnesty, and that just cannot happen.  \n\tSo we are basically prohibited at this stage from proceeding with your matter for that reason.  Your only recourse if you were to take further steps would be to have the previous decision set aside.  \n\tIn the circumstances the only course to be followed is to have your application at this stage struck off the roll, or removed from the roll, let's put it that way.  That means that your application, your second application, the one that you completed in Zulu, will still be with the Truth Commission, and if the standing decision is set aside, if it is, then we will set the matter down for hearing at a later stage.  So it's not the end of the matter, but it might be if the previous decision is not set aside.  So your matter is removed from the roll.\t\t\t\t\nMATTER OF NORMAN MBATHA: AM NO 4175/96 - REMOVED FROM ROLL",

And I would say that I was known quite well by the youth in the township.  I got off the vehicle and went to a group of people to enquire as to what was happening, and they fully explained to me that they were trying to stop the IFP from burying their Umhlembwe, and I said to them are they, are you referreing to the Khumalo funeral and they said that's indeed so, and I enquired as to why they were stopping this because this person was a resident of the township, and they said no her husband is involved in the killing of people in the township.  And I said, look this is bad, because this person has to be buried today.  Would you like it if you are not given a chance to bury your own, and that didn't help.\n\tAnd then I went back to the car and told my brother-in-law that look it's bad, we would have to go back, and inform the indunas.  I must say that my brother-in-law was the one who was older than myself and therefore had the authority to communicate to indunas.  We then thought that it would be better to inform the indunas and the police, but then my brother-in-law suggested that we would not able to readily get indunas, and he suggested that we speak to the police.  And them we went to Myame where we found Mr Wessel and other police.  I then went to Wessel because my brother-in-law could not communicate with him in English.  I spoke to him and told him that we have come across a situation, and to avoid the spilling of blood we would have to try another route between the two streets, Khumalo and Ngaki.  Indeed Mr Wessel promised us that there would be no conflict, he would try to bring in soldiers as well as the police, or the stability unit, and he said that we were no longer going to use the designated route, which was Khumalo Street.  \n\tWe thanked him and we drove back, and on our way along a place called Madlala, and I said to my brother-in-law maybe you should go to the funerals to monitor the situation, and as I was talking to him it occurred to me that we experienced a similar problem in 1991, and I felt bad about  that, and I then said to my brother-in-law look I am not going to do what I wanted to do earlier on, I will rather attend the funeral instead.  And he said to me, listen, you will drive my car, it's parked over there and there are people inside.  I will take your vehicle and use it, because I will not go to the funeral.  And I said to him, that being the case, it's okay, and I wanted to know from him who were in the car, and he said there are certain men whom you don't know, and he said it's okay, I'll meet you in church.  And the funeral procession proceeded through Khumalo Street.  I trusted that everything was okay because the police and the soldiers were present.  We would not experience what we experienced before.  And we proceeded.\n\tI was in front of the vehicle that was carrying the corpse, and next to me was a United Nations vehicle that was being driven by a white person.  We proceededwith no problem.  I only anticipated a problem when we reached shops at Ngaki.  I've just forgotten the name of the street, that is where we found people standing on either side of the road carrying stones.  We drove past these people and there were no bad remarks coming from these people, but then I had a feeling that something might happen, but as we proceeded on nothing happened until we reached a spot where we were attacked for the first time.  \n\tAnd when we crossed the street the funeral was, the funeral procession was continuing with Amabuto following from behind, and it's one white man who stopped me and he said, \"...Please stop because it looks like some people have been shot from behind.\"  And I asked him as to whether these people were within my group, and he said yes, one is injured.  \n\tAnd we were ordered to sit down to pay respect and we indeed sat down to pay respect, and I parked my car on the side of the road.  And later on they said we can continue.  We then proceeded on.  I was also in front and we came across a certain Mokoena Street, if I'm not mistaken, near a stadium, that's where I met a group of Amabuto who had come from Qwesini and Boiafuti, and I hoped that they had no problem with the route that they took.  We then went on, but I must say that this one United Nations guy was always next to me as we were travelling, and I was always with the people in this vehicle.  \n\tWe went on and I must say that I came across a certain place where I really experienced problems.   The road was barricaded and there was no exit or escape route, and I said to these men please let us get off the vehicle to remove the barricade, and they said no, we might be shot.  And I said to them if that will happen, let it be, we have to bury this person.  Yes, these men were brave enough to agree with me, and they got off the vehicle, and this one white guy was also brave enough to assist us in removing the stones and all the barricade.  And as we were removing the stones one white guy who was quite hefty, in the company of a black guy who were coming from the township.  One of them was wearing a brown overall, and this white man was wearing a jean and a shirt, I cannot remember the colour of the shirt of course, and he said, he passed very disturbing remarks.  It was very difficult, I did not talk back, but I realised that things were now bad and these men were saying today is the final day, and that on its own told me or suggested to me that things were bad.  Because one could realise that a fight could break out at any time.  \tAnd there had come also this taxi vehicle, or taxi squad patrol vehicle, and unfortunately there were soldiers who were on either side of the road, walking parallel with the funeral procession.  The soldiers are the ones who tried to solve the problem, and at the same time Mafulela Mlaba came along, coming from the opposite direction and he stopped at the road and he said that my brother-in-law wanted to see me, he wanted me to bring back the vehicle, and I said to him I will come.  I just said to him, brother I will come, it's okay, and I said to him I wanted to see what was happening because at the same time we were trying to remove the barricade from the road.  Four to five minutes must have elapsed and Mr Mlaba came back again, and this time he reprimanded me saying that my brother wanted the vehicle, and I asked him where my own vehicle was, and he said he didn't know, and at that very same time I told these other men to come along.\n\tI left the funeral and rushed to where I was being called.  It was not quite a distance from where we were, but then one could not see the place from a distance because one had to go through a bend, and as I drove past the bend I could see the three vehicles that were parked there, one of which was facing Polla Park, and there was also these police vehicle on the spot.\"",

As soon as they said we should rush, I took it upon myself that we should do just as they have instructed because we had to run away and get out of the sight of the police, because as soon as the police will approach they will definitely arrest.

It seems he was unfortunately a victim of circumstances.  He was merely a driver in the incident, and had no intention of furthering the aims and objectives of the IFP.  One of the requirements of the granting of amnesty in terms of Section 20(b) is that the act, ommission or offence to which the application relates is an act associated with a political objective committed in the course of the conflict of the past, and it is my submission that Mr Xaba did not do this by political motivations.
