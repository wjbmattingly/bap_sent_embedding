<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sit please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">J P NEL:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> The applicant's application Mr Chairperson appears on page 152 and 171 and 214 to 233. May I continue Mr Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	Mr Nel together with your co-applicants you were charged in the High Court on various charges of murder, etc and you were then found guilty of charges related to what is known to this Committee as the pipe bombs Western area, Randfontein and Pretoria.    As well as attempted murder, damaging of property and the possession of explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And that is why you ask for amnesty in front of this honourable Committee. And you were also convicted to 21 years of prison sentence. Mr Nel in your application on page 160 it would be your page 2 paragraph 4 there is a typing error, the second sentence of paragraph 4 the word AWB must be deleted and it must be said ANC. It is very clear what is said there. It is line 2, ANC must be AWB. Just a moment please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>	Mr Nel I refer to page 167 paragraph 23 at the game farm there where you were gathered together the Saturday evening the 23rd of April 1994 are you aware or not that Generals who gathered there at that game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson after we returned from the vehicle mission everybody went to sleep and in the evening the Generals arrived there and had a meeting and I was placed as a guard at the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who were these Generals? Can you please name them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> It was General Andries Terreblanche, General Etsabeth, General Nico Prinsloo, General Dirk Ackerman, his brother also Mr Ackerman and then it was Brigadier Leon van der Merwe as well as General Cruywagen and General Smit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after this meeting that evening did they leave there or do you know what happened to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> They held their meeting in the room where Nico Prinsloo and van der Merwe stayed in the camp. And when they finished they got into the vehicles and left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Sunday evening the 24th of April 1994 you received instructions to create certain explosions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What was the target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Commandant Johan du Plessis told me directly that the target was a taxi rank in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The following day did you then go to Pretoria together with Piet Steyn and Gert Fourie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> The Monday I left I was the driver of my vehicle and Piet Steyn sat behind and Gert on the passenger's seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Your target was in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Mr Nel when you left for Pretoria did you get to a taxi rank or what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I know Pretoria well. I drove in. I directly drove to the taxi rank in Bloed Street and van der Walt Street. When we arrived there I identified it but there were too many police in that area. I drove past and did not plant the bomb there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you place the bomb later at a different place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That evening we left again and went to go and look at the taxi rank again. The policing was still strong there and from there we drove, I wanted to go and look in Pretoria North at the station there is another taxi rank. I was on my way there when I saw this area in Bloed Street and thought that it would have the same effect and we detonated the bomb on the side on the pavement of the building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why didn't you detonate the bomb at a taxi rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Because we believed that it would have the same effect if it was planted at a taxi rank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was there any policing there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No there were no policing at that stage but there were black people who moved around there. And that is the reason why I placed it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Nel do you confirm that the application that appears before this honourable Committee as it is in the record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes that it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Mr Nel today as you sit there how do you feel about the occurrences that happened in terms of lives that were lost, injuries and damage to property?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairperson I feel bad about it. I am unhappy about it. If I could I would like to ask the people personally or apologise to them personally. I would like to talk to them and by doing that also state my side of this whole matter and explain why I did it and to tell them that I am sorry that I did it. And that they were in the wrong circumstances at the wrong time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Nel are you presently still a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR KRIEL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson. Just a few aspects. If you look at paragraph 22 of your application page 166.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>MR KRIEL:  	"The men went to a game farm in Magaliesberg where our instruction was to provide security for the farmers in that area."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> In other words that was the main purpose why you went to the game farm or were you sent there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Mr Chairperson in my call-up instructions the day when I was called-up Major Johan Smit told me directly that today we going to fight the war. We must establish our Volkstaat and that we must move up and then we will receive further instructions in Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And in Ventersdorp you were given the instructions to go to the game farm for security and protection of the farmers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> There Brigadier Leon van der Merwe at the Trim Park  once again said to us. First we went to Clifton Barnard's farm and the day when we left to the game farm Major Smit once again came to me and said we going to Magaliesberg now to the game farm. I did not know where it was. I drove with other people there. And there he said to us that we will be on the borders of the Volkstaat close to the PWV area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> But your words and that is the point that I want to make is that the instruction was the protection of farmers in the area. And this aspect runs right through all the applications and that is the protection and security of the farmers in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> During that time we would still have looked after the people in that area. We did go on patrols where we did look after the farmers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> That is exactly the point that I would like to make. Can I just take you back for a moment. The group that went to Bophuthatswana or was sent there in order to secure Bophuthatswana when did this happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I do not carry any knowledge of that. I was not involved in that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you not see on television people who were killed there or shot there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I did see that people were killed there and shot there but I carry no knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> But what I would like to find out when was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> If I get my dates right I think it was in March or February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> When you went to the West Rand, to this Volkstaat area am I correct if I accept that you then forgot about Natal and the Free State and that is why you gathered in the Western Transvaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson for me my instruction was we are going to move up. The Volkstaat area - if I can just go back there was a meeting in February where we did security. It was a closed meeting where Mr Ackerman indicated on a map that we would use the Western Transvaal and implement that as a "Volkstaat." And that is why we went up to the Western Transvaal. When the Volkstaat then became a bit smaller we forgot about Natal and the Free State. We just want a part of the Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And here is an election that is going to take place. Did you see this election as a threat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> That is exactly the point that I would like to make. That is why you gathered in the Western Transvaal and you specifically were called together to protect that area as well as to protect the farmers who lived in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairperson we were a large number of people who were called up for the protection of the Western Transvaal. I do not know where the people gathered but according to my knowledge we would go to Ventersdorp and the rest of the people would be called up in the rest of the Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> But the Western Transvaal the AWB divided into parts and groups were sent to protect the certain areas or parts and you were there to do protection in this area close to the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> In that area as well as in areas where the Wen Kommando could not cope with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> That is now my following point. If the Wen Kommando could not be able to handle the situation you at the game farm you are Ystergarde you would then assist them. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Paragraph 23 why did the theft of four by four vehicles, why didn't you succeed in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> We went out that evening. We went to Klerksdorp. Jannie Kruger knew the area. He identified a garage and the people who went in first came back and from there we drove back to the camp. I do not know why it did not take place at the end of the day because they immediately said that we must retreat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> So you used the word things went wrong so you cannot say why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes we did retreat there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> That Sunday evening that was when you were tasked regarding the pipe bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> After you received this task did you remain the evening at the game farm and the next morning you went to Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> You could not continue with the planting of the bomb. You then went to friends where you remained the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> What did you do during that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> The morning we ate and from there we left. I got false number plates at a place and we waited for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> I assume that you were the whole day there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you watch television?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No we did not. There wasn't a television.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you listen to the radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No not at all. We sat in the car and I think at one stage I went to go and sleep as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> So you did not follow the elections or the happenings or whatever? You did not discuss that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> What time did you plant this bomb approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> It was approximately eight 'o clock that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And during that day because I accept that you probably arrived in Pretoria early that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> The whole day did you in any way try and make contact with head office in Ventersdorp to say people there are problems. We cannot execute our order. We are going to be here longer than we thought?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Mr Chairperson because my instruction was that we have to detonate the bomb and I waited for an opportunity to go and detonate it. I did not contact the head office because my direct commander was at the game farm and he gave me instructions there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> But the game farm was in radio contact with the head office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> So if you wanted to inform them that there is a problem you could have done it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I did not know if the radio connection worked at all times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> But you also did not try and find out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> After you ignited the pipe bomb you left to a resort at the Hartebeespoort dam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct yes Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Why did you have time now to go to a resort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> The same people who we stayed at in the flat that day said that they will leave and go there and from Pretoria we drove there and I first went around to go and visit them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> To do what? You are busy with a war if I understand the applicants' testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairperson some of the people they were two blind men and I was quite good friends with them and they asked us that evening. They did not know what we were doing and they said that if we return that evening they asked if we could just go around at their place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And so the whole day you spent with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No they were not there the whole day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> That is the impression that was created. You go and plant your bomb and you socialise at a resort at the Hartebeespoort dam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That was early the morning we arrived there at the flat and we ate there and a while later they left. They gave the flat to me to spend time there. I did not give them any reason I just asked them if we could stay over and they said yes. And I asked for the number plates. After we had received the number plates we waited till it had become dark and then we drove and detonated the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> But at the resort you stayed there till three 'o clock the morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Sir I put it to you that is not a war situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Sir the circumstances in which we were when we went to the resort was for me was something different. I went to go to friends and we visited there. And now suddenly if you leave there in a hurry or do something wrong they would like to know why can't you sit still.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you only talk that evening, no drinks taken, nothing of that sort?  ...[transcriber's own translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> We didn't drink at all no. We sang Boer songs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nel after the operation who did you have to report to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I would have reported back to Commandant du Plessis, the person who gave me the instruction Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are now on operation you go and plant the bomb. It is a war situation and it was controlled from a head office or from a farm. Why didn't you think it good to go straight back and to report back whether you had a success or whether it was a failure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Chairperson after we detonated the bomb I thought of the people whom I said I will go and visit them so I drove there. I cannot explain to you why I didn't go back to head office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you go back - did you go back and report to du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> When I got back at the game farm du Plessis wasn't there. They were already busy with preparations to leave for the shooting range in Rustenburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you ever report back to him that you have planted the bomb and what the consequences of it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> When I got into the hall - when we walked into the hall me and Fourie, this is now after we returned Major Smit shouted very loudly in this hall. Sorry my language his words were: "Where are you now coming from?" And everybody in the hall heard that. It wasn't necessary for me to report back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In a war situation I am not surprised he shouted at you. How did you explain it to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That was his attitude at all times Major Smit's that is. He always gave threats that he is going to shoot you and that you cannot turn back and that you had to complete your instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did you explain? What did you say where did you come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> He knew I was on a mission because he was there when everybody was issued with their missions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is my point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Commandant du Plessis gave the instructions and Major Smit knew where we were. And because we did not return the day we were supposed to return because the bomb was supposed to be detonated that morning and we only returned the next morning. That is why he shouted "Where you now coming from?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what was your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I didn't answer him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you not think that you must explain yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I only explained to him that we had problems. That is all I said we had problems and I didn't say anything else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Your behaviour lead to the fact that you and all the other applicants or let me put it this way that most of the accused in the High Court was arrested. Is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Your behaviour lead to the fact that most of your colleagues were arrested at the shooting range. Because they would never had been there. They would have been at the game farm. But because you stayed away they fled to the shooting range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Their decision making I cannot justify that. I do not know why they took that decision. Afterwards I found out they said that they took the decision to go to the shooting range because we arrived there late.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And because they were scared you were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct. That is what I heard Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And at the shooting range did the men ask A B Fourie can't they rather visit their wives. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And you decided to go back to the Hartebeespoort dam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> No further questions under those circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KRIEL:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> I've got no questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MOTLAUNG</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you.  Mr Nel after your mission you returned to the game farm. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you did not really report back to anybody about what you have done or whether the mission was successful or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Commandant du Plessis who was there and he gave me the instructions was not there so I couldn't report back to him. And Major Smit shouted it out in the hall so I believe at that stage that everybody knew what was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But you were grown-ups. Wasn't it a question of the fact that the major treated you as a teacher would treat</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>pupils? You were a grown man you were a soldier and you had to go and kill people and you realised that you were going to kill people. Is that correct? </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> In a war situation yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Forget the war. You took two pipe bombs and you detonated them in Bloed Street in Pretoria. This was close to a place where people were sitting drinking. Is that not true? And then you return and this man says to you where the hell have you been. And because the fact that you are not around we thought you were arrested and you don't say anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I explained to him that we had a problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> What did you say what was the problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Because we couldn't place the bomb that morning because of the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you explain it to him the way you testifying now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Because he wasn't my commanding officer I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You only said you had a problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And he accepted it like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes he did. And just to put a thing right. It wasn't two bombs it was only one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> In Bloed Street what did you see when you were standing around there? Was there a shop there, was there a building there? Was there some or other structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> We saw the building and there were black people moving around there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And where was this bomb actually planted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> On the side of the road on 7th Street, at the side of the building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> In other words the people inside did not see what was going on outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Not as far as I can imagine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> How many people were inside this building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I cannot say how many were inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Was it your intent to kill all those people in that building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> It was our intention to create a psychosis of fear so that the elections would be stopped because of that and because there were black people around the building we thought that it had the same effect as if we would have placed it at the taxi rank. Because the majority of ANC members according to us were black. And I saw the black people and I placed the bomb there and we thought it would have the same effect as at the taxi rank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nel before we continue. When you signed these documents did you read the documents? Are you happy that they are correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Look at page 169 paragraph 28. That is your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The last two sentences would you please read it.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>MR NEL</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>	"Piet Steyn ignited the pipe bomb's fuse and he threw it out of the vehicle's door and we left immediately."</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is not placed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Well we threw it out. He detonated it. To me it is the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No Mr Nel it doesn't sound right to me and I want to give you an opportunity to explain this. You testified all the time now about how the pipe bomb was planted next to a shop where there were people, black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it was ignited and then you left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It doesn't sound to me as if you lit it in the car and then threw it out of the window.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Chairperson in Bloed Street we moved up in Bloed Street and we turned right into 7th Street and right in front of this building we stopped. Steyn ignited the bomb, he opened the door and threw it out onto the side-walk and from there we went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that all you can explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is how it happened Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The word "planted" was never really used by the witness. My learned colleague, Mr Prior used the word plant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo whether we speak about plant or put down or whatever. It is very different from throwing something out of the window of a car that is what I am saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The witness confirmed to what was said in his application. Mr Prior said to him he planted the bomb and it is very loose terminology the way he puts it in any case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Prinsloo I heard it very clearly that after Mr Prior's question I did put the question that way but then the witness did say the bomb was planted or placed on the side of the pavement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> This would be splitting hairs to say that because in his statement it is quite evident that where the bomb came to be it might have been placed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Whatever can you remember clearly now that the bomb was then thrown out of the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> It is not a question of somebody getting out of the car, walked to the building and there next to the structure there placed the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> It was never your intention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> It was not your intention to create this impression?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No it wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Nel you received instruction from Mr du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> To place this bomb at a taxi rank and that morning you went to Bloed Street where there was a taxi rank. Why didn't you just plant that bomb that morning? Why was it necessary to drive away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Chairperson as I have already said when we arrived there, there was so many police and policing that we decided not to place the bomb there. We didn't want to create further problems and we expected to be arrested or something like that might have happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> That is why you put forged registration plates on your car. You were scared of being arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then you would have liked to use the dark to plant or detonate your bomb rather than in daylight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But weren't there other taxi ranks in Pretoria where black people would use taxis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is why when we left there we made the registration plates and the night we drove I drove in the direction of DF Malan towards Pretoria North the station there because I knew there was a taxi rank there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Why didn't you go back to the same rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> We were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But now you found a drinking spot, Sanny's Cafe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I did testify that we did return. We did go and have a look and the policing was still strong there and we accepted that we could be arrested then. And from there we left and we would have gone to the next taxi rank and at the end of the day this building we identified it and I thought it would have the same effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was your instruction when you left there with the pipe bombs? What was the target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> We were told a taxi rank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who decided to throw the bomb somewhere else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Chairperson we identified that building ourselves after we drove.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who in the car did this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Please repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who in the car made that decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> We decided it together, the three of us who were together in the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that was one of the opportunities where you could have used your own discretion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Because we did not place it that morning at the taxi rank because of the strong presence of the police I thought that if they were at one rank they could also be at another rank. So we went from the one to the other and then we identified the place and we placed the bomb there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How far away from the taxi rank did you throw this bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I would say about three or four kilometres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I do not understand the reason why you did not immediately drive back to the game farm and that you rather went to a resort up until three in the morning where you sang Boer songs or folk songs. Why didn't you immediately go back and report back to your commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I cannot really say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Sir please you are a soldier. You were busy with a war. You go to Hartebeesfontein and you visit there and you sang songs. Did somebody have a guitar there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And you are saying there was no liquor involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Till three 'o clock in the morning you sang and you didn't drink a drop of liquor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you have a braai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Nothing to eat? Anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you drink soda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Not even coffee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Well you surprise me. And you cannot give us a reason why you did it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> The only reason I can give is that, that morning I told you I will go around there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And you felt obligated to go and see these two friends of yours and to go and visit there because you told them you would?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And what about the Ystergarde and your obligations towards the other men at the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> This resort if on the way back to the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you realise that there was a security risk with regards to your mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I do not know what they thought?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So in other words you placed your men in danger. The longer you stayed away the bigger the chance was that you will be arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you realise it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Not at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you ask for permission to go and see your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> We asked if we can go and see the wives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I was together with the group who asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> When was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> It was the 26th, the Tuesday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> When did you go to the game farm? You said in your application on the 14th of April you received the call-instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you leave immediately?</p>

<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Where were you living at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I was staying in Pretoria and my wife and my children - it was just on my child's birthday she refused to go with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So she stayed behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Was this house in your own name or did you rent this house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> We rented the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And your job - where did you work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I worked at Transnet as a train driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you resign?</p>

<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I was on leave till late in April. I was on sick leave because I had my leg in a cast.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So after your leave you would have returned to your job if you could. Was that your intention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Please repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You would have returned to work after your sick leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> If there weren't any call-up instructions yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Why do you think you were going to Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Major Smit contacted me on the 14th of April and he said now it is time for war. It is now the time we must put everything together we are going to Ventersdorp and we are going to protect our Volkstaat and we are going to wage a war about which we have been told in several meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you think the Volkstaat was going to be founded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So if it happened like that would you have stayed there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes I would have stayed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And what about your job?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> We were told that those who went there for the protection of the Volkstaat that we would be part of the protection of the Volkstaat and you would work for the government of the Volkstaat in a police capacity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> What about the Transnet job?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I would have resigned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> If you thought you were going to live in the Volkstaat why did you not resign before you left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> But at that stage I was still on sick leave. I wasn't close to my job. I got call-up instruction and I went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But the instruction was to go and fight a war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And the war did you think it would be at an end at the end of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> With the run-up to all these events you cannot say when a war would stop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Exactly that is my point. So you had enough warnings at the 14th of April you had enough time you could have told your employer look I am resigning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> If there is a war and at the end of the day if everything succeeded then I wondered if there would still be a Transnet station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you think about that on the 14th of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I believed it was war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And what about your wife and children? Would you have left them in Pretoria at the rented house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> She didn't want to go with me at all and I contacted her and if I can call my father he will also testify that I phoned them that they must go and fetch my wife and children because they didn't want to come with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And your leg was in cast? Could you run?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> With the cast?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So did it get better?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> It was in plaster my leg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did it get better? Could you run with this leg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Ja I run races with my leg in plaster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So it didn't bother you? It didn't hold you back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now after this planting of bomb you ask for permission to go and see your wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I was with the group who asked to go and visit the wives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Because we were together in a group there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But the other missions which would have been executed surely this one bomb mission wasn't sufficient?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> It seems to me that the only thing you did there was to go to Pretoria for pipe bomb and there to throw it at a cafe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That was my instruction. I didn't receive any further instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you shoot at some one at the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So you didn't fire a single shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But these other bomb expeditions were there not other bomb expeditions planned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I was not part of the planning. I do not know if there were any further bomb explosion missions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Were there any order groups where you received instructions saying this is the beginning there are going to be, many other are going to follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Chairperson several meetings before hand it was said but when we were at the game farm there wasn't an order group telling us. We didn't receive further instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You stayed in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You go on a mission to Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Things didn't work out very nicely. Why do you go to a resort? Why didn't you go home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Chairperson as far as I know my wife has packed all of her things. The house was empty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I was the morning at my house. It was empty and my wife was angry with me. Because I left her at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is the day of the mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No the 14th of April I already went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you did go to the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes I was there. That was during the day while we waited for the number plates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what you have done if all the furniture was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I would have asked her again to come with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you have stayed there that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> At my wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> My mission wasn't completed yet Chairperson. I wouldn't have stayed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But then you go and visit friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Afterwards I completed my mission I went for a visit and I went back to the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you said these people were blind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes two blind men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Did you try and determine where your wife was at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> At that stage I did not know how to determine that. I did not know how to contact her. I couldn't reach her. I didn't even know where to look for her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But you said that your father could testify to that. Where were they living at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> They were in Watervalboven. I contacted him, I phoned him before I left and I asked him before I left and I asked him to please go and have a look at my wife and children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Mr Nel can you just get the sequence of this right for me please. On the 25th you detonated this pipe bomb in Bloed Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And you only returned to the camp on the 26th, the following day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Now as you understood your objectives, your objectives were to cause as much chaos as possible to ensure that the election would be stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> That election was going to take place on the 27th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And yet you do two strange things. One you spend critical time, that is the evening of the 25th with friends. And then on the 26th the day before this election that you are trying to derail you go off and decide as a group that you want to visit your wives. I don't understand this. I would have thought this time was so critical that you would spend every moment planning and executing missions to derail this thing that was going to happen so soon. Can you explain this to me? Why people were so relaxed and yet the election was going to take place the very next day. What was your mission in that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Chairperson the Committee member asked so many questions I can't remember all of them. Can't she just stipulate one for one what she wants me to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Yes it is just that I am trying to understand what you were thinking of on that day. And I am actually asking you to put it together for me. I will start again. You went out on a mission. It was important to go out on this mission yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You then spent the night of the 25th with friends rather than go straight back to your commander to report back. Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You returned to camp on the 26th, the day before the election yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Now with that in mind my question is your objective was essentially to derail the election of the 27th yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Why would you spend critical time visiting friends, asking to visit your wives when the election was pending? It was going to happen the very next day. I would have thought that your purpose, your goal was so important that all the other things could wait. You had to derail this election by all means and yet you all seemed to have been very relaxed and wanting to visit wives and looking after friends you had made promises to. I am just asking you to explain this to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Chairperson when I returned from my mission I immediately went and on my way back to the game farm I stopped at these people whom I told that morning that I would come and visit them and from there - in reality we didn't really visit there that long because the explosion happened around eight 'o clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But we've heard all of this. The question is why did you waste time in a time right before the elections?  Because, and this is becoming an important question. It is because the election was going to take place the next day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> It was the 26th when we left again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Chairperson I cannot give you an answer. All I know was that some of the people were worried about the wives on the other farm. I cannot say why we did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were one of the people asking whether you can go and visit your wives on the other farm. Where would you have found your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I was not in the group that asked. I did not physically ask. I stood with the group when they asked it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought you asked to leave the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I was together with the group who asked it. I did not personally ask for permission because I couldn't go to my wife directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you leave the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes I did. And that is why I went to the resort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the people who gave you permission to go to your wife was under the impression that you going to your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Chairperson Major Smit knew. He dropped me at the resort. He knew where I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then why did you want to leave the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> It was not as if I wanted to leave but when everybody left I said no I will go with them, because the others were going to Pretoria they dropped me off at the resort with the people that I met or visited the previous evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you just took a holiday from this war? Because you were not worried about the danger of your wife because you did not know where she was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairperson I did not take a holiday from the war. I believed in what was lying ahead and in my principles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you said you took a - it is like you took a break from the war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I would not say that no. After the men drove back to their wives we would have gone just for the day and then returned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You see again your answer suggests to me that the basic purpose for gathering in the Western Transvaal was to protect yourselves, your families, the people you identified with. I put this to Mr Venter, the last witness. These men you left your families at this critical time because I beg your pardon - you left the "wildsplaas" and the "skietbaan" at this critical time because you were going to protect those close and near and dear to you and that in fact is the original purpose for moving up to the Western Transvaal. So the day before all this chaos, all this election fear is supposed to come about you go back to your original purpose for gathering in the Western Transvaal; to protect those you identify with who are close to you. And that is really why people gathered. It wasn't to derail the election. It was to make sure that you as a people were secure until things had settled down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Mr Chairperson my instruction was that it would be war. At various other meetings it was said and my instruction was that we are going to fight in this war. And at the game farm we were told that we will disrupt the elections in order to force them to provide us with a "Volkstaat." We believed that if the elections will take place at the end of the day we will not be able to get a Volkstaat with an ANC majority. That is why we went to go and disrupt the elections and to put so much fear in the people that they will not go and vote. We wanted to force the government to give us a "Volkstaat."</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But again the interpretation could be that you were just acting as spoilers, I will use that word just as an easy word, just as spoilers. You didn't really have a political objective. You had a motivation yes, but no real objective when you embarked on these minor missions. You were just acting as spoilers. As a splinter group somebody else might say. What do you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Mr Chairperson I believed that everything was under the hospice of the AWB and that the Generals in staff were present when I was at the meeting that they held. And because of the fact that General Prinsloo was at all times involved with Brigadier Leon van der Merwe and also at the shooting range afterwards when we left to go there General Ackerman Jr. and General Smit with Nico Prinsloo were also present. And I believed that the AWB is giving the instructions. They are leading us in this process and I believed that the AWB is in charge of everything and they will take it further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You say that your wife did want to come with you. You did not know but you found out during the day you went to your home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why didn't she want to go with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> My wife at that stage was very angry with me because it was my children's' birthday and the ice cream cake was melting at that stage and I said I was leaving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you meet your wife after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> After I was arrested my wife came to visit me with my parents and we did reconcile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you still married?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes we are still married.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just to add to what Advocate Gcabashe's question. It does not seem as if you wanted to protect your own family. You went to go and protect the land to take it and protect it if I look at your statement now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I believed that I will go to protect the Volkstaat and as much as I would like to have my wife and children with me I could not force them over the barrel of a gun to come with me. I believed in the ideology. I believed in what was put to me. I believed in the AWB's objectives and the fact that they wanted to establish a volk and a piece of land for us where we could go there afterwards and if God-willing I could get my wife and children and establish them there with me if they wanted to go with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You see the problem is to understand your evidence is with all these convictions and beliefs that you had and the commitments that you had you go now get a pipe bomb. It takes you more than a day to plant this bomb. You visit till late that night with friends. The next day you go back. You report again or you go back to friends again. How does this fit in that you were not then involved in this war? How does it fit in your commitment to this war that you were rather sort of on holiday away from this war? It is very difficult to understand this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairperson I was involved from the beginning on the 14th of April I went up. I was with the people all the time. And the first opportunity that I got was that the day of the 25th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Maybe we must just then investigate that. You said the 14th of April you were called up. You went immediately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What did you do from the 14th till the 25th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> The 14th of April we were at Ventersdorp at Trim Park  and then we went to Clifton Barnard's farm. There during the days we did guard duty. We protected the leader's wife. We protected the head office and some of the farmers within the direct vicinity of Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The leader, was he at Trim Park  from the 14th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Brigadier Leon van der Merwe was there. The leader was at the head office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you between Trim Park  and head office? You said you protected him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No our base at that stage where we all gathered with the wives from the Trim Park  was Clifton Barnard's farm. And from there after the wives were with us for a stage and then the wives left to Ottosdal. And from Clifton Barnard's farm at various instances we got instructions that we must go to the leader's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Make it simple for us. This we, is all of them who were there. What did you do from the 14th to the 25th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> My instructions there was to protect the leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you constantly with the leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No not all the time. I was at the farm or at the leader. Then I went back to Clifton Barnard's farm, then I went to his house to protect him there and then went back to the farm. Where he went during that period before we went to the game farm I had the task to go with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who gave you the instruction to always go to these different places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Major Smit and Brigadier Leon van der Merwe he was in command there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you accepted that from the 14th of April to the 25th your contribution to the war was the protection of the leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes and the fact that with a previous meeting at the Trim Park  before we were called up we were told, that was in the February month that a fax was found where they would hunt the Ystergarde and would kill us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But no actions were planned or talk about actions from the 14th till you received the pipe bomb instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When did you think would the war start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairperson I thought that from my call-up instructions I thought that we are available. That it could happen any time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You said that your children's birthday, your wife is angry with you, you walk away and all that you had to do was to protect the leader but anybody else could have done it and you do not think about the war. Did you have troubles at home before you left or only after you left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> It was only after I left there. When I left there yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I can understand if you had troubles and you want to get away from your wife but it is difficult for me to understand if you do not want to leave your wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> For me the struggle that we were involved in, the fact that I was called up now is the time I believed that then it was told to me that it is going to happen. So I was ready to be available at any time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you know if your father then went to go and visit your wife and children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I do not know if he went to go and fetch them. At the end of the day when I was arrested I contacted him and then I saw them when they visited me in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You said that you asked him to go and visit them. From the 14th to the 25th you were gone. And immediately after the 14th you asked him to go and visit them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But up to the 25th you do not go to any trouble to go and visit them and then you go and see that the house is empty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I was not at a phone to phone them. We were in the veld or a bush.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> At the leader's house isn't there a telephone or at head office or at Trim Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> At Trim Park we did not have any telephones and there on the farm, in the veld we did not have any telephones. And at the leader's house where we did guard duty and worked I worked outside. We did not work inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you never worried about your wife and children at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I believed that God would protect them and look after them. Or my father, sorry my father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Nel how many people asked to go and visit their families?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I would say approximately 15 people. I cannot say exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I have got no further questions Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo have you got re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you Chairperson. 	Mr Nel initially you were in Western Transvaal and Ventersdorp and then to the game farm. You said that at one stage that at the game farm was centrally positioned close to the PWV area. What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> When they said to us that we are leaving, Major Smit said that we are leaving for the game farm. He said that we are on the border of the Volkstaat that will be established at that it is close to the PWV area. I believed that after the utterances of</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>Constand Viljoen that he said that the AWB would deal with the city areas, urban areas and the Volksfront would then deal with the rural areas and that is why I believed we were involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you personally patrol on the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No I was more involved with the guard duties. I never myself did patrolling. With the car theft I was involved and the rest of the time I did guard duty. And at the game farm itself ensure that nothing went wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You gave evidence that at the different taxi ranks there were a lot of police that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> According to the evidence in front of this honourable Committee there were other explosions at various taxi rank areas in Randfontein and Western area. Did it have any influence? Do you think that is why there were so many police there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes it could have been a factor. That is why we thought, because there is so many police because there has already been explosions that policing could have resulted because they thought that only taxi ranks would be targeted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> One aspect Mr Nel. You mentioned the</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>Generals where you were on guard duty that had a meeting there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Can I just get clarity concerning this. It does not appear in your statement in Annexure A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Mr Chairperson I did not add that in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Did you see that as an important event?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> At that stage I did not think of it when I made my application but I did bring it under the attention of my advocate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> At what stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> It was with consultation.  I did bring it under their attention and that is why they asked me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> What did you read in that meeting? What relevance do you think that meeting had concerning everything that happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> The fact that the Generals in staff were there because for me eighty percent of the Generals in staff who were there I believed that in that meeting certain decisions were made about why we were gathered there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Did you tell that to your advocate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes I believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> It appears to me as if it is a very crucial event and I find it strange that it now for the first time you mentioning it in this hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is how I saw it. That is what happened, because I was placed as a guard outside but in the time when we wrote this I did not think of it either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> When was this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> It was in the evening the people were sleeping and I was outside, a roaming guard. I was moving around and when they moved in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Then this makes it more sinister.  Here the whole Generals in staff appear midnight in secret and you do not make anything of it and that is strange to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> They held the meeting and I cannot say why it was held in the night and what was discussed there but I knew that they were there definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Did you mention it to your fellow soldiers or men, that the Generals in staff were there last night and I wonder what they were talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No not at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Not towards anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No I was on guard duty I saw them I think some of them were awake and would have seen them as well and I did not mention it to anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Nel it is not the place but it is strange. If you could that this sinister event followed it up with anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No I did not do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman there is just one other aspect that I hung on for so long that I forgot about it. If I may with the permission of the panel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>	Mr Nel you say that you were on leave when you went to the resort or Major Smit dropped you off at the resort. How long did you stay there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I was arrested there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That morning yes. That afternoon late I went there and the next morning, the 27th I was arrested there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it correct that General Cruywagen was arrested at the same place you were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes that is correct he was four bungalows from me and he was also arrested there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who threw that bomb out of the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Who threw the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Or swung?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairperson I drove. Gert Fourie was left in front on the passenger's side and Piet Steyn sat at the back on the left hand side. He ignited it and threw it out of the window.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The whole operation you wanted it to be a success, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This pipe bomb when it was thrown out of the car wasn't there a risk that the fuse would go out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairperson I do not have knowledge of explosives and stuff. They said that is how you must use it and I do not know if that could be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did they tell you do you throw it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes they said that you must detonate it. They did not tell us that you must put it down or throw it or anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There where you were arrested how many people who were at the hearing were arrested there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Those were involved in the hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many of the people who belonged to the AWB or were involved with the AWB was arrested there where you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> There was only two of them, me and General Cruywagen and the rest of the people were AWB people.  At the holiday resort the people, the blind people with their wives and families they were all AWB people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The two blind friends were they also AWB people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes their surname is Snyman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you visit there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No before in training camps we would do that at that same resort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But what did you do to keep the children busy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you do to keep the children busy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I do not know, I wasn't there during the day to know what they were doing with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Chairperson I spoke to you in chambers with regards to an ethical problem. The result thereof is that I withdraw as the legal representative of the previous applicant, Mr Nel and my colleague, Mrs van der Walt would then look after the interests of that client as we discussed it with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the position Mrs van der Walt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.  I also discussed this with the client and he is happy to accept me as his representative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There seems to be a situation that has developed where Mr Prinsloo who has represented Mr Nel thus far has been ethically compromised. The details are not too clear but I accept that this is the position and I can't see any objection to him withdrawing from representing Mr Nel. I am pleased that Mrs van der Walt is able to represent him hence forth.</p>
