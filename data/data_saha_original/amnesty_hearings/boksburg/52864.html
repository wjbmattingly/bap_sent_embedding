<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The 14th of September 1998, and the amnesty applications of Etienne Jacobus le Roux and Others proceed.  Representation of all parties are as before.  I understand that the applicants are in a position to proceed with their further evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	Sorry, are you on record?  Sorry Mr Chairman, Mr Van Zyl appears for a victim in the Jan Smuts Airport attack and is present.  May he just place himself on record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZYL:</span> As it pleases you Chairperson, Johan van Zyl on behalf of one of the victims in the Johannesburg International bombing.  The victim's name is Mr Percyville Moshwetsi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  I understand that Mrs Van der Walt, you are leading the first witness.  Who is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Chairperson, this is Mr Johan Smit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Smit, which language would you prefer to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">JOHANNES COENRAAD SMIT:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Thank you Mr   Chairperson.  Mr Smit, were you a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, since the middle of 1991 I joined the AWB in the Wenkommando.  Since 1992 I was a Captain in the Ystergarde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you were also an accused in the case where the applicants appeared or made application for amnesty in front of this Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And that was a case that was held in Johannesburg before Judge Flemming?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you were then found not guilty on all charges?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Your training as a member of the Ystergarde, what did this entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well, my training, after my training my instruction was to train other members of the Wenkommando in order to begin the war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you carry knowledge of an incident that occurred in 1993 at the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can you just in short tell us why you went there and the reason why you went there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage the leader of the AWB, Mr Eugene Terreblanche did not agree with his Generals in Staff with what happened in CODESA at the World Trade Centre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>	We went there in protest and to say that we will not stand for the ANC government and we will fight for our country.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you just explain something to me.  Did I hear you correctly, that the fact that you went to the Centre was because the leader Mr Terreblanche, did not agree with the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I also understand you correctly that what the members thought, did not matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> To an extent it did matter, but it was more - it had to do more with Mr Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can I continue?  Can I just ask you in answer to the question of the Chairperson, the AWB as a whole, at that stage, when you went to the World Trade Centre, how did the AWB and the members feel with regard to the negotiations with the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> They did not agree with that at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did the AWB at all take part in any negotiations up to when you went to the Trade Centre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> At the World Trade Centre, what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At the World Trade Centre, the march was not as peaceful as we all thought.  It was occupied and Terreblanche said that we will not agree with this type of negotiations, that we will make war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That attitude, was that discussed with the members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> With what happened before the World Trade Centre, there were meetings whether public or closed, it was said that we will make war.  That attitude was not taken in at that stage, it was discussed beforehand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was your rank at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage I was a Captain in the Ystergarde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Now the Ystergarde, what section is that in the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is a specialised unit that was used in the training with the rest of the members.  It is shooters, self defence, patrols, any training and that was their task and instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If I understand your evidence correctly, it seems as if the training that you gave, was military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Up to the time when you moved up to the Trade Centre, were there a change after the happenings of that day?  Did this change take place in the AWB, did any change take place in the AWB with their feelings towards the negotiations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Can you just repeat your question please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did a change occur in the AWB or was the Trade Centre, was that a turning point in the viewpoint of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> How?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> In that the previous government, the NP government at that stage did not want to acknowledge or accommodate the right wing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If you talk about accommodate, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was well known that all the right wing parties stood for a Volkstaat, that we wanted our own land and goals and no one wanted to give this to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were there then changes that took place in the training that you had to give after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.  Instructions were given that people must be sharpened in their training, that we must make more preparations for the war that will take place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can you tell me Mr Smit, can you remember, more or less when the incident in the World Trade Centre occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> If I can remember correctly, it was approximately in October.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can you remember how close it was to the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was approximately one year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If I refer you to June 1993, could it have been during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you then provide any training after that day at the Trade Centre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.  Approximately every weekend after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> During that period, was there any inspections held by the Generals in Staff of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct yes.  From time to time the Generals in Staff as well as Terreblanche would travel through the country.  They would meet people at training camps, look at their ammunition, food supplies, etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If you talk about food supplies, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It would be tinned foods, in other words non perishables.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And the weapons and ammunitions, what do you refer to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It would be handguns, shotguns and at some places illegal weapons and explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You also mentioned that there were training in explosives.  Can you maybe just elaborate on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct, although it was not in my area, certain people, old Defence Force members were experts in explosives, who would give people private training in these camps and they were chosen people.  That was for warfare.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can you tell the Honourable Committee, there were evidence led with regard to the Boere Krisis Aksie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Could you just repeat please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said that these people were the chosen people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Just to come back to that point, the people who were chosen there were either chosen by the Commander or the Generals in Staff, they were well known as they said, who would not turn their backs on them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I would take you back now to the Boere Krisis Aksie, can you just tell the Honourable Committee, you now in answer to the question of the Chairperson, said that it would be drawn back to the Generals in Staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>	How did the Generals in Staff and the ranks under them, how did this work?  Could you just explain this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Let us say that the General of the Gauteng area had 100 people under him, and all of them had their Commanders, and if a Commander chose a person to undergo explosive training, this person would be taken apart and he would then report back to the General and say that this and this person received the training in explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You now talk about the General of Gauteng, these Generals, are there different Generals that were deployed in the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, in all the old Provinces there were a General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And these Generals, do they then gather and have meetings and report back, or what is the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.  It would be the normal Generals in Staff meetings where Terreblanche would be as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What is Terreblanche's position with regard to the Generals in Staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> He is automatically the leader of the AWB and has got the last say and approval of all tasks that had to be executed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The Generals in Staff, evidence was led that they had Order Group meetings, can you explain the Generals in Staff, would they come together in an Order Group meeting and if so, what is an Order Group meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.  They gather in an Order Group meeting.   These meetings are closed, it would only be the Generals in Staff and Eugene Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The Boere Krisis Aksie, do you carry knowledge of such an "Aksie"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What is it and where does it fit in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The Boere Krisis Aksie was another right wing organisation, most of the AWB members were part of this organisation and most of the Boere Krisis Aksie members, were members of the AWB, so it was a coordinated action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> There wasn't really a difference.  Everybody stood for the same goals, although some of the members were not AWB or Boere Krisis Aksie members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why, if everything was the same then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I cannot explain that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who would be considered as the leader of the Boere Krisis Aksie, would that also be Eugene Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I do not know who he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> These inspections that you talked about that were held, you said that was on a regular basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What do you mean by that, on a regular basis, can you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Let us say once a month, these people were brought together either for training camps or just for inspections of the equipment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you receive instructions to in the Commando's and the Commando members, get equipment for a purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> For what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That was for warfare.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When did you receive these instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We received the instructions more intensely after June 1993 after the World Trade Centre incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> There was a meeting held in Ventersdorp, the Committee heard about this, it was a meeting that was held at the Trim Park.  Do you carry any knowledge of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that was the 2nd of April 1993, sorry 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Evidence of the applicants conveyed that they were not sure of the date, some said it was in February or March.  Are you sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, I am sure it was the 2nd of April 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This meeting were addressed by various leaders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you tell the Honourable Committee, was this an open meeting or a closed meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The first part of the meeting was open, after that it was closed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If you talk about an open meeting, could the media be present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And the television?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was your impression with regards to this meeting that was held there?  Let us just look at the open meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well, the impression that was created by all the speeches that were held, was that the war is very close.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This meeting, was that opened with prayer and reading?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> By an ordinary member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was done by a Reverend but who was also a member of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And the message that he conveyed to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That was war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Then Eugene Terreblanche ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you talking about a Reverend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A minister?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And Eugene Terreblanche also talked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct, just after Mr Manie Maritz.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Eugene Terreblanche, did he at any stage in that meeting say anything about negotiations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was his message?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We would negotiate across the barrel of a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did he at any meeting before the elections say that he will take part in the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was his attitude right through this period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That he will not vote, that he will disrupt the election completely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> After this meeting, this open meeting, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> After the open meeting, all the people were divided into certain groups, where the Ystergarde also formed its own group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>	In this period all media people and cameras were removed from this area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were you then divided into groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was the reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The reason for this was that the Generals and the Commanders of each group and sections for communication or medical sections, had to sort them out and to see if the equipment were in order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know Chris van der Heever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What rank did he have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> He was a Fighting General in the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was his responsibilities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Chris van der Heever at that stage, was responsible for all the provision of medical equipment and he would have been able to get Ratels from a military base close by in Zeerust.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If I put it to you, was he in charge of the Special Forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did that happen, that he got hold of Ratels?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not at all.  It was withdrawn just before the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you believe him that he would have been able to get hold of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage Chris van der Heever was Commander of the Wits Command.  He had a lot of say in other Defence Force Commands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But what made you think that he was telling the truth and not just trying to show off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> To go back, at various meetings Eugene Terreblanche said the Defence Force is on the side of the right wing and this and this percentage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>	This old Special Forces member had automatic say in the whole process with the right wing and the Defence Force, that they would communicate with each other in order for us to get hold of these equipment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I just make sure, did you say Chris van der Heever was a Combat General in the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> At the same time he was a Commander of the Wits Command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He was actively involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, actively.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you sure about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, I am definitely sure about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can you just elaborate on this aspect that the Defence Force and the Police would help the AWB in their struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>	You said that Terreblanche at various meetings said this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were there other people except for Terreblanche, who also confirmed this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Not that I can think of at this stage, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> At one stage evidence was also led that Constand Viljoen also had certain meetings with the AWB, do you carry any knowledge of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were you present at these meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Only one at the end of 1992, beginning of 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was his attitude with regards to the Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> He supported the idea like Mr Terreblanche and everybody said after that that the Volkstaat would be the only thing that would save us now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> At this stage I would just like to show at this stage a video of events that occurred, and I would like to lead on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I am not going to show the entire video, merely bits thereof.  The video will of course be available to other members of legal teams.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>	Perhaps I should just show the video entirely, and then we can lead the evidence regarding that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">VIDEO FOOTAGE:</span> We ask our Chaplain General to open this meeting for us.  I am going to read a section to you from the Bible, we came to the land which you have sent us to, the land of milk and honey, the land of fruit.  But the people of this country had died, and the cities have been destroyed.  And we saw the children of the Levites, those in the southern land and the amorites in the mountains, and those living by the sea and in Jordan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>	The people were silenced and Moses said, let us withdraw because we can overpower them and take over their land.   But someone else said we cannot withdraw the nation and so the rumours spread through the children of Israel which said the country which we withdrew from, and the people we saw there, are great.  We saw giants there.  Children of the giant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>	Verse 30, let us withdraw and take occupation later, because we can surely overcome them.  It is wonderful for me that the media can have such an effect on people.  That is what the anti-Christian powers want, they want to influence the beliefs of the masses if we look at the press, the radio and the television, which has infiltrated our homes, and the masses have simply taken them up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>	My fellow people, our security does not lay in what the world promises our people, because your and my security lies in the safety of God, of Jesus Christ who died on the cross for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>	We will not be those "bywoners" in South Africa, we will not be influenced by communism.  We do not have to make any apologies for our presence as white Boer Christians here in this southern tip of Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>	God's hand of provision has brought us thus far.  God has given this country to our people by means of two covenants.  God's Word says today that the Lord your God, gave the country to you to earn as your parents and your parents before them, have told you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>	The question is, are we prepared for this or are we getting cold feet?  The people must remember the promise that we will occupy the land.  The moment of glory has come.  We have been chosen to go and investigate the country and to report back.   We have investigated the country, it is a great country with rich cities and its occupants are giants, its cities are fortified.  We look like dwarfs in comparison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>	We cannot occupy this land.  We do not have the proper weapons with which to arm our people.  It is very dangerous and we are walking into trouble with open eyes.  We will be destroyed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>	Let us turn around, we cannot risk it.  Then Joshua reported and said the country which we have investigated is a good and fruitful land, the milk and honey overflows.  Let us withdraw and then occupy, because we can certainly overwhelm it.  That which the Lord will give to us, is good.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>	But as usual, the report of the majority was accepted, and what a sad story.  A tragic story of a nation who had thrown ... (tape ends) ... Piet Retief, that the country had been explored.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>	I want to ask you this, how are you and I in our attitudes, by means of our God given rights to this land?  How do we feel about our call as Afrikaners in this country as those who were chosen to take up this legacy given by God our Father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>	How do we stand towards this country which was given to our people by God.   God's country is there, we must just occupy it, God gave us this country.  We cannot negotiate about this land.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>	I wonder if our people realise the seriousness of this choice.  People who have the enormous responsibility of preserving God's property, that is our responsibility.  That is the responsibility of the Boer volk, to reserve, preserve and develop this country which was given to us by God.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>	Our people have been misled, thousands have died.  That is our exact problem, everything is at our disposal.  The riches and the words of God which are full of promise, this country with its possibilities which God gave to the people by means of a vow, what are we doing with it?	</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>	Do we take it up for ourselves or are we ruining our chances?  That is what Israel did.  They created a land of opportunity, but they lost it because they did not have faith.  Because they did not have faith, because they stood away, stood back from the cities and the giants, because they would rather chose the little that they had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>	Because they stood in opposition to these powers, but thank the Lord, that Joshua and his partners, did not agree with this view.  They saw the Hand of God which would lead them into this country.  It is the Hand of God which made the promise that you will occupy this country.  You and I must remember that we got this country by means of the vow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>	This is the country which our predecessors, our descendants left for us.  We must not fight and argue.  There are many women and children in this country, which was dipped in the blood of war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>	I want to say to you this morning that God has given us this country already.  You and I must occupy and conserve that which God has given us, even though the world says whatever it says.  We must remain thankful that I should never have to report to Mandela or De Klerk.  You and I will answer to God and we must answer to the question what did you do to the property that I gave you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>	What did you go with this country that I entrusted to you?  Did you cultivate it, did you create a legacy out of it for your descendants?  We must tell God today that we will fight for that which is ours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>	Let us fight then.  Let us fight for this country which God has given us and let us fight on the same side.  Let us take each other's hands.  Let us walk the path of faith.  Let our story never be the same as that of Israel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That is Mr Manie Maritz, I will only show the last portion of his speech.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">VIDEO FOOTAGE:</span> I could not believe how many we are, we are enough.  The first thing we must remember is that we are white people, but the most important thing of all is that we believe in God who helped us out of Blood River.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>	I say that I am a descendant, I am a white man, I am a descendant and I am proud to be a white man.  I have nothing against the black man, but he is not my neighbour, he is not a member of my volk, and that is why I say to my people that we should take up each other's hands and the hands of those who must fight with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>	I want to say to you today that the revolution is at hand, let us begin it, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">VIDEO FOOTAGE : EUGENE TERREBLANCHE:</span> When we came to the Fatherland, we came to listen and talk and make a joint decision because Paul Kruger said that in the voice of my volk, I hear the voice of my God.  That is why it is important for us to participate in today's proceedings.  The volk must talk, because therein lies the task of our volk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>	The volk is a faithful volk, which has committed itself to make this country wealthy through cultivation.  We have committed ourselves to this country in God's name and to give it down to our descendants. </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>	The honour and the wealth of victory will always depend on God.  A house will be built in your name and we will tell our children to the furthest generations, that this is what our volk did.  We have always used you in the meetings of our volk, especially with regards to the annexation of Transvaal when the Boers felt the humiliation of the loss of their sovereignty, the volk gathered at Paardekraal and said what can we do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>	The volk packed the stones and spoke to God.  That is when the volk decided that we cannot live in subjection, the volk was not prepared to give in and from there, the first freedom war emanated and twice thereafter the Boers stormed up Majuba mountain and took back the freedom of the volk, which was from the most powerful empire at that time, the British Empire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>	Those who determine the direction, those who are the natural leaders only 5 000 people from the Boer republic, went up Majuba mountain and took part in a battle which was the same as that of Blood River.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>	Militarily speaking we had the best base.  Earlier during the parade it was asked whether or not 80 percent of us sitting here, were in Bophuthatswana.  You know that when you were welcomed and blankets were given to you, this was after Rowan Cronje and I had an agreement with Bophuthatswana and the former Rhodesia that the AWB's presence would be felt there.	</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>	In an operation area while the Bophuthatswana Defence Force was in mutiny, while the Police were all in mutiny, Viljoen's Officer was sent to the AWB in spite of our agreements and he said the AWB must get out.  They are enough to handle the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>	When his body was ripped of the vehicle and the vehicle was shot down, and the convoy was stopped, all six wounded were taken up and taken to a place of safety and this was executed within a barrage of automatic gunfire and the blacks retreated despite the fact that our bullets could not penetrate their armoury.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>	The fire of the Boers who shot through the tiny hole which they could see, and that is how we saved the day.  Our casualties the following morning, was zero.  Not one single AWB member had died, five were wounded and on the other side, according to the SABC, 50 had died and 285 had been wounded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>	Apparently they are still running.  I know of no military set-up and I am a militarist, I did patrol work for a long time, I was on the border of South West Africa where I fought for a year and 14 days.  I am a militarist, it is my interest and I know of no other battle in which ordinary vehicles with handguns and shotgun fire, fought against military vehicles and ammunition, which left no single Boer casualty during that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>	Regarding our friends who were taken out of the convoy, they were occupied by the Bophuthatswana government and shot dead.  There they were murdered in cold blood by the State.  This Honourable Chairperson General, the blood which flowed there, is blood which heralded the beginning of the freedom struggle with the participation of thousands of men and women and children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>	We must now allow that our volk feels alone.  We must support our volk with sincere prayer so that the Comforter of grief and tears can be felt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>	I feel very proud as a leader in front of proud soldiers, men of courage and determination.  There was never any retreat, cowardice or lack of order.  There was always discipline.  I must tell you that I thought many times that I should also have left, but I did not because if I had turned around, there would have been people who said turn around and shoot, because some of our people might have died in that event.  That is why I thank my Corporals.  They led a convoy out of an ambush, which deserves the admiration of the world.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>	I thank my staff, thank you very much.  When I listened to Mr Willem Olivier - indeed we are threatened and people are fighting against us, the powers of Hell are fighting against us.  We must remember that our Christian Creator would never expect anything from us which we cannot manage.  He would never expect of us to become a Jodi Scheckter all of a sudden and becomes the world's best driving champion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>	He wouldn't expect of us to climb into the boxing ring tomorrow.  He would never give you a task which you cannot handle.  He would only show you what to do if it is possible for you to do it.  If you think about the handful of Voortrekkers in the ox wagon who braved the fever and the illness alone, the illness which killed them, if we think about that, it would never have occurred to us that the Boer could win at Majuba and they did, despite all of this they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>	If we think about the Battle of Blood River where we faced an enemy of 30 000, and even then we became famous in battles of the world which we won.  We were made strong by our God.  When it came to fighting against the Zulu's and the Xhosa's, we had to fight against obstacles, we still fight against obstacles such as communism.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>	These are our political enemies.  We must fight against the bombardment of communism from the Eastern countries.  We must sound the trumpet of the volk and announce that we are here today, we must say the country is good, let's take it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>	We will look like locusts in comparison to our enemies, because they are giants, but this view is not entirely of application, because the group which is threatening us is not a group of giants, and we are not like locusts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>	That is why I say that by means of our experiences and our intellectual abilities and our spirit and the spirit of God which runs through your veins, you can never see yourself as a locus then, because of that.  We are the giants then, we are the white giants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>	We were mentioning figures during the last couple of meetings and we have seen that there are thousands of Permanent Defence Force members.  There are 250 000 Commando and active Civil members of which 180 000 at least are right-wingers.  The South African Police of which 80 percent are right-wingers, and if you add on the 180 000 of the Defence Force Commando members who are right-wingers to the South African Police, and the 65 000 AWB members, then we are more than prepared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>	We have the minority of whites, but we have the majority of soldiers among us.  Umkhonto weSizwe which has 28 million people under its representation, only has about 7 000 members, not 15 000 members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>	We have come out of the heart of the volk for the AWB.  Not only are we the right-wingers, but we have suffered humiliation, fraud and other hardships, but we have become the strongest right wing organisation in this country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>	I challenge you then as Officers and as believers that I have stood before audiences and called and begged and scolded until I have gathered 60 000 of you together.  Now fetch them and arrange them in your Commando's because there are very few choices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>	Next month this time, we will have become part of a new State and those three sixes will hover above our fatherland in the air, or will we have our Volkstaat, no matter how big or how small.  We want our own piece of land in which we can protect our 60 000 men, women and children.  These are our options.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>	I have told you that I will never accept an ANC government.  Since then I have never changed my mind, and therefore I cannot say anything else.  I must say it once more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>	I am what you have made of me.  My task is fulfilled in the obtaining of the Volkstaat.  I just want to tell Viljoen and some of the others, that I refuse to place my Generals in command of people whom we cannot trust.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>	With the greatest possible level of co-operation and the Boere Krisis Aksie, the greatest level of co-operation with all our friends, and with the men and women and children who are prepared to take the oath of loyalty.  You will see that there are more than 60 000 of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>	There will be a time when we fill find our final resting place and that will be when we ultimately obtain a much bigger Volkstaat than what Mandela had ever planned for us.  I promise you that when we have won the war, Mandela will ask us for land and then we will decide whether or not we could do away with a centimetre or two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  You have watched the video, is that the meeting which took place at the Trim Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> It appears to have been on the 2nd of April 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That was also your view before the video was shown, that the impression which you were under was that all addresses and speeches given, the prayer and the Bible reading was seen as preparation for warfare?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Can the witness not be led in that fashion?  I am complaining about the leading question that was just put to that witness, it was not a question at all, it was a statement to which he said yes about a critical matter here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Chairperson, I led this evidence before the video and I am simply confirming it with regard to the video.  I don't know what Mr Bracher's contention is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The influence which you were speaking of before we saw the video, is that also part of the influence which we saw during the video?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You have also listened to the speech made by Mr Terreblanche.  Was there at any stage ever said to you, even during closed meetings, that members of the AWB were to participate in the elections or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was never under any circumstances ever said to us that we would participate in the elections, we were simply to disrupt the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You have testified that after the meeting, you were divided into groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> On the video mention was also made of call up instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you ever receive any call up instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> On that specific day, the 2nd of April 1994, it was said to me and to other members that people should prepare themselves, war is just around the corner and that we would receive our call up instructions shortly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of which war are you speaking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Before the elections, Mr Terreblanche and his senior Generals in Staff were all speaking about the war, and by that they meant the disruption of the elections, that an election should not take place, even if we were to use violence to prevent it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the basis of what followed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the only basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Therefore the elections were not to take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Smit, why was it necessary to prevent the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> As Mr Terreblanche said on video, it was our common sentiment that we would never stand beneath an ANC government.  He also said that the majority were on the ANC side and we were the minority of manpower.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Okay, what was the situation with regard to the Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were any discussions ever held with regard to a Volkstaat and what was said to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.  It was never said that we would ever take a small piece of land of the country as a Volkstaat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Terreblanche said on many occasions that even though it was a small piece of land for 60 000 people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, but he said after that, that Mr Mandela would have to come begging for a centimetre or two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From that small piece of land?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, from the entire country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And everybody realised that this would spread throughout the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, it was about the entire country, not just a small piece of land.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This small piece of land upon which the Volkstaat would be established, was the entire South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, the entire South Africa, all four of the old republics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Smit, on the video a map was shown, did you see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was that map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That was a map of the Volkstaat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Which areas did it comprise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Basically the old four republics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> To which four republics are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Natal, Cape, Free State and Transvaal.  The Provinces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> On the video, certain towns were indicated which were situated in Western Transvaal, did you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was the meaning of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage especially the Ystergarde and certain sections of the Wenkommando were sent to protect certain areas in the Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why that area specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Because our Headquarters were in Ventersdorp in the Western Transvaal and before these incidents, before the elections, most of the towns in Western Transvaal, like Ottersdal and Sannieshof were the major AWB strongholds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you know the organisation by the name of WESBOU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> After this particular day, the 2nd of April 1994, did you receive any further call up instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, I did.  Approximately round about the 19th of April 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Yes, and what was said to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I was told that I should get my people together and that we should move up and gather in Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When you speak of your people, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That would be the direct Ystergarde members who fell under my command in that region.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Where did you live at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I lived in Vanderbijlpark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And so therefore you included that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> After that I gathered some of the people, amongst others Jaco Nel.  We met and we drove from Vanderbijl to Pretoria where we gathered and from there Mr Hanibal, Jaco Nel and other people who were involved, collectively moved to Abie Fourie's smallholding near Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This Jaco Nel, he is one of the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Hanibal, what do you know about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Rudi Hanibal received his training from me.  He was also one of the key State witnesses in the hearing in 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You said that your rank then was Major?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Then you went to Mr Abie Fourie who is also an applicant in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was his rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> He was a Commandant in direct command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Very well, and then where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We waited there basically the whole night for his brother Gert, who had to come from Standerton.  They all arrived at Abie Fourie's smallholding and after that we left for Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The call up instructions which you received, what exactly did that entail?  What did you hear and what was conveyed by you to the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Our call up instructions were to collect all our food, all our weapons and all our people together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> It wasn't told to you what you should do after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then at Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We arrived there, we were addressed by Nico Prinsloo, Leon van der Merwe who told us that we were here to make war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Nico Prinsloo, he was the General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.  At that stage he was Secretary General of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And that is the gentleman sitting next to Mr Prinsloo over here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And what did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> After that we were taken to Mr Kloof Barnard's farm where we stayed and prepared ourselves, our provisions and our weapons for the war which was at hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When you speak of us, are you referring only to your group or other people who were there as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No there were other people who were also present, they had come from other parts of the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were there many people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We were approximately 30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> There was evidence that the women were moved to Ottosdal, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.  The women were not happy about living in the bush and we moved them to Mr De Wet's farm in Ottosdal where they resided.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you know anything about whether the Army would have been involved at that stage with this entire operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> According to my knowledge, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know about the Army bases in Zeerust?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What would they have done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The Army base in Zeerust was an old Infantry Base and they would have provided all our armed vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That came directly from the Generals in Staff, among others Gen Chris van der Heever, the Combat General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Okay, the women had been moved to Ottosdal and the men, where did they go then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> After that, the men left for Mr Leon van der Merwe's farm where we began the whole thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This Leon van der Merwe, what was his position in the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage, he was the Head of the Ystergarde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was his relationship, was he quite involved with AWB Headquarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct, he worked for AWB Headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And Gen Prinsloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> He also worked for AWB Headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> There was evidence that this group of people then left for the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you receive any orders at that game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Basically we were told that we should prepare ourselves and our equipment, that we should be ready to make war and that we should be prepared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Nico Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The AWB members would usually take an oath of loyalty, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Could you remember that oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Could you say it to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> If I walk ahead, follow me, if I turn around, shoot me.   So help me God.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What did you understand with this oath when it said if I turn around, shoot me?  What was that to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That would mean if I wanted to retreat as a coward and did not want to fight any longer, that I should be shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This order which you received there from Gen Prinsloo that there would be no turning back, what did you understand by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That we were there for good.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> To do what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> To make war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Is it correct that there were many other people from other regions at that game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, amongst others from Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you know whether apart from the game farm, there were any other places in Transvaal or in the entire region, where there were people who had also come together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.  Koster, at some or other holiday resort approximately 1 000 people had gathered there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That would also be during that same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you know of any other groups who had gathered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, I don't know exactly which places they gathered at, but I know that they gathered throughout the entire country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So therefore not only in the Transvaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not only in the Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What were your duties during this gathering at the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I was in charge of all guards and guarding systems who were supposed to guard the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> These people who had moved along to the game farm, could they move in and out freely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> There had to be special permission before you could leave the game farm.  The reason for that was that we were afraid that any information or planning that we had undertaken, could be leaked out to the Police or other agents of the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Headquarters in Ventersdorp during that period in time, do you know whether Eugene Terreblanche was present there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I wouldn't be able to tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> On the Saturday, that is the Saturday before the elections, you were on the game farm at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did any planning take place on the night before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Among others it was planned to steal 4 x 4 vehicles, the only reason for that was that the terrain upon which we were moving, was not suitable for the usual type of vehicle and we needed other vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was there any communication between the game farm Camp and any other persons outside the camping area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We struggled to establish a communication system and the only other communications which we could establish, would be with Nico Prinsloo who had to drive to AWB Headquarters from the farm all the time, to obtain information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> He was on permanent basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know of any person living at Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Abraham Myburgh who lived on the farm at Koesterfontein.  That is where the explosives were stored.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Smit, your evidence was where you arrived at the game farm, that Sunday, the Sunday before the election, you were also at the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What happened there that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> There was a closed meeting held by myself, Nico Prinsloo, Leon van der Merwe and Abie Fourie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you know Mr Johan du Plessis, also an applicant in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.  He was also present at this meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was discussed at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At this meeting it was basically strategy and the planning of this whole operation that we wanted to execute and we did the final planning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> To what operation are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That would be the so-called warfare.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was decided?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We decided that we would only target black taxi ranks, we will not go into white areas to unstable that areas, in order to disrupt the whole election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How would that have happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That would have happened through bomb plannings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the whole bomb planing process was targeted at black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.  Yes, it was directly targeted towards them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> If you look at the old dispensation, they were the enemy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That was how we believed it to be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No one said that.  Every person felt like that in his heart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the whole attack was based on racism?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But how does it work then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The new government is an ANC government.  The ANC government exists 99 percent out of blacks, so the election had to be disrupted in order for black people not to take over the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I am talking about the enemy and that the black people were the enemy.  That was your belief.  How can it not be racism?  It is based on the colour of a person's skin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> If you want to look at the colour of the skin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, that is what you testified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> If white people would come into this area where we would plant these bombs, he is white, left or right, we are sorry for him.  In no war you find friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>	The people who fight in this war, are your friends.  Nowhere were there racism involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do not understand this.  You said that the bombs were targeted at black people.  There were talk of the protection of white people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>	The bombs must not explode there where white people will be and I accept as far as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said if I understand your evidence, that the rational behind this over the years was that it was the belief that the black people were the enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you said that they were always the enemy.  In this country we know that the colour of a person's skin is the only way, or were the only way to distinguish people from black or white?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is the only way in which you can distinguish white or black people, that is the colour of their skin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that not racism?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not in my eyes.  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is racism then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Any person is a racist.  The definition of that is a person who loves his nation or volk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A person who loves his nation or his volk, then he is a racist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In South Africa in the way in which I understand your evidence, it was the chosen country of the white people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As a result of that, the black people were the enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I understand you correct that under the chosen people, there were not one black person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Which chosen people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Those who were chosen to govern this country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On what basis was this decided?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It is about the Volkstaat.  In parts of the Volkstaat, it would be as in the old dispensation in that black people had to leave the country and go back home, let's say at ten o'clock at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it not true that according to the belief that God gave this country for the chosen people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And under those or amongst those chosen people, there were not black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Continue please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Can I just ask this, from this viewpoint was the Bophuthatswana attack which was known as a black State, how is this reconcilable with the AWB's policy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was targeted at international fame and national fame, firstly for Mr Terreblanche and then for the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> How do you mean targeted for, are you saying that he wanted to make his name known in the attack on Bophuthatswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.  There was another motive and that is to begin this warfare.  Later, we would also have attacked Bophuthatswana, who would we at that stage protected and made this part of the Volkstaat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when this happened, the AWB lost, is that not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Where did they lose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In Bophuthatswana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not according to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Could I just get clarity on one point.  When we watched that video, the snippets we watched, I didn't hear Mr Terreblanche say that black people are your enemy, they have always been your enemy.  The impression I got and the way it was translated was that it is not a racial issue.  Where then do you get the idea that this war, this operation, was about the AWB attacking black people because black people have always been the enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Through the years black people always as in the Heidelberg, or the black people always killed the white children and people, and in that case it was the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> If you were executing an operation that you thought was authorised by your leaders, you seem to be going beyond what your leaders had been saying to you just a few weeks ago about black, white and what the issue really was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>	This is really where my problem is.  Your leaders weren't saying black people were the enemy, therefore we attack them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> They didn't say it at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Yes, but this is what you are saying the rationale was, at this meeting that you held at the game farm and your whole operation was based on this issue of black people are the enemy, therefore we headed for black taxi ranks and never mind that a certain area is a white ANC area, that would not be an issue for you at all, even though you might have known that a particular area is white and strongly ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> As I would have given evidence furthermore, the whole West Rand, Jo'burg of which Johannesburg is the largest liberal area.  That was the target area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>	So if we started at black taxi ranks, there were the largest support base of the ANC was, that was the target area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You said that the discussion was furthermore about explosions or bombings that would take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What bombings were discussed on this particular evening, that is now when you were with Leon van der Merwe, Nico Prinsloo and Du Plessis and Abie Fourie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I am not quite sure which explosions were discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> In the meeting, was there any discussion with regard to pipe-bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct as well as a trailer bomb of which the trailer was the property of Eugene Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Regarding the pipe-bombs, what was discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We discussed that we would build these bombs in Koesterfontein.  These bombs had to be used in these bomb attacks and we had to use the equipment we had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were any instructions then executed after this discussion with regards to the pipe-bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, people were called together.  In groups of two, two or three, three instructions were given to plant these bombs at different places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If you say people were brought together, of which people are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That would be the people that were gathered at this game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> At that stage, the people who were there were then aware of the fact that pipe-bombs would be thrown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know where all these pipe-bombs were going?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who gave the instructions that pipe-bombs had to be thrown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Nico Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Now Nico Prinsloo, his rank was that of a General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When he gave you these instructions, how did you see that?  Did he personally give the instruction, where did this instruction come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> He conveyed this instruction personally, but the instruction that he gave to us was coordinated with his driving to Ventersdorp Headquarters where the Generals in Staff and Eugene Terreblanche were and where they discussed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did he at any stage tell you that it came from the Generals in Staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you say that you are not quite sure where all these pipe-bombs went?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I am not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did missions go out then to different areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You say that there was also discussions with regards to a trailer bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was that at the same time or was this discussed at the same time when you were discussing the pipe-bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Mr Cliff Barnard said I am going to use this trailer of Mr Eugene Terreblanche to build this bomb.  Mr Nico Prinsloo then answered and his words were that he will have to tell the "Oubaas" that his trailer will be used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You knew that these bombs could kill people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you agree with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From the start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You now mentioned Cliff Barnard who spoke there, but you initially testified and you did not mention that he was present.  What is the situation there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I just forgot about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This trailer, can you just elaborate on that.  You said that he said that he will personally go to Terreblanche and tell him.  Of who were you talking when you say he, himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I am speaking about Nico Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did Nico Prinsloo tell this to Barnard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That he will use the AWB's trailer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was there any other discussions concerning the trailer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, they said that the registration plate will be removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know that Sunday morning a bomb exploded in Bree Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know who planted the bomb there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> At what stage, after the bomb exploded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, after it exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who told you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was a closed group of us who stood there and amongst others Jan de Wet, whose vehicle was used in this trailer bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I am talking about the Bree Street bomb in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I am sorry, I am confused now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I am talking about the Bree Street bomb in Johannesburg, did you know who planted the bomb there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> After this discussion took place, what happened to Cliff Barnard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> He and Koper Myburgh and Koekemoer ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just before you continue, I am confused now.  I understand that you said that the discussion was about the pipe-bombs and the trailer bomb.  If I heard you correctly you gave evidence in the line of that the pipe-bombs were built at Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, all the bombs were built at Koesterfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is it true that the pipe-bombs were built there or did it come from another place?  Other evidence was led that it came from another place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The final product was at Koesterfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you see this yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why are you so sure about this, that is what I would like to know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well, Koper Myburgh, Cliff Barnard and this Koekemoer, they lived at Koesterfontein during that period when we were at the game farm.  They brought all the stuff from there to the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But Mr Smit, you were at that meeting that evening and the first time bombs were discussed then in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct, and that is when they brought the bombs there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, but you are talking now about them being at Koesterfontein.  What knowledge did you have about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is what they told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So they told you that they built the bombs at Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they arrive there at the meeting with the bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not with the bombs, no not at the meeting, but after the meeting took place, the people left the hall, all the people.  They gathered on the verandah of the hall where the workings of the bombs were explained to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You said that you had regular contact, I think you talked about driving to and fro from Ventersdorp and the farm and you had contact with Mr Terreblanche and Gen Prinsloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But with all this driving to and fro, when you heard about the bombs that were built and which would be used, and when they talked about the trailer, then he said he will have to go and tell Terreblanche that they will use the trailer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well, I do not know if Terreblanche's trailer was taken without his permission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you knew that he was in contact with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you did not ask him then, you did not ask him why did you build a bomb in Terreblanche's trailer without talking to him while you go there every single day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Nico Prinsloo never built bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Smit, the evidence that you gave here, is that within your knowledge and memory?  It is really difficult to follow you on this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I can just testify about things that were told to me, other things I cannot testify about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That is my problem.  You testify about things that were said to you, but that does not make sense within the framework of your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>	Are you sure that it was then said to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I find it very difficult to follow you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can I just get clarity for you.  The person who was in contact with Headquarters, who was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That was Nico Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> During that meeting where this trailer was discussed, who had to go and tell Terreblanche that his trailer will be used for a bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Nico Prinsloo would go back to tell Terreblanche that Cliff Barnard took his trailer to plant a bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> According to what you understood there, it was that Prinsloo knew that Barnard took this trailer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct because Barnard in this meeting said I went to get the "Oubaas's" trailer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So he did not carry any knowledge of that before that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You said that the people were gathered outside and there was a demonstration held, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.  I was not present there throughout the whole demonstration, I was in charge of the guards and I had other tasks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who presented the demonstration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was Koper Myburgh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What did this entail, this demonstration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> What I could hear and see was how long it would burn, how it is ignited and that is basically that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> In other words, it is the workings of this pipe-bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you said that the missions then went out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That was the Monday just before the elections?  That is the evidence that is in front of the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You then moved from the game farm to another destination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We went to the shooting range just outside of Rustenburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was there any other discussions held at this shooting range outside of Rustenburg with regard to any explosions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> There were quite a few meetings, discussions about people who wanted to go back to their families, to go and greet them, and as well as the planning of which I was not part of, of the Johannesburg, Jan Smuts bombing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You said that the people went home to go and greet people, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Initially people thought that this would be a very short thing, but after all these explosions and bombings Gen Ackerman amongst others said at the game farm, that the bombs were looking good, we are on full steam, we continue and this would be a long term thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This was the beginning of this was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you have hopes that you would win this war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> With how many people in the military wing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> What military wing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Those who would help the AWB to win this war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage there were 1 200 people at Koster as I testified earlier on.  Countrywide people were gathered, I cannot say that there were 20 000 or 50 000 people, I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would it only be AWB members who would be part of this war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No Sir, as I testified earlier on the Defence Force, Police, Commando's they would provide us with vehicles and men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The contact in the vehicles was Gen Viljoen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I don't know who the contact was.  I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you know then that the military people of South Africa would assist the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Like you saw on the video, they gave us numbers and before the election they said that so many Policemen and so many Defence Force men will support us, and we went on that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The reason why I am asking this is on that same video, there was apparently problems between Terreblanche and Viljoen, that was on the 2nd of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How is it then that you thought that the AWB can receive support from Viljoen is there is problems between the leadership?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We would not have supported Viljoen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he not in charge or at the Head of the Military wing of the Security aspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You did not have any knowledge that he was the General of the Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, I knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> At that stage, when Mr Terreblanche and Viljoen had problems, what was Viljoen's position then with regards to the Defence Force, was he still in the Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage, as far as my knowledge goes, he was not a member of the Defence Force any more.  He had his own right wing movement and that was the Volksfront.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I understand you correctly then that according to you, Viljoen would not have anything to do with the war of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> In the beginning or in the beginning of the planning, he was involved until he decided to vote.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But when did you then discover that he is going to vote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was just before April 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it not a few days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was just before the bombs went off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The bombings occurred around the 27th, 28th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I haven't got the exact dates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And we are talking now about the 2nd of April.  You see, evidence was led earlier on that indicated that the support of Viljoen and the Defence Force carried a lot of weight, and some of the evidence was that they did not know that when bombs were planted, that Viljoen indeed pulled out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But on this video apparently on the 2nd of April already, there were problems between the two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I cannot testify about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you think, you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage it did not even come up that there were problems between Viljoen and Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you thought that the AWB would still receive support from Viljoen or the Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I did not think of Viljoen at all, but I still thought that we would receive support from the Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did you think that would happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well, like Chris van der Heever said of the vehicles that we would get at Zeerust, military weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And men?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, we did have the men.  Terreblanche said we had 60 000 men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's say 100 000 men, did you think that 100 000 men would win a war in this country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I would win it with 5 000.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you believe that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I just follow up here, why do you believe that with 5 000 men you would win it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage I did believe it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You believed it then?  Can I just follow the following up, you said that the men went to go and greet their wives for the last time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage like I also testified, it was within a time span of 24 hours from when we left the game farm and the afternoon when the men left to go home where Gen Ackerman said that we cannot turn back, things are looking good, we now continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>	So we went to go and greet them and then continue with this war for a month or a year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You see, you initially thought that it would be very short and the evidence that we received from all the applicants was that they accepted that it would be a long period because they sold all their assets, they brought their families with them.  The women were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And that they would build up a community there to start the Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.  Every person had his own view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you testified that it would be a short period of time and then everybody would go home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct, everybody had his own opinion.  I left all my things at home and I would have gone to fetch it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Don't you want to talk just for yourself then, you said we and our group.  Every time you talk on behalf of the group.  If you have an opinion, please make it clear that you are busy with your own opinion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, I will do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you carry any knowledge that people left their homes and left their work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why did they do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Like I said everybody has his own opinion.  They thought it would be a long thing, I thought it would be a short thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You further mention that at the shooting range, there was a further discussion with regards to explosions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What did you hear there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I heard that the last bomb must go to Jan Smuts airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who gave this instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Nico Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you hear why it had to go to Jan Smuts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, it was for international publicity, in order to stop or prevent any international investments and communism was supported by foreign countries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who was present when this discussion took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was myself, Abie Fourie, Johan van der Merwe, Nico Prinsloo and Johan du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about the white people that would have been killed in that bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Like I said earlier on, in war there is no innocent people.   There are no innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you then remain or stay behind at the shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I also went back to my home.  I then went to my parents' home in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This Gen Ackerman that you are talking about, what is his position in the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I am not quite sure, all that I know is that he was part of the Generals in Staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Evidence was led that there were two Ackermans.  Of which Ackerman are you talking about, the one who was at the shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was Dirk Ackerman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That was at the shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, it was at the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were there any other Generals who visited the game farm, except for Ackerman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> With him was Alec Cruywagen and then a third person whom I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When did they visit this game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> You now mentioned a meeting where the pipe-bombs were discussed.  Was this before or after?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was after, it was the morning of the 26th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That was the morning before you left for the shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Statements were made to some of the applicants that the people who acted there at the game farm and at the shooting range, was a splinter group or the people at Koesterfontein.  What is your comment on this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, it was not a splinter group.  All the groups from Koster and the shooting range and countrywide, we were a combined group in instructions from the Generals in Staff and Eugene Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you know if there were any other explosions, except for those in Johannesburg and in ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.  The Boere Krisis Aksie just before the election, they took responsibility for certain bombings at power lines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you know if it was done by the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not before we started working at the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I just take you back to a previous question.  You now again said that the people were gathered all over the country by the Generals in Staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But before you were asked about that, you said that you did not know.  Can I just ask you, is it not true that the evidence of the applicants were that they came from the Free State and some from Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, there were people from Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, but also from the Free State, if I am not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I cannot say who came from which town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> My question is if people came from Natal to Ventersdorp, what would make you think that there would be gatherings in Natal as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That was the information that we received?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> From whom?  Why would the people from Natal then go to Ventersdorp, why won't they gather there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It wasn't a thousand people, it was a small handful of people.  I didn't say thousands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I asked you why do people from Natal come, if there is a gathering in Natal in any case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I do not know what the situation is there, I cannot give evidence about why he came to the Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> My question is directed at something else.  My question is actually what is the grounds on which you say that there were gatherings countrywide?   The applicants said that according to their knowledge and perceptions, there were other gatherings within the Volkstaat area, but you are certain about the fact that there were gatherings all across the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>	You first talk about the four republics, and the Cape was included and everywhere there were people gathering.  Where would the war then start or begin?  The evidence and you were at the Trim Park, is that we will start from a small place and we will then continue and later Mandela will then come and beg for a piece of land.  How are you so sure that they gathered all across the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That was the information that I received and that is as simple as that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> From where did you receive this information, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, it was either at a public meeting or closed meeting, talk was that people would gather all across the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Didn't they say that people will gather from all over the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I don't know if there is a difference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What does gather mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It means to come together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You come together at  a certain point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I think the most suitable word would be points.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How do you know that this was the planning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is the information that I received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you had other information to the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is possible, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You said that some of the other Generals were present as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> There was Ackerman, Cruywagen and a third person that was not known to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did they have a meeting there or what was the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> They basically, I wasn't in a meeting where they were present, but the previous evening they arrived, they slept there.  I cannot testify about meetings that were held.  The next morning they said the bombs looked good, continue.  We continue with the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You were then arrested, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, the morning of the 27th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did the Jan Smuts then explode?</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage I did not carry any knowledge of that and while detained, I heard about this.  They said look what you have done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can you just tell the Honourable Committee how it happened that you testifies in front of this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Out of my own free will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you approach anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Only you as a legal representative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS VAN DER WALT:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where do we start, Mr Van Zyl, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Mr Smit, there is something that I didn't quite understand regarding the way you are going to wage your war.  Is it your evidence that the bombs were actually targeted only at the black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Did you ask me whether the bombs were aimed solely at the black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I would say that over the entire Rand area the greatest target was soft targets such as taxi ranks and so forth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Yes, I understand that you call some of these things soft targets, but the main import of my question is were all the bombs  ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Motlaung, I can tell you that he did give evidence to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Now, you say that according to you, this was not racism?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> And tell me, if this amounted to racism in your view, would you have gone on with the war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage in my heart I believed and felt that it was right, that we should wage the war and that we would maintain that which we had built up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That who built up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That which the whites had built up in their existence in this country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> And you say that according to you, no innocent people were to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I didn't say that.  I said that one would never find innocence in any war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Now tell me, the people at who the bombs were directed, the taxi ranks amongst others, were they not the innocent people in your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I have just said that there were no innocent people.  Take note, no innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Maybe I don't understand the answer, what is the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I said that in no war would there be innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> That I understand that some innocent people can be caught in the crossfire, but what I am asking is these people at the taxi rank, the ones that you actually aimed to kill or maim, were they not innocent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Let us just get away from this idea of innocent people, there were no innocent people.  The aim was to kill and injure people, to do anything to disrupt the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a>	In other words there are no people ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why weren't the voting places not blown up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The objective was to disrupt the election, it was not to take place and that is why everything had to happen before the 27th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If that was the target and if the plan was to prevent the elections, why then didn't you blow up the ballot boxes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The 27th of April ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Instead of putting people's lives at risk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Whether we blew up the ballot boxes or not, people would still have died.  The major objective was that these actions were to take place before the 27th of April, not on the 27th of April and not after the 27th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.  So the bombs which were planted on the 25th were correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct, before the 27th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, that is why I am asking why weren't the ballot boxes blown up before the 27th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Because they would have found another place to place the ballot boxes and hold the election.  The idea was to disrupt the election entirely so that it would not take place, so that people would not go to the ballot boxes on the 27th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So bomb explosions would take place at the taxi ranks and that would have prevented the elections from taking place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is what we hoped for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Motlaung?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Mr Smit, as far as the bombs are concerned, did you have any role to play yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> I've got no further questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOTLAUNG</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bracher?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRACHER:</span> Mr Smit, what are your full names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Johannes Coenraad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did you tell the story you have told this morning, to the Criminal Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I did not testify in the Criminal court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did you plead not guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Were you represented by Counsel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Have you applied for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> As I understand the evidence, you were aware of the Jan Smuts bomb and the Boksburg bomb and the pipe-bombs before they occurred, and you were part of the organising structure in the meeting, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Are you prepared to accept personal liability for the injury and damages and death that were caused there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I have no desire to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Do you accept personal responsibility, I don't care whether you have got the facilities or means or not?  If I issue a summons against you, will you consent to judgement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Chairperson, I would just like to place it on record that the very same Mr Bracher with regard to the previous amnesty applications, also issued a similar threat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a>	I would like to put it to the Committee that this was quite a problem for the applicants.  The applicants are here and it is the Committee's duty with regard to the Constitution and the Law, the applicants are here to present the truth to you, they are also here to present evidence before you so that you, the Honourable Chair and the rest of the Committee, can construct the bridge which is mentioned in the Constitution among the divided community which existed and the future which lies ahead of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a>	How can it be expected in this country that reconciliation be achieved, if these applicants arrive here with the greatest will in the world and they try to present evidence which would support their applications, if they are forced to do so under duress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is wrong with the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> It is a threat Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why do you see it as a threat, it is a simple question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> To ask this applicant whether or not he would accept accountability for a civil claim, if that is not a threat Mr Chairperson, then I don't know any more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am not sure whether it was a threat, I don't know if it was intended as a threat, because this witness is not an applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> He is not an applicant, but he is being threatened with that, with a civil claim, and the same thing happened on a previous occasion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I really wouldn't be able to say if this is a threat, it was simply a question with regard to whether or not he would accept accountability.  Yes, Mr Bracher?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> As the Chair pleases.  I just want you to understand that what you are doing today is confessing to a crime, and confessing to a civil wrong which makes you personally responsible.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At this point, I would just like to intervene, with respect, that Mr Bracher was aware of the fact that this man was an accused before Judge Flemming.  He is aware of what the allegations were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a>I don't know where he is coming from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think Mr Prinsloo that he can clear this up with regard to this civil case which he is mentioning.  Quite honestly, I don't understand what the problem is with the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect, I don't understand what the relevance is of the civil claim if any such evidence cannot be used, any evidence which is given here, cannot be used in a civil claim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Allow him to answer the question, then I will tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Do you understand my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I prefer not to give evidence any further regarding this matter.  I did understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you not want to answer the questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I will answer the question but if I am going to be sued because of this, I wish to say nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Is Nico Prinsloo here today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Do you know if he is going to give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Can you point him out to me please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> He is sitting right next to Mr Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Mr Smit, what did you do in the war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> In which field?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Anything, tell me something you did to fight this war?  This great war to get your homeland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well, to begin with I trained people before the elections.  I was part of a group of the group who was at the game farm and those who were going to distribute the bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The trailer bomb group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I had knowledge thereof but I did not execute anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did you consider yourself to be part of the trailer bomb group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Do you consider yourself to be part of the Boksburg bomb group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>

<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Approximately 15.</p>

<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> In the first place it is rather a ridiculous question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bracher, he hasn't testified that they stayed at home because they didn't want to fight the war.</p>

<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.  It was a paramilitary civil organisation, nothing to do with the government or the army.  Yes, we maintained discipline.</p>

<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Now you had ranks in the AWB, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct, it was para-military civil organisation, nothing to do with the government or the army.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did you have discipline, army discipline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, we maintained discipline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> How many chains of command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It depends in which division of the AWB or Ystergarde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Ystergardes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> From the Colonel, who was Leon van der Merwe at that stage, right through to Lieutenant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did you have a chain of command?  I mean a junior officer wouldn't argue with a senior officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Some of the witnesses spoke about "Christelike norme en standaarde", did you use those in your army?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did you apply the Geneva Convention to your war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I don't know exactly what is contained within the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> One of the things the Geneva Convention doesn't permit is the targeting of civilian targets only.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well that is a foreign idea.  In my mind there were no innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Tell me, who trained in the use of explosives, who did the training in the use of explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I can't remember the name at this stage.  There was training in various areas by various people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You don't know of anybody who did such training, that you can name today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, Chris van der Heever is one of the persons who provided explosives training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Is that the Brigadier you're talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And who - do you know of anybody who was trained in the use of explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Among others, Chris van der Heever, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> No, who received training, anybody that you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Now I want to go back to these meetings where the targets were chose.  Who gave instructions about what targets were chosen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Nico Prinsloo gave those instructions via top structure and Eugene Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> No, don't worry about what you heard about.  Who did you hear giving instructions about the choosing of targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Repeat the question please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Who did you personally hear giving instructions about the choice of targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Nico Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Anybody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And what exactly did he say the target should be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It's very difficult to say exactly what he said but he said soft targets, preferably taxi ranks and bus stops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Who did he gave those instructions to?  Who did you hear him give those instructions to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> In these closed meetings mention was made of names which I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Is that the only time you heard him give the instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Just give me a chance.  After that on the stoep the rest of the group gathered and Koper Myburgh demonstrated the bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Who spoke at that meeting?  Koper Myburgh?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Koper Myburgh gave the demonstration of the bomb there, Nico Prinsloo gave the targets.  He didn't say: "Go and blow Boksburg taxi rank, he said: "Go and blow up a place in Boksburg", whether it was a taxi rank, a station or a bus stop it didn't matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did he mention Boksburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I just take it as an example.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did he not mention Boksburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Not that I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did he mention specific ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who would have decided then that Boksburg, the taxi rank in Boksburg would have been a target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who would have decided on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Decided on what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That the taxi rank in Boksburg should be a target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I assuming the generals and staff, those who would have attended the planning phase of this entire operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The is question is aimed at trying to determine who would have told those who planted the bombs to place a bomb at the taxi rank in Boksburg specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> If that order had to be given it would have been given by Nico Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You didn't hear that instruction being given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Not at all, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> To this day you don't know who was responsible for the Bree Street bomb in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Just tell me exactly what you know about the Boksburg bomb and when you first heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I would just like for Mr Bracher to indicate, the Boksburg bomb, to which incident exactly are you referring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Sorry, it's Germiston bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I don't have all my facts together regarding which bomb was planted where and whether it was a trailer bomb or a pipe bomb, so if you could just give me a bit more clarity regarding that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>

<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I would just like to ask, if it's a pipe bomb then it would have been on that evening that the pipe bombs left the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The trailer bomb, what do you know about the trailer bomb?  Where did that go off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Germiston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Now when did you first hear about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I heard about that when volunteers were asked to go and plant the bomb, and Jan de Wet and he said that he would use his own vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Now when did that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I'm not entirely sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Well you remember hearing him, where did you hear him, what meeting or what place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was on the game farm.  I'm not certain but it could have been on the evening that the pipe bombs left the farm.  That is when the volunteers had been requested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Is this in the public meeting on the stoep, the open meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The whole thing began with Barnard in the closed meeting and then led to the open meeting on the stoep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> So they would have asked for volunteers at the meeting on the stoep and Jan de Wet stepped forward, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct, just as all the volunteers of the pipe bombs were asked there as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> I'm talking about the trailer bomb, don't get the "pyp bomme" mixed up with this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct, all the volunteers were asked that evening on that stoep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> But we know Mr Vlok wasn't there, he was involved in one of the bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I can't testify regarding who was there and who wasn't there at that stage.  I know of certain people who were there ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Who called for volunteers??</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Nico Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You say Nico Prinsloo went out and addressed the gathering and said: "I want volunteers for a trailer bomb", and Jan de Wet stepped forward?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I never said that he wanted volunteers for a trailer bomb attack, he addressed the meeting on the stoep and asked for volunteers to throw bombs.  They were looking for a vehicle which could draw a trailer for the trailer bomb and Jan de Wet was someone who had a vehicle that had a towbar on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> I don't understand your evidence.  Was a trailer bomb mentioned in this gathering on the stoep?  Did they ask for volunteers?  Otherwise, where did it take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> All that I can say is that the volunteers, according to my knowledge, for all bomb attacks were requested on the stoep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Yes, but you say: "So ver dit my kennis strek", did you hear it happening, did you see Jan de Wet volunteer, did you see Prinsloo ask him to, asking for trailer bomb volunteers or was not of that actually seen and heard by you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Okay, I was inside the hall and we were still busy with radio communications, the establishment thereof.  I heard everything which happened.  I just heard that de Wet said that he would be driving his own car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did you hear somebody asking him to volunteer for a trailer bomb and who was it and where was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was pertinently put to him, they said: "We're looking for a volunteer who will draw a trailer for us".  Jan said that he would be prepared as long as he could use his own vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Is that your evidence?  All you heard was a volunteer to tow a trailer and Jan de Wet said: "I will tow a trailer"?  Is that your entire of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct because it was about the trailer, and previously we were talking about the "oubaas".</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The Commission will decide that.  Now go to the Jan Smuts bomb, tell me exactly what you heard, who said what to whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I cannot testify regarding who said what.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Well you did already give evidence this morning, so tell me what your evidence is because the trailer has got into nothing, now what about the Jan Smuts bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was just said by Nico Prinsloo that we should plant a bomb at Jan Smuts airport in order to elicit international reaction and also to stop international investment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Prinsloo said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> When did he say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> He said that in the afternoon just before we went home, during the meeting when we were talking about the Jan Smuts incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The closed meeting, the open meeting or neither?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was during a "geslote vergadering" meeting at the shooting range just outside Rustenberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Now who was at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was me, Abie Fourie, Nico Prinsloo, Leon van der Merwe and du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Smit, before we proceed or adjourn, were you involved in any decision to plant a bomb, wherever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I did not tell anybody to plant a bomb because the way I understand it ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understood your evidence you were a trainer amongst the Ystergarde, what did you teach them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well explosives was not part of my field, I dealt with self-defence and weapons.  I also provided sharp-shooter training but in no way explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you weren't an expert in the field of pipe bombs, so what were you doing there, why were you called in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> In the same way that everybody else was called up I was called up as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the way that I understand it, you had absolutely nothing to do with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well many did nothing in many people's eyes but I was part of the group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you say you did nothing, you know nothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, that is not what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand your evidence you can't say who made decisions, you can only say that Mr Prinsloo gave the orders from time to time.  You cannot say how people were chosen to plan certain bombs, am I right so far?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> As I have testified, volunteers were requested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you don't know who asked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Nico Prinsloo did the asking but I don't know who volunteered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you say that you were part of a meeting during which the strategy was planned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.  And what I mean by "strategy" is what we were going to do, were we going to plant pipe bombs, trailer bombs, that kind of thing ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Under strategy yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But not where it would be planted and who would plant it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was not part of strategy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well where it would be planted would be decided on a level much higher than mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So that meeting couldn't really have taken very long if the only decision to be made was whether or not you'd be planting pipe bombs or trailer bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not long at all, we were speaking of a couple of minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we take the adjournment now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a>	There's just one question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Mr Smit, just as a follow-up question to that, what was your contribution in that strategic planning forum, what contribution did you make to the discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> As I have already testified, the strategy which I have mentioned had to do with equipment.  That is what I mean by "strategy", the type of equipment that we would use.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">JOHANNES SMIT:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Could you please just inform us a little more with regard to your answer, what exactly do you mean by strategy, what exact strategy was discussed during the meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> All that I can say is that it was the strategy that was used.  We had the minimum at our disposal.  Our strategy would be, right, we have to plant a bomb, what type of bomb, how we're going to plant it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But if I understand your evidence correctly, when you had that so-called strategy meeting, the pipe were already there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.  The first meeting was held and during that meeting we decided what we would do and we would plan that.  During that meeting we were told that bombs were already being manufactured at Koesterfontein.  We  left meeting, went into the second meeting and that is where Koper Myburgh and Cliff Barnard and Koekemoer were told: "There are the pipe bomb".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was the second meeting the open meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So they walked in between the closed and the open meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, basically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were the pipe bombs not demonstrated during the first closed meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, only during the second open meeting.  That is all that I know of.  In the closed meeting we spoke about the trailer bomb but a pipe was never in that room during that meeting.  When we went to the second meeting the pipe bombs were retrieved from the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When it was said that a trailer bomb was being manufactured at Koesterfontein, this was said to you during the closed meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But then the strategy would have been determined a long time ago?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> What I understand under strategy is what took place during that meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But I still want to know what the strategy is, because you've been told that a bomb is being built in a trailer, it's Mr Terreblanche's trailer, we must go and tell the old boy, and you've been told that pipe bombs are being manufactured, these pipe bombs are supposed to be thrown but you're not informed where they should be thrown.  This is while you are busy with radio communication and then you hear people being asked to volunteer for these activities, what kind of strategies are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I can only once again reiterate what I was involved with and that was: "What are we going to use and how are we going to use it".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you already knew that you had it, that it was being manufactured, the decision had been taken.  You were told that a trailer bomb was being manufactured. It wasn't as if you sat there not knowing what you had, you were told what was being done, you were confronted with a strategy, according to your evidence.  You were not part of the planning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well then strategy planning is probably the incorrect term.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> What do you understand under the word strategy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Planning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I ask you two questions?  The video which was displayed to us, where did you find this?  Did you make this available to Mrs van der Walt?  Did you have any knowledge of this video?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And in your background, what is your career or your profession, were you in the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I was national member of the army.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What else have you done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I work for a private company.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In which field?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Finances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bracher, I was hoping to take tonight's plan home but I've changed my flight to half past twelve tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Mr Smit, you told us that at the meeting where it was announced that there was a bomb being built at Koesterfontein, Mr Abie Fourie and Mr du Plessis were present, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> That's Mr Johan du Plessis, one of the applicants in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> I want to put it to you that neither of them said anything about that in their evidence.  And if the Commission should believe you and find that they have not made a full disclosure of all relevant facts, they may not be entitled to amnesty.  Do you nonetheless persist in saying that it was said at a meeting at which they were present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I cannot testify about somebody else's testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Do you persist in saying it was said at a meeting at which they were present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> As far as I can remember, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Excuse me, "so ver soos u kan onthou"? Is there some doubt as to whether it was said at meeting at which they were present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I'm not saying that I doubt it, I'm saying that as far as I can remember they were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> What does that mean, do you mean you remember it happening there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Like I said, as far as I can remember they were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you mean: as far as you can remember?  Either you remember if they were there or you do not remember they were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I remember they were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And the meeting at which a bomb in Jan Smuts was discussed, Mr Abie Fourie was there as well you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And Mr du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And if Mr Prinsloo carried out his intention, Mr Terreblanche must have known there were bombs being built, trailer bombs being built as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct, Mr Terreblanche would have known about all of these bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> How do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Because this was direct instructions, as we received it directly from him and the generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You got it direct from Mr Prinsloo, you didn't get direct from Mr Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Mr Prinsloo was a member of the generals in staff, the generals in staff's instructions and execution of it is approved by Mr Terreblanche directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Well I'll leave it at that, you don't know that.  I just want to ask you about the Volkstaat, have you got in front of you these volumes?  There's a bound volume called: "Index, Volume 1" and if you have, please turn to page 95.  We're looking at the evidence of Mr Vlok, Johannes Abraham Vlok.  Similar evidence was given by the other applicants.  Can you just read aloud paragraph 21 please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a>MR SMIT</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a>"The instruction was given that we must move to the Western Transvaal where the future Volkstaat would be established and that all members must leave their work and houses to go to the Western Transvaal in order to protect the Volkstaat.  If they do not follow the demands of the Afrikaner Boerevolk, the election will not take place"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And just turn over the page and read the introductory part of, the first sentence of 24.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a>MR SMIT</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a>"We as members of the AWB believed that the Western Transvaal will become the future Volkstaat and that we must protect and get hold of this at all costs.  At that stage the AWB already received the freedom of 21 Western Transvaal towns"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You see, the evidence was here that the Volkstaat was going to be in the Western Transvaal, and when I listened to that video I didn't hear anyone speak about: "die hele land", did you hear those words being used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The whole country was not mentioned no, but what does mean but that Mandela would come and beg for a centimetre of land.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Can you explain why some of the applicants would sell property in Pretoria if that was going to be part of the Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The beginning of the Volkstaat would have been the Western Transvaal, so somewhere we needed a beginning.  That is all that I can testify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> But were your instructions not to "bekom en beskerm" the Western Transvaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At the beginning, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> I also didn't hear on the video anything about "ontwrigting van die verkiesing".  That wasn't said in any of the extracts, was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I cannot comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Well you listened to it when I listened to it, did you hear anybody say that the instructions given at that meeting were to "ontwrig die verkiesing"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bracher, to be quite fair, there were insinuations at least that the forthcoming elections were not acceptable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now while there may not have been as forthright an allegation that there must be an attack on the elections, one can read in the circumstances, an attack, when they say they didn't find it acceptable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> I won't pursue it Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>	You said that at these meetings you were in charge of "toerusting", what did you actually do, what did you supply or obtain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Which meetings are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Meetings at which bombs were discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That would be at the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Is that now on the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I never got hold of any equipment, it was already obtained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The other evidence that we had here was that there was an operational radio on the farm which was in touch with the head office of the AWB, which would not make it necessary for Mr Prinsloo to drive backwards and forwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> As I also testified, at the meeting on the verandah of the game farm, the same distance as we are from each other, I was still busy struggling to make connection with the head office and we could not do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The other evidence is wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> What evidence?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, we couldn't make connection or communicate with head office, that is why it was only Nico Prinsloo who drove to and fro.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I arrived at head office when we got there and I wasn't there again.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a>	Sir, you say that the purpose to get back to the - the purpose was to disrupt the elections and you believed that these bombings would further that aim, would disrupt the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Now on the tape we hear Mr Terreblanche saying that: "Next month this time we will have a new government", did you hear that on the video tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Would you agree with me that it seems as though Mr Terreblanche himself was of the view that within a month from the 2nd of April there would be a new government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That is not put in the context properly.  It was very clear that Terreblanche said that there are only two choices.  I did make a note of it.  He said that there are only two choices, either there will be a new government with the flag of the 666 or we will be a Volkstaat.  It was a choice between these two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do not believe that that's what the attorney asked, she's not talking about options.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Then I think, with respect, it must be put clearer because I do not follow to what she is referring.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But your client or witness said that he does have knowledge of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I do carry knowledge of what was said on the video but I agree with my legal representative that there were two options.  It was not said that within a month we will have a new government.   We had two options, either a Volkstaat or under a new government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Smit, I don't know if I have it correct but as I remember it he said: "If we do not do certain things we will have a new government next month".  Is that not right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And my opinion he talked about warfare.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that what you are talking about?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Answer the question then please.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was suggesting certain processes.  As I understood it, in the context of making war.  And he said if those things did not occur then by next month they would have had a new government.</p>

<blockquote class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a>"Early next month we will have a "eenheid" state or a Volkstaat in South Africa and I said that I will never accept an ANC government and I will not change on this"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a>I think that was the context.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, I'll leave it at that then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a>	Sir, then when you were being led you again referred to the evidence that General Constand Viljoen would have, the impression was that General Constand Viljoen supported this idea of the military option.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Just for your comment Sir, Mr Viljoen's submission to the TRC - and I take this Mr Chair, from a submission dated the 19th of August 1996 at pages 25 and 26, where Mr Viljoen also talks or General Viljoen talks that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a>"We realised that the mood amongst some of our supporting groups was volatile and that one action is that it could very well become uncontrollable.  The demonstration at Kempton Park and the operation at Mmbatha showed that"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a>And then it goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a>"We were at the cross-roads.  In the end we saw little sense in more violence and we wanted reconciliation and that is when the agreement came to the constitutional principle of the Volkstaat and this all this happens in March, Sir, 1994, a month before the bombings took place"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a>Do you accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I cannot comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Did you have knowledge of that in March 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> According to my knowledge in March 1994 he would have supported us fully.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Was he not then participating in the elections Sir, General Viljoen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Not as far as I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But Mr Smit, did you not see in the streets his posters and placards?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I never saw his posters or placards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Sir, I won't debate it to you but any South African who was driving through any town or village at that time would have known that General Viljoen was participating but you are the exception to that, is that - I put that to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Cambanis, he can't be the only exception, there were other applicants who claimed the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>	You together with certain applicants did not see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Sir, when we were watching the video material we heard a preacher or a priest giving what appeared to be a sermon, you heard that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And what was the purport ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The preacher called it a sermon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Was the purport of that, would you agree, that this Volkstaat is a mission from God, God's mission?  God had spoken and said the Volkstaat should come, is that fair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> What would you say, what was the purport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The content of that sermon was to protect and to hold onto that which is already ours, that was the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To who did it belong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The people who live here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Everybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> If you look at the history, the white people built this country the way it is today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I didn't ask this, I asked to whom the country belonged at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> To the inhabitants of this country, the National Party Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Not according to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who gave this country to the Nationalists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> They worked for it.  The National Party was in power for a number of years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> According to you, to whom does the land belong now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The ANC Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Smit, but your evidence was that the National Party was part of the enemy, and all the applicants' evidence was the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct because they gave the land away ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, they gave the land away, but they kept the land while the AWB and the National Party, on your evidence, did not sit on the same side.  The National Party did not represent the Afrikaner, as the AWB thought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now why then, if it was the National Party's country, how did the AWB then God's command keep or hold onto the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Let me put it differently.  The country belonged to the whites.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So if it was white communists it would have been alright?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Sir, in summary, God's mission that it should go to white, it belonged to white Christians who spoke Afrikaans, that is who the land belongs to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I cannot testify about God's mission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did you think you can execute the word of God?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> In what circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Like that minister said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That minister pertinently pointed out from the bible that we have to fight what is ours and we have to hold onto it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How would you then have executed this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> By war, by disrupting the elections in order for it not to take place and to ensure that the land would stay in the hands of the whites.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who would have done that, in the name of God?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The right-wing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that as the advocate or attorney described, as white Christian people who spoke Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I'd like to move away from people who spoke Afrikaans, the AWB didn't only have Afrikaans speaking people but white Christian people.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a>	Sir, but part of the constitution of the AWB talks about white Christianity, white racial purity being one of the objectives of the AWB, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And part of the motivation is based on your religious belief, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was mentioned during meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> By whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> By Eugene Terreblanche amongst others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you believe everything that Mr Terreblanche said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> At that stage yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Did you know whether any of the members present at Koesterfontein or at the game farm were currently at that time members of the police force, South African Police at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> There was a set of twin brothers by the name of Coetzee.  I'm not sure if they were twins, I know that they were involved with the permanent forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Sorry, that means they were active members of the South African Police at that time. And what was their role in the planning, the execution of these bombings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> They didn't have any definitive role, they were there as the other members were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And as the other members, they knew about the planning of these bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct, after the meeting on the stoep of the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Now Sir, did you know anything about any contact between any of these groupings and sections of the police at the time, April '94?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Which contact do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Well, would the Coetzee "tweeling", would they have been there in their, in what capacity would they have been there at the farm?  As police people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, both of them were trained by me in the Ystergarde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Now Sir, the Bree Street bomb for example, was just a couple of days before the election.  At that time there was very tight police security in and around the main centres, do you agree with that?  Do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Is there any reason why the plans went ahead with no fear of detection, roadblocks or so on by the police, that you can tell this Committee?  If you know.  If you don't know it's ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We knew about the risk but the work had to be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you very much Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS CAMBANIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LANDMAN:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a>	Mr Smit, why did Nico Prinsloo want the 4 x 4's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Firstly, when we were on the game farm there were many dirt roads, it was a very difficult terrain to move over in normal vehicles and that is why we needed the 4 x 4 vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> No that's in the "eerste plek", were there any other reasons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Was there any intention of building bombs in these 4 x 4 vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> How far was the game farm the AWB headquarters, in kilometres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I'm not certain how far it was, approximately 50 to 80 kilometres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> And how long does it take to drive there, to Ventersdorp from the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> And how many times did Mr Prinsloo, that Sunday, the Sunday that you were on the game farm, how often did he make that trip?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I can't answer that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> More than once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I doubt it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Do you think it was only once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It could be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> When he came back from that trip did he tell you where he had been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Not to me personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did he tell you as a group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Not that I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did anybody ask him where he had been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Not that I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did he tell you what his instructions were from the AWB headquarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did he go into town alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> There was one occasion, I can't remember on which day, that he and General van der Merwe went together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Was that on the Sunday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did Nico Prinsloo ever admit that he knew anything about the Bree Street bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Not to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Thank you, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LANDMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR KRIEL:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, there's just one or two matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a>	Mr Smit, as I understand you were part of the leadership on the game farm, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, I was in control of the guards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And when Prinsloo arrived there and the meeting was held behind closed doors, you were part of that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's the correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And that was the first time that you heard that you were to plant bombs or set bombs off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> So as part of leadership, you heard for the first time on Sunday evening the 24th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> At that stage did Nico Prinsloo tell you anything about the Bree Street bomb which had taken place earlier that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Would you agree with me that Mr Terreblanche, on the video which we watched, clearly indicated what the AWB had done in the past, that is what they had done, that's how many people, they'd attacked this, they'd done that, but during the meeting, the closed meeting of Sunday evening absolutely no mention was made of the Bree Street bombing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Not that I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> However you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> You said that you resided in Vereeniging, Vanderbijlpark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> That was part of the old area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> How long did you live there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Four years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> So therefore you knew the PWV area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> You knew where Commissioner Street was in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.  I know about the street but I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly where it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Commissioner Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Therefore you wouldn't know where Bree Street is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I know about the street but I don't know how to get there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Where is Bree Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It's behind the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And you knew that at the time of those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Very well.  Koesterfontein, did you know on that Sunday evening who was based at Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> I mean the persons who were at Koesterfontein on Sunday evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well I knew that Koper Myburgh lived there, it was his farm.  I knew that Cliff Barnard was with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> And the so-called Koekemoer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Only those three?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That I knew of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KRIEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV PRIOR:</span> Chairperson, just one or two aspects.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a>	Mr Smit, do you know Fred Rundle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Apparently during the criminal proceedings he testified in order to mitigate his sentence, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Not when I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Didn't take any further interest after your conviction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Sir, I also have a job to see to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Just answer the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I wasn't involved in it any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> According to a newspaper report of 2nd April 1996, on page 12 of Annexure A, for these proceedings, Mr Rundle was called as a witness and according to the report under oath he said that the AWB never gave instructions to members to plant bombs in order to disrupt the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> As far as I know I cannot testify according to his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is that surprising to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> That on he on behalf of the applicants, during the criminal proceedings, that he testified this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well it is surprising to me now.  I think that he would have incriminated himself in a number of matters if he had admitted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Even before the trial on April 26, 1994 in Business Day, on behalf of the AWB, Rundle also denied that the bomb explosions could be ascribed to the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I can't give evidence regarding that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is it your evidence that Mr Prinsloo had direct instructions for the AWB to plant these bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> From Mr Eugene Terreblanche and the fellow generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> As I understand the issue Rundle would have liaised with Terreblanche, he couldn't simply make utterances.  He would have been briefed or told what to announce to the world.  He couldn't personally make any kind of announcement, he would be speaking on behalf of the AWB, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct, but I could also ask other people to lie on my behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> One final aspect.  The preparations for the manufacturing of the bombs and the transportation of the bombs, is it your evidence that for the first time, regarding you, you came to hear of it, on the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And you were the person who would have asked: "How are we going to build the bomb and what is our equipment?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I didn't ask that, I was present when we discussed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> For the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> For the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you know that they were going to use Mr Terreblanche's trailer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, I heard about that for the first time in the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And a grass roller which was on the farm purely by coincidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I have no knowledge of a grass roller.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> What contribution did the Natalers have in the whole affair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> They were members of the rest of the group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Why were the proceedings at Koesterfontein so secretive, or kept secret from the other people on the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well my honest opinion is that any military action which was to follow should be kept secret until a certain stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And the statements made by the AWB which appear on page 13 of Annexure A, that according to Mr Rundle once again, this was on the 22nd of April 1994, and I quote</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a>"We are not planning to act aggressively, however if our people are attacked, the attackers will get to do with the entire power of the AWB.  Furthermore, no we are not going to disrupt the elections.   What should we do to achieve this, physically prevent people from reaching the ballot boxes?  We're not going to do that because we are not kaffirs"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I cannot testify regarding his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is it not true that this small group at Koesterfontein had their own agenda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's not true, that had absolutely nothing to do with the agenda of the AWB, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It would appear as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> But that's your opinion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Abie Fourie said that regarding him it was more patrolling and the protection of farms and farmers and so forth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That was the initial call-up instruction to get people there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> When did it change?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> On the game farm during the closed meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> On the Sunday evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well I talk - probably the Sunday evening, when it was said that we would disrupt the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And according to you Mr Prinsloo has to assume the entire responsibility for that decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> He gave the direct order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Without that you would have continued with the ordinary patrolling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS VAN DER WALT</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Smit, were you present here during the previous session of this hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Can you tell at which stage you went home from the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The afternoon of the 26th of April 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And when were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> In Pretoria.  I went to my parent's house, not to my own house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Why did you go there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I didn't have any further interests there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Didn't you think that the war should continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I felt that it would be continued on the morning of the 27th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And where did you think you would be on that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We would go back to the shooting range outside Rustenberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Can I just get this right, you were arrested in Pretoria, where were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> One other question.  As part of the strategic planning group or that group of leaders, how did you plan to co-ordinate your effort with the efforts of the people at Koesterfontein for instance, and the other "punte" that you knew to be operational points?  You know, where others had gathered to do what you were supposed to be doing.  How were you going to co-ordinate your activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That would have been co-ordinated by means of radio communication.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> But your radio didn't work, you have told us that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that's what I just said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> So how would you know that one of the other groups had not targeted, for instance Johannesburg Airport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Personally I wouldn't have known that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> But you were part of the general planning around the bombing?  I just use that as one example.  I'm just visualising this, your group could be arriving to bomb Bree Street, any particular place, Germiston, another group could be arriving to do exactly the same thing, you have no radio contact with head office, how would you avoid chaos in your own ranks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> As far as I know our order was to do with the Rand, the North Western East Rand, so the other groups and the other members and the other leaders had their own orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> And just to get this absolutely right, at no stage did Terreblanche come and visit you, either at Koesterfontein, at the game farm or at the shooting range, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> And would I be correct to say again that you certainly, the last time you saw Mr Terreblanche where he was giving you instructions as to where you were from as a people and where you were going to as a people, was on the 2nd of April at that gathering at Trim Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Just help right, so when did you see him, between the 2nd of April and the 24th of April, when did you see him and what was he saying to you in particular?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> He didn't say anything specifically to me, but I did see him after we had moved up to Ventersdorp when we were protecting headquarters and staying on Cliff Barnard's farm.  So therefore I did see him but I didn't speak to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Now again just explain that to me because, just give me a date, just to help me understand and picture this, a date and what he would have been saying to the people whom you may have been with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Let me give you a background.  Approximately, I'm not sure about the dates, but let's say the 19th of April we were called up, we went to Ventersdorp and we then went to Cliff Barnard's farm and our orders were to protect the AWB headquarters.  We didn't speak to anybody else in an open meeting where there were other people.  Some of us may have spoken to members while we were guarding the AWB headquarters, but personally I can't offer you any evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> So as far as you are concerned, the changed of policy or the change of function, to that of disrupting the elections, came from Nico Prinsloo on the Sunday evening, before that all you were told to do was guard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Smit, did you believe the church minister?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I think all of us believed at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is: "all of us"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Any person who listened to a sermon in a church service or during a meeting believed what the minister had said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tell me, is this the first time today that you have come to speak the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you make any attempt to get to those people who had lost their husbands or their wives or their children as a result of what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That is why I am here today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, the question is whether you made the attempt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> When I went to the legal representatives out of my own free will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you go and speak to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> With any of the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, with those who were injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you were to have such an opportunity would you make use of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Even though these people may be black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is your attitude today towards the Boere Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was never realised and it will never be realised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well was that not one of the hopes that you cherished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you still a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What would happen if they came tomorrow and said: "Let's take up arms again and fight the war"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> There would be no way in which I would.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what if that minister gave another sermon in church?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I wouldn't believe in it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what is your attitude towards black people today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We all live together in the same country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we know that, but what is your attitude?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We are all citizens of the country, you do your bit and I'll do mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can't we all live together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well we all live together in the same country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, as a nation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> We are not the same nation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Aren't we the South African nation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So then why can't we all live together as a nation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Because we are not a nation, we are all inhabitants of one country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Don't you see that there might be an opportunity for all of us to live together as one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> As I've said, we will never be able to be one nation but we can all live together in one country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Don't you even want to try to live together as one nation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Even some of the applicants said that they would be prepared to try to live together as one nation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> The only way to have one nation is to rid the nation of hybrids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I'm not going to debate the scientific aspect behind that.  You see, we are all here in order to determine the truth behind certain problems and the notion, or to achieve the notion of one nation and that is why I will once again ask you, and I'm not speaking of science here, are you not prepared to at least make an attempt to contribute to the achievement of one nation in the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well we have been under the government of this one nation for four years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Might I just follow up on this point please.  According to my historical background, terms might be used differently and incorrectly.  As I understand you, do you still see the Afrikaner as a volk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, as you have the Zulu nation or the Xhosa nation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> As a homogenous ethnic volk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What do understand under nation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> One nation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You understand it similarly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well then if I were to say to you, let us assume that the definition of one nation denotes all those living within the same country's borders, under the same lay, in the same political arena, all of those who commit themselves to the same constitution and the same legislative rules, if that indicates a nation, how would you feel about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I would agree with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Therefore, what is your opinion about co-habitation as a nation, according to this definition, under one constitution in one country, and what would your role and connection for the future be, given there are other people who are all part of this nation but not of the volk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Well as I've said, for the last four years I'm doing my bit for this so-called nation, but - I misunderstood it from the beginning then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you everybody in South Africa at the moment as South Africans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who are here now and who will be here in future?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Under the same constitution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In the same political process?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How do you feel about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you feel it's right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you feel positive about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you see any kind of future underneath this approach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And is your commitment 100%?  In other words, you will not prepare to break down or disrupt and say: "I don't want this person to be part of this country, I don't want this person to have his political say", or "that person of a certain colour or race or culture"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well then will you please return and answer the Chairperson's question within that context, and say how you feel about the future of this country and everybody living together in this country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> It could work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you think it will work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> I don't think it's up to me to decide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you will do your best to be part of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I understand you correctly then, that you are prepared to live with the concept that there are different nations within the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see that's not what I was talking about.  I was talking about a non-racial country, where there are no nations but only one South African nation.  Are you prepared to participate in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Chairperson, I would just like to make one point very clear.  Do you mean that if I marry a black woman, our children after that will be part of one nation?  Based upon that my answer is no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that's your own personal preference, I'm not talking about marriage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Then I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm talking of human rights.  I'm talking about people accepting, whether they be black, white or whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">MR SMIT:</span> Yes, that's correct, we'll accept one another if every nation can have its own culture and its own language within the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
