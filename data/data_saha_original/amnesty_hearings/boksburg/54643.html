<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is counsel ready to address us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairperson, before I begin with </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>the argument, I would like to request that the Committee receive </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>the video tapes which arrived from the Security Council, which </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>were referred to.  It is necessary that these cassettes are watched </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>in order to determine what the value of the statements are which </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>were put before the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>	The circumstances under which they were made, and which </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>led to the accuracy of these statements, and specifically in terms </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>of the conditions which prevailed and it will clearly be indicated </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>in our arguments and for that reason, it would be submitted as </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   These tapes have already been referred to in </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>the evidence and if at the end of the hearing, we consider it </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>necessary, we will view them unless your suggestion is that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>should do that now, a suggestion which I am not particularly </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>inclined to agree with at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Our suggestion is Mr Chairman, with respect, </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>that the Committee should receive them as an exhibit.  I am not </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>saying that we should view them today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   We will receive them, yes.  Mr Bizos, is there </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>any objection to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>MR BIZOS:   No Mr Chairman.  They should be, they are, I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>know precisely who is in possession of them now, but I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>suggest that we identify them by the number of tapes and video's </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>that there are, and that they remain in the possession of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>Committee's secretariat, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is there any indication as to where these are </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>at the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, they are in my possession at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>moment.  There are 21 tapes and may I suggest that during the </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>adjournment, we can just take it up with Mr Mpshe, he can </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>identify them, number them and then he will receive them.  Will </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>that be in order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that will be in order, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Sorry, you spoke of us admitting them as </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>exhibits.  I assumed those are the tapes that we haven't seen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Some were viewed partially Mr Chairman, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>others were not viewed.  In respect of Mr Derby-Lewis for </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>instance, that was never taken up with him, although they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>made available after he testified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>	As you will recall with respect Mr Chairman, those tapes </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>only became available after Mr Deetliefs arrived on the scene and </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>Mr Brandt started his examinations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Yes, do you have a problem if we at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>convenient time, we just look at them without necessarily </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>accepting them as exhibits?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   I beg your pardon Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Do you have a problem if we just have a </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>look at them in due course, without necessarily accepting them as </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>exhibits, as part of the record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   What my suggestion is Mr Chairman, receive </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>them as exhibits, and it could be viewed by the Committee </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>whenever it is convenient to the Committee, if it desires to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Please do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>MR BIZOS:   Mr Chairman, I am rather concerned that this </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>evidence has been in the possession of the applicants and their </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>legal representatives over this long period of time.  I have no </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>objection of them being put in as exhibits, but I submit that if </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>there is anything specific which the applicants want to draw </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>attention to, they must of necessity do so, they cannot put an </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>onus on the Committee or on us, to say well, you know there </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>maybe something there which was not referred to them in </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>argument, that we've had no opportunity of checking whether it </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>was there originally and without our being given an opportunity </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>to make any submission in relation to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>	That doesn't mean that I am objecting that they should go in </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>as an exhibit, on the other hand, we cannot have a carte blanche </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>that, or put an onus on the Committee to spend some 60 hours </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>viewing things in order to try and pick something up either for </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>the applicants or against the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>	It is a task which I submit that the Committee cannot be </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>asked to undertake.  If the applicants say that in tape number so </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>and so, this is what appears and we ask you to take it into </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>consideration, then we can deal with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>	We can't leave it as a loose matter, it is no different to a 1 </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>000 page document, to say I hand it in but somehow or other </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>there may be something in it that somebody may take into </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>consideration at some time or another, it is not the way to run a </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I understand and I imagine you accept that as </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>the position as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, with respect, we have already </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>referred to them in our heads of argument, we have already </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>requested in our heads of argument that these tapes ought to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>viewed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   No, but you will refer specifically to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>particular tapes that you want us to apply our minds to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That is correct Mr Chairman, and we also say </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>that particular tape ought to be viewed in its context, pertaining </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>to particular issues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   And Mr Chairman, just the other reason, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>tapes were given to us, there was, at that stage the idea of having </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>them transcribed.  It was taken up with the Department of Justice </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>by our Attorney, and they said that the costs would be too great </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>in order to have them transcribed, because they had to be re-</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>taped onto a tape cassette by the Broadcasting Corporation and </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>there was a lot of problems involved and it could not be done Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That is why we've got them back here now.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>Mr Chairman, those tapes were also in possession of Mr Bizos </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>and his team as well, they viewed them as well, so it is no secret </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>to no one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>MR BIZOS:   ... that this is the second or third time that it has </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>been mentioned that the Department of Justice said that they will </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>not authorise the expenditure.  The applicants have brought a </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>case Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>	We do not know on what basis this is placed on record, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>I will leave it at that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   One other point, I have been trying to find it </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>and I can't, I have a recollection that some tapes were in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>possession of Mrs Derby-Lewis and there was a suggestion that </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>she had erased portion of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>MR BIZOS:   No, that was settled, that was settled Mr Chairman, </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>in her favour, because what had happened was that we made that </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>suggestion and in fact we apologised to her for it, because the </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>tape had been copied in a wrong order.  What we expected to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>at the end of the tape, was not there, but it did appear at another </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>... And we may say Mr Chairman, I am reminded that I have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>too generous to Mrs Derby-Lewis, I did not make the suggestion, </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>Adv Brandt did.  We didn't have an opportunity of viewing it, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>spent the whole night viewing them, and came back with this </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>information which turned out to be wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Was this one of the same tapes as you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>now referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That is correct Mr Chairman.  In pursuance of </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>what Mr Bizos said, I suggested to the Committee that we will </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>have it transcribed, and this developed subsequent to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>adjournment period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>	Members of the Committee, we have already submitted </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>heads of argument and subsequently heads of argument have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>received from the members of the family.  These heads were </p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>received on the Thursday and unfortunately they were received </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>late.  Mr Bizos had other obligations, but we will leave it at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>	Honourable Chairperson, our heads have been discussed </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>thoroughly under various topics.   I would like to refer to a </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>number of aspects with reference to the testimony and in light of </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>the fact that further new evidence was submitted, since the </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>submission of the heads, and if preferred as such, we could submit </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>written heads of argument in response to Mr Bizos' heads of </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>argument to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>	I would like to argue with respect that the applicants firstly </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>complies with the provisions of the relevant Section 21(c) and </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>with specific reference to the applicant's action in support of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>Conservative Party, that he believed on a bona fide basis that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>was supporting the cause of the Conservative Party.  With </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>reference to the aspect of his actions in support of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>Conservative Party, I refer you to the judgment of the S v Maloi </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>and others in SA Court Reports, 1987 1 (196) (A), judgment of </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>Presiding Appeal Court, Judge Boshoff, and specifically on page </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>210, H - I and also on page 211, and 212 H - I.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>	With respect in this respect, I would like to argue that in </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>that judgment it was necessary that the party had to have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>aware of the actions which were undertaken by the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>	It is my argument that under these circumstances the </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>applicant who was an Executive Member of the Consecutive </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>Party, acted in support of the Party.  There is no evidence to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>contrary which supports that the applicant acted maliciously or </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>acted in any way for his own interests or to promote his own </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>interests.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>	The Committee with respect, should consider what the </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>political history of the country was, which preceded all these </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>events, where the country was governed by a white government, </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>which consisted of the National Party, later the Conservative </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>Party and the National Party which devolved by following a </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>different policy and had a vision of a unity State and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>Conservative Party's vision was that of separate development and </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>each nation governing itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>	This was the strong policy of the Conservative Party which </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>was not negotiable according to them, and in short, it took place </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>that the party according to the evidence of Dr Hartzenberg, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>leader of the Conservative Party, that the democratic process at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>stage, was closed and that negotiations would serve no further </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>purpose and that according to the evidence of Mr Derby-Lewis, </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>the Codesa negotiations were overwhelmed or dominated by </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>members of the Communist Party and as seen by the Conservative </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>Party, communist rule was at the order of the day and with </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>respect, this fact was a fact according to the people and the party </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>who believed that there was a threat which was eminent and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>there was no other option but to mobilise on all fronts, there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>talk of war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>	There was a climate of war.  Yesterday evidence was given </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>about it again, Visser and Clark, Dr Hartzenberg have all testified </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>in terms of this, the applicants have testified in terms of this, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>at this stage there are applications for amnesty which indicate or </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>which go as far as May 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>	I would like to argue with respect that it was not indicated </p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>to the contrary that it could be said that there was no state of </p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>undeclared war.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Mr Prinsloo, was the Conservative Party </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>part of the negotiation process when this event occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   It would appear that they were still involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>with it, but for them it was an indisputable fact that it was futile </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>to participate any further in the negotiation process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>	It would appear clearly even from discussions with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>deceased, Mr Chris Hani who said on the John Robby show the </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>objective was a unity State and that is what the Conservative </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>Party opposed, therefore for any person on the street who </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>supported the Conservative Party, these persons believed that if </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>there was an election in which the entire country participated, </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>that handful of people would not be able to put forward any other </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>ideology.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>	The policy of the National Party at that stage, was the unity </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>State and it was the opinion of the Conservative Party that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>National Party had thrown in the towel and that they had betrayed </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>the nation, that was the perception which existed in the society </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>among the white population and that is the society from which the </p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>applicant came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>	That was the basis upon which decisions were taken for </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>mobilisations, that was the basis of various speeches which were </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>made, referring to war and the use of other methods to prevent ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   May I just interrupt.  If during Codesa, when </p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>the major role players had gathered to try and solve the problems, </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>a group saw that Codesa would not serve their purpose and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>regarded that their particular cause was lost in these negotiations, </p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>that belief in a group of the people that negotiations would not </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>serve the purpose, that belief gave rise to unhappiness and </p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>aggressive talk on the part of such people, does that mean that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>must come to the conclusion that there was a climate of war, just </p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>because one section of the community did not accept the </p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>proceedings at Codesa?  Does that mean that there was a climate </p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>of war just because one section of the community did not have </p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>faith in these negotiations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chair, with respect at that stage </p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>many acts of aggression and violence were committed.  For </p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>example where Mr Botha blew up a school, many bomb explosions </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>	Many people were killed, and the talk of war and </p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>mobilisation indicated a conflict between two groups.  On the one </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>side, the ANC/SACP alliance which was mobilising for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>takeover of the country, and one would have to look at what </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>happened before that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>	The ANC by means of violence, which was its policy...</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   No, I am considering that we have already </p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>passed that stage of the ANC's struggle, we are talking about a </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>stage where there were these negotiations at Codesa.  At that </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>stage where the major role players were involved in discussing </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>what should happen to the future of this country, a group did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>view the proceedings at Codesa as serving their purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>	That view of that group and the conduct of its members in </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>resorting to violence, does that mean that we must come to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>conclusion that there was a climate of war, when the majority of </p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>the people and the other groups were trying to negotiate and one </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>group from outside, were not?  Does that mean there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>climate of war in the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, as it was understood there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>climate of war because a large proportion of the white population </p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>viewed this as a climate of war, and there was resistance against </p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>this and various groups made various statements which have </p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>already been submitted as evidence before you, and clearly there </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>was a climate of war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>	It was carried over as a fact that a resistance would take </p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>place, that the deceased was bringing in weapons from Angola, </p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>there was talk of when the ANC would lay down their weapons, </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>that history exists and with respect there was definitely a climate </p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>of war and it must be considered that a number of acts of violence </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>	This proved it self until the elections had taken place, there </p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>were many acts of violence which were done in opposition to this </p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>ANC/SACP takeover.  Visser testified yesterday that the ballot </p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>boxes be blown up to prevent people from voting, there were all </p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>those explosions which were actually about something else, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>the preceding history indicates that this climate did exist, and was </p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>promoted until the very last moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   What would be more relevant for our </p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>purposes, those deeds which he referred to, were those connected </p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>to the Conservative Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, Chairperson, connected to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>Right Wing Parties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Your client's case if I understand correctly, </p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>is that he acted in support of the Conservative Party with regard </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>to this incident, and I think it is of greater relevance for us to </p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>know to which degree this action was connected to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>Conservative Party, this might assist you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, you will remember that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>were various fronts who along with the Conservative Party </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>planned the same type of resistance in this country, and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>Conservative Party stood in conjunction with that proportion of </p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>the population who were planning this resistance in order to </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>prevent a government coming into power which they didn't want </p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>to come into power, a communist government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>	That is what they feared and it was a real and genuine fear </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>for every person who had been born during the years of the total </p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>onslaught and had learnt the meaning of communist in that </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>context.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>	The National Party and a number of its allies and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>Conservative Party, propagated this view and that is what was </p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>consistently portrayed and it could not be done away with </p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>overnight as a genuine fear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Do you draw any distinction in your mind </p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>between a communist government and a black majority </p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>government in the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairperson, as the witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>viewed it, as the society viewed it and as it was put forward in </p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>many cases, the ANC was the majority and the communist </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>government would be the minority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>	And upon those facts, it would appear that the control was </p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>placed in the hands of the Communist Party, although the ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>government would be the instrument whereby the government </p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>would be controlled and the country governed, and that is how I </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>understood it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>	Honourable Chairperson, at various moments, the evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>of the applicant was attacked in terms of the Conservative Party's </p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>lack of policy in terms of violence.  None of the political parties </p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>who functioned in this country, including the South African </p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>Police or any instruments of the State, had a determined or </p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>particular policy of violence which was officially recognised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>	If such a policy had existed, and if it had been announced, </p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>that party would not have had any kind of survival.  It would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>been regarded as a criminal party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Would the National Party in your belief, at </p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>that time, also believed in violence but did not want to disclose </p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairperson, with respect, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>National Party was in power and by means of its various organs, </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>which were involved in the conflict at that stage, the Police, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>Defence Force and various other institutions, the Commando's, </p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>and other such organisations which were involved in the struggle </p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>against the ANC, used these instruments and it came to light in </p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>various instances that the Police community came forward and </p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>said that they acted upon orders, or that the climate indicated </p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>that they acted upon orders, and the answer therefore is that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>National Party definitely maintained a policy of violence.  That it </p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>definitely existed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>	With respect, in various instances it appeared in the media </p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>that certain individuals were seen as targets, where members of </p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>the ANC were killed under various circumstances and this must </p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>have had a definite influence on this perception of war, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>of the policy of violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>	With respect, one cannot ignore the acts of violence which </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>were committed by the ANC.  A milieu of violence existed and it </p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>promoted itself or continued to exist until at least after the </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>election. This piece of history which occurred so swiftly, which </p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>perhaps in world history happened much quicker than what it </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>would have happened in other countries, nonetheless remains a </p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>fact that it occurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Do you say that we should find that the CP </p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>had an undeclared policy of violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   I would like to put it to you in this way that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>was definitely so if one considers that the leaders and various </p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>other individuals said that other methods needed to be used, other </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>than the democratic process, not by means of the ballot box.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>	That they would not be subjected to a communist </p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>government, that they would not give their country up.  How </p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>should it be interpreted, how would one interpret or combat that </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>resistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   You ask that we make the inference from </p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>the statements made by the leaders that the party indeed </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>maintained an undeclared policy of violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, that is what I am asking because </p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>if one considers what the party said in terms of mobilising, </p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>therefore people were advised to go over to mobilisation.  Passive </p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>versus active are described, and then it was left to those who </p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>would put it into operation, they had to interpret these statements </p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>in the broader sense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>	It was said we will not give up our country, we will fight </p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>for it.  The leader of the Conservative Party, Dr Treurnicht, said </p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>that he would not serve under a communist government or under </p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>President Mandela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>	If it was as such, how could it then have been interpreted in </p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>the light of these statements.  Also in terms of the statements that </p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>the Conservative Party made that Codesa was a futile exercise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   It was one thing for a leader to say I will not </p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>serve under Dr Mandela, it is perfectly reasonable for people of </p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>standing to say that they will not serve under a government, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>is not the same as saying that I am going to go to war to see that </p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>I am in government in the place of him.  Isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, we should not view this in terms </p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>of compartments, but in a holistic sense.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>	What these leaders said, what Dr Hartzenberg said, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>various individuals such as Snyman said, for example, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>mobilisation, the various acts which were committed, the stock </p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>piling of weapons and acts of violence were being committed, </p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>what would be the interpretation of these facts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>	Especially in light of a statement where someone says that </p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>he would not serve under such and such a government?  It is </p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>threatening, it is quite obviously eminent that the unity State </p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>would occur as envisioned by the ANC and the SACP, it wasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>something which was part of the further future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>	At that stage the elections took place, in April 1994, as we </p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   I am just trying to clear up this aspect, </p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>what must we make of the evidence of Dr Hartzenberg which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>clearly indicating that the SACP or that the CP did not have a </p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>policy of violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>	He could not have said that they had a policy of violence, if </p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>he had said so the CP would not have continued to exist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   I understand the point that you are making, </p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>but here, under oath before us, he confirmed that the CP did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>have such a policy and that it would have been understandable </p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>that some of the supporters might have believed that such a policy </p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>of violence existed, but he maintained that the CP did not have </p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>such a policy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, he indeed said that there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>climate of violence which was created by the CP, that is a fact.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>He also maintained that the CP believed in the existence of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>policy of violence, but then one would have to think about it </p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>objectively and I believe that the Committee will do so and ask </p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>the question what did exist if that scenario was sketched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>	Then one cannot say anything else but the fact that the CP </p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>did promote a policy of violence, that violence should be used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>	But how else would one prevent a party from coming into </p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>government if one couldn't prevent it at the ballot boxes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>	I do not like to make comparisons, but just how look at </p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>how successful the ANC was by using violence and forcing the </p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>government to give over the country.  Various voices in the world </p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>had said do away with apartheid, and still there was no success.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>Only until the ANC had used violence, did it actually bring about </p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>a measure of success.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   I would not like spend too much time on </p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>this point, yet I do understand what you are saying.  You have </p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>said that there was an undeclared state or policy of violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, these are not conflicting </p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>statements because there was not an officially declared policy of </p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>	But that climate coupled with the evidence in a holistic </p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>sense, compile a series of facts and it would be unfair to expect </p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>that parties within this country, according to this legislation, </p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>should have maintained a policy of violence while the ANC/SACP </p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>alliance from the outside, were untouchable and maintained and </p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>announced policy of violence, which they applied in every </p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>instance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>	In that respect one should look at the fairness of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>application of the law.  There should be an equal application of </p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>the law, and on that basis it was stated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Can you take that debate a little bit further? </p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a> I think you have made your point about that.  Suppose we do </p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>find that there was no such a policy, declared or undeclared, </p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>where does this leave your client's case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Do you mean that none of the evidence or the </p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>witnesses which I've sketched at this point, existed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   The CP did not have such a policy?  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   A policy which said that one shouldn't, or that </p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>one should kill people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   You - let's assume that we do find that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>CP did not have the policy to kill people, to assassinate people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   An announced policy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Whether declared or undeclared, we do find </p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>that they didn't have any such policy at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect Mr Chairman, I want to argue </p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>that the climate was there, and that the client subjectively </p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>believed that there was such a climate.  The climate was created </p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>as I have already told the Honourable Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>	The climate was there.  He in a bona fide way believed </p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>there was such a climate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   A person in the position of Mr Derby-Lewis </p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>who was close to the leaders of the party, would you argue that </p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>subjectively he believed, even though the CP did not have such a </p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>policy, declared or otherwise, he himself, as an individual, despite </p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>his position in the party, despite his close relationship with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>leaders, subjectively believed that there was such a policy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairperson, with respect if you </p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>look at the judgment or the statements of the leaders, the climate, </p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>the happenings in the country, is that what he believed he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>part of the leadership, he was involved in that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>	They participated in various processes.  In Krugersdorp for </p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>example he committed some things, various things were done </p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>against the Conservative Party.  Koos Botha, there is a dispute </p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>about that, apart from him, nobody else was repudiated. </p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>	With respect Mr Chairman, the witness said that he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>spoken about Dr Treurnicht and he said regarding the aspect of </p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>killing the anti-Christ, and he said he is not holding it against Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>Hani as a person, but against the Communist Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>	And also the declared policy of the Conservative Party was </p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>that they would not tolerate a takeover and compare it Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>Chairman, with cases which have already served, for example </p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>cases from the ANC, for example in Messina.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>	The ANC themselves decided they take out a leader in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>name of Mr Lukela and other people.  They have done that with a </p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>political motive, they have done that to force this government to </p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>overthrow the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>	And with respect, it worked, and here the Conservative </p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>Party said we are going to fight fire with fire, we are not going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>use conventional methods and he forms part of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>	They said we have to mobilise, we have to act in a resistant </p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>way and while this process is in the near future, how else could </p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>that be interpreted?  It could not have been otherwise, that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>was a quiet to put it that way, policy that violence could be used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>	What form of violence, that could not be prescribed.  In any </p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a>war situation, in any violence committed during war, in a bush </p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a>war and underground activities, you cannot expect otherwise.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>Just as in the case of Police when they killed various people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   I was talking about Mr Derby-Lewis who </p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>was a very senior person.  I am not talking about foot soldiers, </p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>who may not know what the policy of the organisation is.  I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>referring to Mr Derby-Lewis, precisely because of his position in </p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>the party and I would have thought that he would know at any </p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>given time, exactly what the policy of the party was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairman, this is the problem I </p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a>have with the legislation.  If you ask what is the policy of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>party, if he said his co-leaders would go over to violence, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>they said themselves, what more evidence could there be that </p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>there was violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Well, what you are saying is that there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>time when Dr Hartzenberg and Mr Derby-Lewis did not have a </p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a>common understanding of the policy of the party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, I am not saying that.  I myself </p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>am saying that they would not have used conventional methods </p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>any more.  The debate is about what ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   No, we are talking assassinations Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>Prinsloo.  The way Dr Hartzenberg understood the policy of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>party, the assassination of people was never part of it and you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>saying in the mind of Mr Derby-Lewis, assassinations would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>been part of that policy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect Mr Chairman, it has never been </p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a>the ANC's policy to assassinate people, they have never said </p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>explicitly we are going to assassinate people, this shouldn't be </p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>viewed in isolation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>	It should be seen holistically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Mr Prinsloo, I want to know from you </p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>whether you are saying, is your argument that there was, there </p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a>must have been a time when Dr Hartzenberg understood the </p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>policy of the CP differently from Mr Derby-Lewis, when it came </p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>to killings or assassinations?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>	Are you saying Dr Hartzenberg and others' view was that </p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>the killing was not part of the policy whereas a person like Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>Derby-Lewis might have in his subjective mind, thought that that </p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>was the policy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect Mr Chairman, at that stage it </p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>could not be said that Mr Hartzenberg in his mind, had the idea of </p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a>assassination, but what was clear from his evidence was that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>would be resistance, mobilisation and conventional methods </p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>would not be used any more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a>	This is evident also in the case of Koos Botha who has also </p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a>applied for amnesty, he committed violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Mr Prinsloo, I am sorry.  Judge Ngoepe's </p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>point is actually how can a subjective belief in the case of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>Derby-Lewis given his leadership position in the party, how can </p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>such a subjective belief be bona fide?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, it cannot be argued that which </p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a>method had to be used, that that subjective view is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>	You cannot say we are going to blow up a house, we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>going to shoot somebody, we are going to poison somebody, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>are going to keep food from them, anything would be an efficient </p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>method.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   No, the question is about policy.  Judge </p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a>Ngoepe asked you should the Committee find that there was no </p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a>such declared or undeclared policy, where does it leave your </p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>client's case, then you said that he subjectively believed in a bona </p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a>fide way that it was the policy of the party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a>	Now, I am asking you how could it be bona fide in the case </p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>of Mr Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Hartzenberg said that it, what he said </p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>indicated violence.  What he had in his mind was what he believed </p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>subjectively and he himself said Derby-Lewis could have believed </p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a>that subjectively.   He himself thought that, how else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Is it bona fide for a person who had direct </p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a>access to the Chief leader of the party, that he is there where </p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>things are happening, could that be bona fide for such a person, </p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>to think wrongly that a policy of violence existed?  That is my </p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, he could have never believed </p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a>wrongly in the climate of that time.  As I have already said what </p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>they have stood for and what the threat was and what the state of </p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>war was in that climate, he subjectively believed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>	He was part of the party, he was in the top structure and </p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>then it cannot be expected that he would go to Hartzenberg and </p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>said listen, I am going to kill Mr Chris Hani, that would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>been the end of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>	It would have been ridiculous.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   It is not about a policy in such strong </p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>terms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   It is about the climate which existed, and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>forthcoming from that in which he subjectively believed would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>in the interest of the party to promote this party and to prevent </p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>that a communist government, would come in to govern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>	And what else could we do if there were no other methods? </p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a> With respect, by taking out a leader this was an efficient method </p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>at that stage.  It was the same as to overthrow the whole country </p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>at the ballot box.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   But Mr Hartzenberg said that the policy of </p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a>the Conservative Party was to act in a defensive capacity, so that </p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>they would be in a better moral position, they planned throughout </p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>to take up a defensive position.  That is why you are being asked </p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>these questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>	That was the policy of the Conservative Party, to take up a </p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>defensive position, to mobilise themselves so that they could </p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>defend themselves.  How could someone have believed that it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>in the interest of the party to sacrifice the moral position and go </p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>out and assassinate somebody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect Mr Chairman, what I am trying </p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>to say is this is what Hartzenberg said, but it was also said that </p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>they would not subject themselves to the government under </p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>communist rule, how would it be done otherwise?	</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>	How could it be prevented?  How could it be defensive, </p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>how could you defend what, if the country is not being attacked? </p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a> What do you understand by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>	With respect Mr Chairman, this mobilisation through </p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a>resistance was to prevent that the country would be taken over </p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>and this was what happened afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>	With respect, the leader could not say that he would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>planned to kill people, or would have allowed people to be killed. </p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a> That would have been an offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   But Mr Prinsloo, the idea of a whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>mobilisation strategy, was to stage a visible demonstration of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>CP people against the government with a view of achieving a </p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>political objective, which in a way is merely defensive and not </p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>pro-active?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That would have been one method Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>Chairman, surely.  Just as the ANC had various structures and </p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>they said we would make the country ungovernable.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>mobilised the church for example and they mobilised, a pattern </p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>was created by the ANC how you mobilise and how the various </p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>structures were intruded or invaded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>	How do you prevent it otherwise?  A climate was created in </p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>the country, how violence was being practised.  How people </p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a>interpreted it, how the CP said we will fight fire with fire, what is </p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a>the fire?  It is the threat of an overthrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Was part of the complaint or rather the </p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>grievance of the CP really directed at the NP, wasn't it?  That it </p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>believed that the NP was selling out the Afrikaner people and </p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a>those who believed in the policy of the CP, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairman, it is stated in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>applicant's evidence, but at that stage the National Party was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>a factor any more.  The CP and the applicant believed that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>were not in government any more, and that the takeover was </p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>(indistinct), it would have been without any purpose to kill the </p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>leader of the National Party, because according to the CP, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a>didn't mean anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>	He had already thrown in the towel.  It was a question of </p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>the resistance, the conflict was between the ANC/SACP and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a>CP and the people wanted to prevent that the country ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   Mr Prinsloo, you have previously referred to </p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a>a situation which was caused by the CP leaders, in that through </p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>their speeches they promoted the use of violence.  Is it not true </p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>that in fact the CP leaders were merely prognosticating about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>possible use of violence in the future, in the event of all their </p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a>options having become exhausted and that in fact could not have </p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a>been reasonably interpreted even by Mr Derby-Lewis, to have </p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a>been tantamount to a policy of violence by the CP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairman, those methods that </p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a>you've mentioned, they were said and according to Hartzenberg's </p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>evidence, it is clear that those other possibilities and other </p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>processes were non-existent at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>	The democratic process did not exist any more and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>climate at that stage, when that took place, and preceding that, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a>should be looked at all the Right Wing groups which had the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a>purpose, that is to remember that ANC/SACP would rule the </p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a>country, and the history speaks for itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   But I don't think that was the evidence of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>Hartzenberg.  He conceded that the constitutional part was </p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>constantly being eroded at that time.  But that still remained an </p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a>option and they were still party to the Codesa talks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairperson, that is what he said, </p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a>but he said the chances were few.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a>	According to the evidence by the applicant, it was that </p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>Codesa was ruled by the ANC/SACP alliance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   (speaker's microphone not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>MR PRINSLOO: With respect Mr Chairman, in those </p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>circumstances in that climate and the applicant considered the </p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>way how this takeover should be prevented on behalf of the party, </p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>because on behalf of whom did he have to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>	He did not belong to any other party, he did not support </p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>any other political party.  He supported the Conservative Party, </p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>he lived for the political party and that is proven by his history, </p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>and with respect the Conservative Party never repudiated him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a>	I am not talking about the assassination, I am referring to </p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>his other actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But Mr Prinsloo, why did he not clear out </p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a>this intention regarding Hani with the CP leadership, he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a>access to the top leadership?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect Mr Chairman, a man in Mr Hani's </p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a>position, who was loved by the greatest majority of the black </p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>population, they supported him, that was a fact, and there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>fact that there was going to be a takeover.  They would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a>given their lives to force this government to a takeover, how </p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>would they now turn around and say we are willing to give little </p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a>bits and pieces of the country to this and that, and while John </p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>Robby said he wouldn't do that, how could that have happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>	What purpose would it have served, what did he have to </p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>clear out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Why did he not clear it out with his own </p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>party?  Why did he not discuss it with the Conservative Party </p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>leadership to take this radical step to assassinate a political </p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   As I have already said Mr Chairman, if he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>gone to the top leadership in the Conservative Party and told </p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>them that he was going to kill Chris Hani, it with respect, would </p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>have meant that he and Treurnicht would have landed in jail, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>then the Conservative Party would have been the end of the party. </p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>	If you take the leader away, the party would have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>disbanded.  You would remember that Von Lieres and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a>Attorney General stated it to Mrs Derby-Lewis, that was </p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>effective, take the leader out and then the party falls apart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>	If you had to clear that out, he and other people </p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>compromised themselves to committing an offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>	That is not logistics in a war situation.  I don't want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>make a comparison but it worked very well in regard to the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   You see, you are reacting and you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>based on a position that Treurnicht would have said go out and </p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>kill him and kill all the others, and if he said no, Derby-Lewis, </p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>this is not the policy of this party, then Treurnicht would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>not been part of an offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   It could have been an option yes, but at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>moment he did that, he became part of that and this leader of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a>party would have become part of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Could it not be argued that he did not do it </p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>because he knew it was not the policy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, without referring to the policy </p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>again at length, this would go against everything because then he </p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>would involve and this would be a conspiracy, it would have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>a conspiracy with the Conservative Party to commit an offence, </p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>and the party would land in jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>	Now, he would do it on his own, without involving other </p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   That would have been the consequence of </p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a>the policy then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   That would have been the consequence of </p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a>their policy if they would have landed in jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, if that policy was declared, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>would have landed in jail, without even having done something.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a>If they have said openly that they would commit violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   You said his leader Mr Treurnicht, would </p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a>have landed in jail with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   But Mr Prinsloo, I mean you say that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>would have been impossible for him to clear that with the leader, </p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>Mr Treurnicht, because of a possible arrest with Mr Derby-Lewis, </p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a>but he had previously cleared with Mr Treurnicht, the issue of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a>anti-Chris, the killing of an anti-Christ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   He cleared with respect Mr Chairman, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>principle of killing it, he didn't say he will kill somebody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   And couldn't he have done the same with </p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a>regard to the killing of a political leader?  Clearing the principle </p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a>and not the actual deed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect Mr Chairman, if you say you will </p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>kill a leader, then you are committing yourself to killing a leader </p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a>who is in existence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   We are dealing here with an issue which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>not crystal clear, the killing, assassination of leaders of political </p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a>organisations, wasn't a policy which was as crystal clear to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>CP and why shouldn't he have done that, why couldn't he have </p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a>cleared that principle with Mr Treurnicht?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>	He had a very close association with Mr Treurnicht, he also </p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a>had a very close association with Mr Hartzenberg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairman, as soon as the killing </p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>of a leader was mentioned, people would put two and two </p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a>together and compromise this person.  Why would he ask that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   I think at the end of the day your problem is </p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a>there was, you are saying there was a political party, it didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a>have the courage of accepting the policy which would put them </p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a>into jail, however, you are now constraint to argue in some way, </p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a>that there was in fact a policy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>	When those people themselves, perhaps for sensible reasons </p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a>I don't know, whereas those people themselves, because they </p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a>didn't want to go to jail, they didn't have such a policy, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>didn't have the courage of coming out and declaring it, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a>they didn't want to jail, they might have gone to jail, you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a>right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a>	But now you find yourself in a situation where by reason of </p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a>the fact that those political leaders did not have the courage to </p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a>openly admit violence as a method for fear of going to jail, now </p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>you are at a disadvantage now, you are constraint to argue in </p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a>some way, that oh, no, there must have been such a policy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, with respect, I am not limited </p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a>to that.  The National Party up till today, will not agree that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a>had such a policy, but the evidence is clear that there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a>policy like that, because they kept the National Party in </p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a>government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   All I am saying is that they are putting the </p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a>applicants to some extent, in a difficult position.  They are </p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a>making it a little bit difficult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, it is so, but it goes back a far </p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a>way.  They could not have had a declared policy of violence, </p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a>because they would have then been incarcerated.  The National </p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a>Party would have liked it to incarcerate the Conservative Party if </p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a>they supported violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   But for purposes of the present application, </p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a>it wouldn't have been so difficult for the leaders of the CP to </p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>have come before this Committee to disclose that there was such </p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>a policy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairman, I don't know whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a>one of them would admit that.  I don't know whether they had a </p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a>policy like that, who would come here and say I have committed </p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a>an offence without having applied for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a>	Should a leader have done that and based on the argument </p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a>that he could do it, it would mean that a question would be put </p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a>behind that party.  Now, they agree that they were busy with </p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>violence and now the history has developed and there is quite a </p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a>different approach at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a>	At the moment it has to do with reconciliation, we are not </p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a>concerned with what had happened in the past.  The party at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>moment has the same objectives, but they want to follow a </p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a>peaceful road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   Mr Hartzenberg was quite emphatic on this </p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a>issue, he stated that violence could not be used at that stage by </p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a>the CP to achieve any of their political objections, that was his </p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a>evidence.  That is my problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   The problem Mr Chairman, is viewed in </p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a>isolation.  While this interview was held and said are you against </p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a>violence, naturally he had to say yes, we were against violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a>	We were against violence in its broadest sense, but violence </p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a>for a specific purpose is a different question.  We could see it in </p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a>relation why was it committed, what was the motive, what caused </p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a>it, we should all see this as one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a>	With respect, according to Dr Hartzenberg, it was seen as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a>full scale war.  How does one wage war without violence, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>amazes me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   You defend yourself against the attack.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a>Hartzenberg stressed that the attitude of the party would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a>defensive, to defend itself against attack, to have the moral high </p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a>ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   He did say so, that is correct.  But in terms of </p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>the background of the climate, it must be considered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   In the background of the climate you talk </p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>about, there was a statement by Dr Treurnicht at Paardekraal was </p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a>it, where he said that we must prepare for the next war, words to </p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Now, that statement about we must prepare </p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a>for another war, rested there because at no stage did the party </p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>say we have now declared war.  Have the party said that we have </p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a>now declared war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Nobody said we have declared war Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>Chairman, with respect, there was a war in existence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   So now why they said that we must now </p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a>prepare for war, we must arm ourselves and so on, that doesn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a>mean that we have now declared war?  It means that we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a>preparing for a war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a>	In that situation without a war being declared, an attempt is </p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a>made, or rather assassination is made of a high profile political </p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a>figure, without a war being declared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>	That assassination cannot then be said to be part of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a>policy because the policy is prepare for war, when we declare the </p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>war, then we will take control.  All right, the war was never </p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a>declared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a>	An assassination is carried out and quite clearly that </p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a>happened without the CP declaring a war, albeit it at that time </p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a>there was evidence of violence of various sides in the country and </p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a>so on, but that violence in the country had been carrying on for </p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a>some time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>	But at this crucial time of the killing of Chris Hani, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a>Nationalist Party had never taken the decision to in fact declare </p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a>war, had it, the CP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairperson, there was never any </p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a>declaration of war, but a war did exist.  With respect, if one </p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a>compares this to the period when the ANC and the SACP waged </p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>their war, there was no expressed declaration of war, but there </p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>was a struggle and a fight, and a struggle consists of two sides, </p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>one shoot the other, one plant bombs towards the other, one kill </p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a>the other, but there was killing on both sides, but the perception </p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a>existed that a war existed and furthermore tat during this time, </p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a>there was a particular war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>	And that is what the witnesses said yesterday, they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>called here independently and the testified that they perceived it </p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>as a war.  In those circumstances it was regarded as a war, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a>the circumstances which had to be prevented would be the </p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a>takeover of the ANC and SACP while the National Party had lost </p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a>its course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>	That is what they were prepared to do in order to prevent </p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a>this.  That is the objective that the applicant held.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>	Honourable Chairperson, as I have already stated, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a>target which was set, was Mr Chris Hani to bring that particular </p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a>party to its knees, to take out the leadership so to speak, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a>then further problems or to combat further problems that existed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>	I would like to argue with respect that the applicant, as we </p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a>have already referred to in our heads, falls within the category of </p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>Section 20(2)(a) and (2)(d).  With reference to the criteria, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a>have ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   I beg your pardon Mr Prinsloo, before you </p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a>move on from that point.  Section 20(2)(d), which of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a>possibilities does your client support for his case?  Does he </p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>maintain that he was a member of the CP, and he acted within the </p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>ambit of his duties or that he acted within the ambit of his </p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>express or sworn capacity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   I would like to explain it as follows.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a>applicant had certain duties which were explicit, that was </p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>mobilisation and the resistance to the ANC and SACP.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>resistance to the takeover of the SACP and ANC, in terms of his </p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>capacity, it involved the methods which he would apply in order </p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>to carry out this resistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a>	These duties of mobilisation for resistance and stock piling </p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>of weapons, were issued and that was within his sworn capacity.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a>But as far as it involves 20(2)(c) ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   I understand 20(2)(a) is quite obvious to </p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a>follow, I am more interested in 20(2)(d).  You are saying that his </p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a>case is that as part of his duties in the mobilisation campaign, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a>launched this action, this assassination of Mr Hani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   As I have said, the resistance which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a>announced by the CP to prevent that the ANC and SACP come </p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a>into power, seen in the broader sense, all the speeches the </p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a>negotiations of the CP leadership, these were all methods of </p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a>prevention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a>	It was part of his duty, his sworn capacity and duties. </p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   So this was part of his duties within the CP </p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>as an office bearer, a senior office bearer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   And he also had a sworn capacity to carry </p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a>this out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   According to what did he have that </p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a>capacity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   In terms of what was said by the CP, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a>they announced that they would go forward into resistance to </p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a>prevent the ANC and SACP from coming into power.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Then I want to say with respect, he acted in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a>bona fide capacity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>	In so far as it affects Section 20(3) the motive is discussed </p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a>in our heads and I have already referred to that.  I would like to </p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>argue with respect, that the context within which this offence was </p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>committed, it was committed during a time when a political </p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a>struggle existed between the CP and the ANC and SACP alliance, </p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a>and their allies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Where are you in your heads of argument, can </p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a>you just tell me please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   I was just going according to the Section now </p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a>Mr Chairman.  I will just let my colleague find it in the meantime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>	Just a moment please Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, quite all right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   It appears on page 53 of the heads of </p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a>argument.  It begins at paragraph 2 and proceeds to page 54, </p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a>which refers to other aspects as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, the only other aspect which I </p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a>would like to deal with, which is also referred to, is paragraph </p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a>23(f), the relation between the action and the political objective, </p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a>specifically the proportionality.  In terms of the evidence of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>witnesses who maintained that the leaders had to be killed and </p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a>what the consequences of such deeds would be. </p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>	With respect one must specifically consider the time, point </p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a>in time when the action was taken and what the objective was.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a>The objective was to prevent that there would be an ANC/SACP </p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>takeover, which was an eminent threat at that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a>	And that takeover which was a threat, must be weighed up </p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a>in conjunction with the policy of the party that they were opposed </p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a>to it, the feelings created amongst the followers, these two </p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a>aspects must be balanced.  If there would be an ANC/SACP </p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a>overthrow, it would be over, it would be like a death sentence, </p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a>there was a great feeling of finality regarding that, within that </p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a>context.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a>	Therefore within that context, to take out a leader would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a>an act of prevention and within the context of war, which they </p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a>believed existed, to take out the leader would prevent that </p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a>alliance from coming into power and prevent the disadvantages </p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a>and the threat which existed for the CP as a party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   I was wondering whether you are comparing </p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a>correct situations because I thought when you speak of </p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a>proportionality, you would compare the ultimate objective not </p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a>with the assassination per se, as an event, but with what they told </p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a>us in so many words, was what they wanted to achieve, namely to </p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a>create chaos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a>	To create a chaotic situation during which possibly </p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a>thousands of innocent people would be killed during that </p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a>confusion, because they said they wanted to create a confusion </p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a>during which the Right Wing would take over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a>	Now, I think maybe you should, when you speak of </p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a>proportionality, you should compare the ultimate objective with </p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a>the scenario that they wanted to bring about, the chaotic situation </p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a>that they could have brought about, that they wanted to bring </p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a>about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chair, I understand what you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a>referring to that chaos was the objective, and that various people </p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a>would be killed in the process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a>	That a racial war would occur and as I also understand it in </p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a>this aspect, during that time period when this killing would take </p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>place, the Police and the Army would take over and they would </p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a>recreate order, and that that takeover would be intercepted, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a>is how I understood it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a>	What I would like to propose is that the objective which </p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a>they held, in comparison to the actions that they took, as well as </p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a>the consequences which it held, in conjunction with the idea that </p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a>the Army and the Police would take over, and that the system </p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a>would be reinstated, and that the parties and the leadership on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a>Right Wing, would be reconciled and take over, it would result in </p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a>a greater level of reconciliation and cooperation between the </p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a>Right Wing leadership, that would have been the objective as </p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a>well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Well, I thought I understood your evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a>to be that a situation would in consequence develop, a situation </p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a>of chaos, and the Police and the Army, there would be a situation </p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a>when they would not be in control, and in that milieu, then the </p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a>Right Wing would then grab power or something to that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairperson, that is how the </p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a>testimony devolved, but the leadership would also come together </p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a>again, the Right Wing leaders and they would utilise the situation </p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a>and reinstate order and prevent any further ANC/SACP takeover.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Well, if the Police and the Army came in and </p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a>restored the order, that would have been prevailing before the </p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a>assassination, what would they have benefitted then, what would </p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a>the Right Wing have benefitted, except that people would just </p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a>have been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect Honourable Chairperson, if a </p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>leader would be taken out from the SACP, the objective was to </p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>make the party disintegrate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a>	Mr Hani as a leader was seen as a successor to Mr Mandela, </p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>he was a strong leader who had a lot of supporters and to take </p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a>him out, would create confusion and chaos.  It would have the </p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a>same influence of blowing up the ballot boxes and bringing about </p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a>chaos, in order to make people afraid of voting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a>	It would create that kind of situation, it would bring the </p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a>National Party to another type of insight, where they would </p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a>realise that there were elements who did not want this process to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>take place, that certain things had to be reconsidered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Are you suggesting the Nationalist Party did </p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a>not know that there were certain elements who did not want this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a>to take place, weren't they told that time and again by the Right </p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a>Wing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Are you also suggesting that if the Police </p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a>and the Army and the Right Wing took over, there would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a>been peace in our land?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairman ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Do you think Mr Derby-Lewis could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a>believed that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairman, what he believed under </p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a>the circumstances was that it should be prevented that the ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a>and SACP take over and that is why those methods had to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a>used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a>	Whether or not there would have been peace, is a matter of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a>speculation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Mr Prinsloo, I think that is exactly the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a>problem which is emerging here.  All these situations and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a>scenario's which you have sketched, are supposition, very loose </p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a>suppositions, and let us assume that after Mr Hani was murdered, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a>and that this chaos had ensued, or that the chaos had not ensued.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Well, then another decision would have to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a>taken regarding further steps.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Was there any contingency plan which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a>suggested?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   If I understand the evidence correctly, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a>applicant would have consulted certain actions within his party </p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a>but that went wrong, because Walus was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   The question was it not a very reckless </p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a>form of behaviour to unleash something so loosely, something </p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a>which could so easily move out of control, without any definite </p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a>structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a>	Was that not out of proportion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   If one considers that even members of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a>Police have planned to kill Mr Hani in the past, that this surely </p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a>must have exercised some kind of influence that it would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>some kind of consequence to take out such a leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>	To take out a leader, would definitely have the consequence </p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a>of disbanding the party, so regrouping would be necessary and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a>reorganisation would be necessary, and such an action would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a>definitely have had this sort of effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   May I just ask you, are you telling me that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a>must accept that an acute, trained, experienced politician, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a>seriously believed that the killing of Chris Hani was going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a>cause chaos in the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, that is what he believed.  That </p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a>is what he maintains in his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I understand that that is the evidence, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a>understand that that is the case you are making out, but isn't it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a>more likely that the chaos was not going to be caused by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a>single death of one man, but the plan went very much further, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a>to cause chaos effective chaos, to enable the CP and others to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a>take control, would mean eliminating a whole group of leaders </p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a>and only then would there be chaos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a>	As things stand, if he believed that the killing of Chris Hani </p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a>itself would cause such chaos, then quite clearly he has </p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a>miscalculated the position terribly, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairperson, with respect, during </p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a>the 1976 unrest, by shooting one single student by the name of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a>Petersen, total chaos was unleashed in Soweto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I can understand something happening in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a>Soweto at this time, I am not talking about an experienced </p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a>parliamentarian, a politician of considerable experience.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, by killing someone like Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a>Hani, with respect it would have then - one could have assumed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a>that this would have taken place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Are you really saying that he genuinely </p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a>believed that the killing of Hani would produce the necessary </p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a>chaos in the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Subjectively he believed it, and with respect, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a>according to the circumstances, that belief was bona fide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   I suppose you could say particularly if the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a>murderer had not been apprehended, I suppose you could argue </p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a>that there could very well have been serious consequences?  I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a>trying to help you, I am not against you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, I appreciate that, but one must </p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a>consider both sides of the circumstances.  If the murderer had not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a>been caught, what would the people have said, our leader has </p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a>been killed, it is the National Party who are in power, who did </p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a>this, they are allowing it, that is what Mr Mandela said at one </p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a>point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a>	He said that the National Party had criminalised the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a>deceased, Mr Hani, that they had marked him as a target.  If one </p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a>considers that, then that argument of yours could be extremely </p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a>valid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   We will take a short adjournment at this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a>stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a>COMMISSION ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   On behalf of and in support of such an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a>organisation, to support a political struggle in a bona fide way, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a>which is waged against the State.  Here is referred to a political </p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a>struggle, not a policy and there was a political struggle between </p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a>the CP and the SACP and the applicant's evidence is that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a>committed this act to promote that political struggle, which </p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a>existed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a>	By eliminating a leader of a party, it could be interpreted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a>be to the benefit of that party, the CP because the opponent's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a>leader was eliminated, it is to their detriment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a>	This would then promote this political struggle, or had this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a>purpose in mind apart from a policy, but it depends on the nature </p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a>of the political struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a>	With respect the political struggle which existed, was of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a>nature that the SACP/ANC would not give in.  They wanted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a>take over, there were threats of violence.  There were even </p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a>threats in the past, that leaders of the Conservative Party would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a>be eliminated and other things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   In other words, you can't have a non-</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>violent political struggle by means of violence, that is the point.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>The nature of that political struggle, that is the importance of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>policy of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect Mr Chairman, there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a>political struggle and that struggle, violence was part of that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a>struggle in that milieu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   That is a different point.  I wanted to draw </p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a>your attention to the nature of the political struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   The rest I have already submitted to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a>Honourable Committee, what the struggle was, and what the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a>objectives of the party were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Sorry, do you say that the application is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a>under 20(2)(a)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   So (f) does not apply?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a>ADV PRINSLOO:   Yes, (f) does apply as well Mr Chairman, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a>because it covers 22(a) and (d).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   My copy of the Act which I was given, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a>told was completely up to date says any person referred to in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a>paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   (a), (b), (c) and (d), according to mine, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a>Chairman.  I don't know, mine might be a wrong one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   We will clear that up, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Thank you.  Mr Chairman, the other aspect is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a>about full disclosure, and here I am referring to various </p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a>witnesses.  The applicant and others, but specifically I want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a>refer to later witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a>	Mrs Venter was called here, and with respect I want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a>argue that Mrs Venter was a very good witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a>	Her evidence was clear that on the 10th of March, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a>firearm had been taken out of her house to Mr Derby-Lewis, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a>she moved into the house at the beginning of March.  On the 10th </p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a>of April, she saw Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a>	Mrs Derby-Lewis' evidence regarding her products, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a>Sportron products is indisputable and she did not remember a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a>previous statement she made, and she gave a very good </p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a>explanation of what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a>	As you can see from her evidence, I could not see it myself, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a> you asked whether she had signed and it was taken away, she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a>supported this evidence and she was a very good witness and she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a>supported Mrs Derby-Lewis' evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a>	Mr du Randt with respect, I wanted to argue he is not an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a>intelligent person you expected.  The documentary facts supports </p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a>his evidence that there was an election for a Mayor, that was also </p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a>his election in the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a>	On that day, and according to the programme it took place </p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a>on the 10th of March 1993, and a jersey would have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a>delivered and with respect, I want to say under the circumstances, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a>it cannot be said that Mr du Randt was part of a conspiracy.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a>or Mrs du Randt regarding this aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a>	A jersey was delivered, in his innocence he came here and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a>he gave evidence here, he gave evidence in the Supreme Court, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a>was not regarded as a co-conspirator.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a>	The same applies to Mrs Venter.  She did not testify in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a>Supreme Court case, but it is clear from her statement provided </p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a>to the State, that they had to accept with respect, that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a>evidence of her husband, Mr Faan Venter is supported by hers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Sorry, I don't want to hold you up unduly, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a>but with regard to Mr du Randt, what is his  evidence?  Was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a>weapon handed over to Mr Derby-Lewis before his daughter's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a>birthday or after or is it just a confused aspect in his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, it is very clear if you look at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a>this evidence in the Supreme Court, that he was led, he was led </p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a>by Mr Von Lieres, he also gave this evidence here, and in that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a>said the witness is not sure, he was referred to the 25th of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a>February, then he referred to the election of the Mayor, that is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a>fixed date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>	That date is fixed and that is also ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Except that he was not even consistent here </p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a>before us, he would go backwards and forwards on that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, he had a problem with this, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a>he was led, it should be taken into consideration, he was led by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a>the fact that this election took place on the 10th of March and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a>therefore he was convinced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a>	Mrs du Randt, in her evidence under cross-examination she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a>agreed that she could have made a mistake regarding the date, she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a>conceded to that.  And furthermore the programme of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a>President's Council as presented by Mr Derby-Lewis, shows that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a>he was not here then, but in Cape Town and that evidence is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a>supported by Mr du Randt's testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a>	With respect I want to say under these circumstances, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a>only thing which is a fixed date, is the 10th of March.  Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a>Venter furthermore says that according to her husband, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a>Derby-Lewis asked this weapon for stock piling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   Mr Prinsloo, Mrs du Randt was cocksure that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a>the parcel was delivered at Mr Derby-Lewis' house before her </p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a>daughter's birthday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, under cross-examination she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a>conceded after I indicated to her that Mr Derby-Lewis was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a>here at that time, and she conceded that she could have made a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a>mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a>	Taken into consideration the fact that the du Randts have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a>apparently according to their evidence, regularly on a Thursday, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a>visited their daughter in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a>	And then if you look at Mr du Randt's statement to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a>Police, he said that he made this statement under difficult </p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a>circumstances.  The policeman first wrote the date as the 31st of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a>March, then they changed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a>	With respect Mr Chairman, this Committee fortunately has </p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a>the advantage of fixed dates where it could indicate to a specific </p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a>event, this could be seen from the programme and also as being </p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a>said by Mrs Venter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a>	She is a very intelligent witness and not at all - and she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a>gave clear evidence regardless in depth cross-examination by Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a>Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a>	Chairperson, then we had the evidence of Captain de Waal </p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a>regarding the statements of Mrs Derby-Lewis.  Captain de Waal </p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a>says he warned the witness according to Judge's Rules.  If you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a>look at the evidence that Colonel Van Niekerk told the witness, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a>you are going to stay here until you speak, and he is a Captain, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a>came here, and he said that he did not warn her according to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a>Judge's Rules, because it is not clear from her statement, I am not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a>a witness, but during my whole career, I have never seen that a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a>suspect makes a statement in detention, Section 29 detention, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a>I can understand if she was taken to another Officer, that she had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a>to be warned according to Judge's Rules, and then make her </p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a>statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a>	But here Mrs Derby-Lewis gave evidence that the statement </p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a>was made and that she would be used as a witness.  This is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a>supported by the fact that this was the purpose of Captain de </p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a>Waal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a>	Captain de Waal's evidence was unacceptable when he said </p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a>that Colonel Van Niekerk told him that a team, apart from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a>Security Police, would blindly question a person without knowing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a>anything about the matters of that case, things which he already </p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a>told Deetliefs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>	Taking into consideration that she had mentioned certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a>things to Deetliefs, which is available on video tapes, you can </p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a>have a look at that, and then he also said that she wrote a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a>statement in her own handwriting, and then she is told that what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a>you have just said now, according to information, is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a>	Your husband said something else.  If you have a look at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a>that and you look at her handwritten statement, volume R4, just </p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a>one minute please, specifically regarding the firearm and the list </p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a>Mr Kemp provided, if you look at the statement of Captain de </p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a>Waal in Exhibit AC page 2 where he says at the bottom regarding </p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a>things which are unclear and there are things which do not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a>coincide with her husband's statement.  In other words he knew </p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a>what Deetliefs had said and he said he did not know.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a>	Furthermore he said she stated that her husband never </p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a>indicated a firearm, while her husband during questioning did </p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a>indicate a firearm.  She went further, saying that she now </p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a>remembered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a>	If we look at the statement, her handwritten statement, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a>paragraph 66 on page 158 of the typed version, it's page 159, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a>paragraph 72:</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a>		"then that Cuba had possibly done the deed and Clive </p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a>and I later confirmed that Cuba had used the gun </p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a>which Clive showed me one day in the house (with a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a>silencer).  Clive and I then left.  We were both of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a>course shocked at the news and then we went </p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a>shopping"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a>If you look at the handwritten document at page 66, paragraph </p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a>72, you will see where it all fits in.  Not on the bottom part of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a>page, two thirds down the page.  There it's written: </p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a>		"It was obvious to me"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a>that's what is written there.  It's very clear that she had written </p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a>something else, where's that page?  There's more written on this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a>page, it's evident here that she had written more on this page.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a>is very clear that she had to re-write this and had to fit this into </p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a>this page. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a>	If you look at the time when he questioned her on the 26th </p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a>of April she had already completed her statement to fit it into </p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a>this.  If you have a look at the list - the argument regarding the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a>list, when he said that Mrs - it's paragraph 72 and not 66, I made </p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a>a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   What page?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   I think it's 186, it's not very clear on my page </p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a>as it's marked.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Paragraph 72 Mr Chairman, that's correct.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a>Thank you Mr Justice Wilson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a>	If you look at the time when these things were said on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a>26th of April according to Captain de Waal, if you look at what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a>he said about the list which is referred to just previously and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a>which was obtained from Arthur Kemp, where she asked him:</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a>		"Was Arthus Kemp taken into custody?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a>It's a continuation of these pages, and you will see that Arthur </p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a>Kemp, on the 21st of April already made his statement and there </p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a>he conceded that he had provided a list, compiled a list and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a>provided it to Mrs Derby-Lewis.  This was a known fact to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a>Captain de Waal at that stage because he himself said he arrested </p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a>him, at least he arrested Kemp.  Now to come and say that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a>then first wanted to establish certain facts, does not make any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a>sense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a>	From paragraph 66 in that same statement you see the part, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a>the handwritten part regarding Kemp matter and furthermore </p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a>reference is also made to Kemp in the other paragraphs.  Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a>Derby-Lewis testifies that Captain de Waal told her what to say.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a>If you take this fact into consideration, that none of these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a>statements made according to Section 29 formed part of the trial, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a>was never presented, on the contrary at that stage it was not a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a>legal requirement in any case that statements and a dossier be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a>made available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a>	At that time when Mrs Derby-Lewis was in custody she kept </p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a>notes and after she was released according to Section 29, she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a>specifically said what her experiences were in custody in terms of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a>Section 29.  Exhibit 1A was what she wrote and furthermore she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a>also wrote an article which appeared in the document: "Ons eie". </p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a>  In Exhibit A1 she said that she wrote hundreds of pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is it Exhibit 1A or Exhibit A1?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Y1 Mr Chairman, it starts at Y1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Y1?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That's correct Mr Chairman.  It appears at page </p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a>7 of Exhibit Y Mr Chairman, at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chairman, it's not clear according </p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a>to Captain de Waal why she's written contradictory statements.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a>Now the Committee has the problem of what was said and what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a>was not said.  The other problem is, with respect, that you should </p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a>look at what the value is of these statements taken under these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a>circumstances.  With respect, the value of these statements is to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a>cause confusion and because of that reason these cannot be used </p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a>to evaluate Mr Derby-Lewis, the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a>	It's also clear where the insertions were made </p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a>...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   ...[inaudible] on which we mustn't consider </p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a>these statements was because some of what is in that statement, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a>she claims was what she was told to say by Mr de Waal, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a>the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That's the one reason Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Are there any other reasons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, she said that she was forced, she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a>was under Section 29 and she did not want to make a statement.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a>If you look at the video recordings, it is clear that she did not act </p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a>voluntarily without legal assistance.  And also, in here detention </p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a>file it is indicated that she was ill at a certain time while de Waal </p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a>said she was fine.  She had heart problems, she received </p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a>medication.  What then with respect, is the value of a statement </p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a>made under these circumstances and ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Mr de Waal said he himself made </p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a>arrangements to take her to be seen by her own doctor, that's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a>hardly saying she was fine is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That's correct Mr Chairman.  Just a moment </p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a>please.  If you take into consideration that Mrs Derby-Lewis, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a>initially during her incarceration while she was questioned by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a>Deetliefs before she was under Section 29 but she did not have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a>legal representation, under each question she said:</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a>		"No answer, no comment."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a>after that she was under Section 29 and van Niekerk said:</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a>		"She had to talk."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a>	Mr Chairman, then I want to submit that these statements of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a>hers do not have any value for the Committee to use it against the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a>applicant because they were taken under those circumstances.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a>With respect Mr Chairman, this Committee is aware of what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a>Section 29 entailed.  Today there is evidence of how people were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a>handled to get the necessary information.  Today it's not a law </p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a>anymore and today it could even be claimed to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a>unconstitutional.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a>	There was an instance, I don't have the Judgment, where in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a>a Civil Case they wanted to present a statement in a case of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a>witness being held under Section 29 and it was argued that that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a>Section was unconstitutional and it could not be relied on because </p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a>of that.  This also makes sense in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a>	Mr Chairman, if you look at the statement taken or made by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a>Mr Derby-Lewis and under the circumstances - firstly on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a>video recording, I think it's video recording number 3, it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a>clearly indicated how Mr Derby-Lewis begged Mr Deetliefs that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a>he needed a legal representative and he said he could not make a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a>statement under those circumstances.  You could see on that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a>video recording, it speaks for itself how he acted under those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a>circumstances and Mr Derby-Lewis afterwards, how he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a>broken down and then he made a statement.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a>	What is the value then of a statement made under those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a>circumstances and furthermore where he is told:</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a>		"We are going to lock up your wife."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a>He said he was protecting his wife and that was just natural, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a>while he knew that that list which was used was a list presented </p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a>to his wife by Arthur Kemp.  That was a list from him to her and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a>that had a certain connection with his wife.  With respect, it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a>just a natural thing to protect his wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a>	In his evidence he told us how he obtained the list.  He said </p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a>he saw the list in Cape Town, he described the circumstances.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a>Doctor Hartzenberg supports the fact that documents were placed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a>on his desk by Mrs Derby-Lewis, he supports her evidence.  There </p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a>is no reason why Doctor Hartzenberg would tell a lie about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a>something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a>	And shortly Mr Chairman without using anymore of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a>time, these statements have little if no value at all, these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a>statements which were taken under Section 29.  And the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a>Committee should rely on the evidence provided by Mrs Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a>Lewis in this regard. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a>	Mr Chairman, the evidence regarding the list.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a>understand from the family that it is alleged that there was a big </p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a>conspiracy, that apart from these two applicants it's also alleged </p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a>that Mrs Derby-Lewis - and also regarding the way in which the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a>firearm was obtained - I've already referred to du Randt and Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a>Venter, Mr Venter's evidence was that Mr Derby-Lewis asked for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a>a weapon for stockpiling. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a>	With respect, under the circumstances there is no evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a>to the contrary and why would he tell Mr Venter that he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a>going to murder somebody with that weapon and then broaden a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a>conspiracy which would have been unprofessional to do, to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a>commit such a deed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a>	The same applies for Mr du Randt.  And it seems from his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a>statement made to the police, that he is innocent.  Mr Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a>Lewis could not tell him anything, he was in custody.  He could </p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a>not tell Venter because he was in custody.  Mr Venter acted on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a>his own behalf.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a>	Regarding Mr Kemp, during the trial and receiving further </p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a>particulars the State said that Mr Kemp was not a co-conspirator. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a> In the Court Judge Eloff also treated him likewise.  Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a>Chairman, this list with 19 names was faxed to Mr Kemp from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a>Mrs Derby-Lewis, it was an open fax line.  At that time, and it's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a>no secret, telephones were tapped and faxes were intercepted so </p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a>somebody would have been stupid, if it was a secret, to convey it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a>in such a manner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a>	She leaves those 19 names on her computer and the police </p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a>had access to that computer.  She knew then that on the 12th of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a>April that list would become involved and that would be damning </p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a>evidence.  If she - why would she then leave that list on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a>computer, Mr Walus had already been arrested and there was a lot </p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a>of fuss in the media?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a>	Honourable Chairman, Mrs Derby-Lewis was found innocent </p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a>during the trial, why would she now here, she has no reason now </p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a>to come and say: "I was not a co-conspirator", there's nothing for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a>her to lose.  If she comes here and says she was a co-conspirator </p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a>she could have made an amnesty application, she knew her </p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a>husband was applying for amnesty for perjury or anything like </p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a>that.  She does not apply for amnesty because she believes she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a>was not a co-conspirator.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a>	If you look at these statements written by the police, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a>want to involve her, those parts which were put in.   And in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a>end it looks as if for the police that later on she could have heard </p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a>about these things but she did not know it in the planning stages </p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a>while planning an assassination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a>	With respect Mr Chairman, Arthur Kemp was the author of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a>this list, he is the person who decided about this list.  That was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a>his evidence in the Supreme Court,  he compiled this list, she had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a>no control over that.  And right from the beginning she said she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a>required that list in order to obtain information to write certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a>things in the Patriot and a lot has been said about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a>	With respect, look at the list itself.  Should it be a murder </p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a>list one would have expected that there would have been full </p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a>particulars.  For example regarding Mr Chris Hani, all you find </p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a>there is an address that says nothing, it's insignificant.  It can't be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a>regarded as a murder list.  ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Why are there ...[No English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   I will refer to the indications made next to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a>other names.  Mr Chairman, apart from these two people, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a>Mandela and the late Mr Joe Slovo, the other person - the only </p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a>person where there - these are the only persons where there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a>descriptions of their houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a>	In the newspapers Mr Mandela's house was described.  This </p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a>was the same information contained on this list and the same is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a>applicable to Mr Joe Slovo.  On itself this was a public fact or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a>public knowledge.  If you take into consideration the wider public </p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a>which read various newspapers, they knew the descriptions of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a>those houses because we found it in the newspapers.  He obtained </p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a>that information from a newspaper.  That was also according to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a>his statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a>	With respect, those descriptions regarding certain security </p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a>measures or not cannot be ascribed to the applicants.  This was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a>absolutely Mr Kemp's decision and here is no suggestion that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a>Kemp under the circumstances, was a co-conspirator or anyhow </p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a>involved in committing this crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a>	As far as it concerns Mr Kemp, we've tried to get him here </p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a>and we've already placed it on record but it was out of our </p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a>control.  Should you deem it necessary we have to make another </p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a>plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   You have argued that - you have made certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a>submissions in relation to statements by Mrs Derby-Lewis but you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a>do appreciate that should we accept some of the things she says </p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a>in her statement it could very well mean that she was aware of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a>plan and that in turn would mean that the applicants did not tell </p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a>this to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, Judge Ngoepe, do you mean </p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a>after the time or before the time?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That she knew beforehand or afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Before the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Some of the things she says in her statement </p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a>indicates she had foreknowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That a plan was being made that there would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a>be an assassination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, her evidence is that it was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a>like that.  The applicants said it was not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   I'm saying that what stands in some of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a>things which she says in her statement.  She says she had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a>knowledge of that before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   In her evidence she denied that she any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a>knowledge but with respect, this refers to my argument </p>

<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Yes, yes, I appreciate that, that's why I put it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a>on the hypothetical basis, that assuming we accept, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a>notwithstanding your submissions, if we were to accept that she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a>did say what stands in her statements, some of the things would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a>indicate that she had foreknowledge.  And the implications </p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a>thereof would be that the applicants did not make a full </p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a>disclosure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman with respect, according to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a>statements, if I understand you correctly, that she had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a>foreknowledge of this and not that she was a co-conspirator, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a>she had foreknowledge about this, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a>Mr Chairman, in which aspect would ...[indistinct] did she get </p>

<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a>that would be a different factor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   With their knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With their knowledge, for example when she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a>said:</p>

<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a>while the statement said:</p>

<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Can you also see where she says:</p>

<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a>eliminated because of his particular brutal record" </p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a>and so on and so forth and then she goes down to say that:</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a>		"This does not mean to say that discussions between </p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a>the two of them were not going on.  Clive told me </p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a>sometime in March that he and Cuba had decided </p>

<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a>You see, that indicates foreknowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Yes, it indicates that they had told her that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a>there was a plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   If we were to accept that that is in fact what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a>she said, it would mean that the applicants did not make a full </p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a>disclosure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   In this aspect it would be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   With regard to Mrs Derby-Lewis' knowledge </p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a>to the whole thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That would be correct if it would be accepted </p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a>like that.  I want to refer you Mr Chairman, to this part:</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a>		"Clive and Cuba decided on Chris Hani to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a>eliminated because of his particularly brutal record </p>

<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a>to the last portion I read to you, it will not hold.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   This is the problem we have with this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a>statement, these parts which have been inserted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   No, well, I don't know what you mean but </p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a>what I'm saying to you is that the point that you are trying to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a>raise will definitely assist you with regard to the last portion I </p>

<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   That one stands firm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Yes, that is so on that basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a>	Just one moment please.  With respect, I want to argue that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a>Arthur, there's no indication that he is a co-conspirator and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a>aspect I've referred to regarding Mr Derby-Lewis, I've already </p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a>referred to in my argument regarding her statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a>	Then to come back to Mr Derby-Lewis himself.  With </p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a>respect, I want to argue that if you look at the facts which are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a>fixed in this matter, there was for example, a plan to eliminate Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a>Hani.  A decision was made, a firearm was obtained, a firearm </p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a>was used for this purpose by Mr Walus.  Mr Walus executed this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a>with Mr Derby-Lewis' approval and knowledge and on instruction </p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a>from him for the purpose as indicated.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a>	There was no discussion at all of how the weapon was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a>obtained, how it was given to Mr Walus.  It is supported by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a>evidence in the Supreme Court as well, that the person who </p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a>worked in the house saw this.  We should look at the fixed facts </p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a>of this case, taking into consideration that Mr Derby-Lewis was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a>interrogated or cross-examined for days by Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a>	I argue that he made a full disclosure in as far as his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a>involvement and the reason why he committed this.  His whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a>activities or actions refer to this.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a>	A further aspect is that it should be into consideration that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a>Mr Derby-Lewis was initially responsible for his application and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a>he had very little real representation.  As statements are made it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a>could be inaccurate.  And he was politician who compiled this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a>when he made this application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I don't regard the fact that he was a politician </p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a>in any way as a handicap, do you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Mr Chairman, they have a tendency to write a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a>lot and to talk a lot.  I'm saying it with respect, I don't mean </p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a>anything strange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a>	Then I want to refer to when this conspiracy developed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a>Evidence was given by Mrs Beyers who said that she and saw Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a>Walus in July 1992, he was sitting outside Mr Mandela's house.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a>Mr Chairman, if Mrs Beyers' evidence was to be accepted as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a>correct then this murder list is not necessary because Mr Walus in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a>1992 already knew where he was living, it was not necessary for a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a>murder list.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a>	If Mrs Derby-Lewis was to be involved, if she knew about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a>the conspiracy that then she had to put Doctor Mandela's name on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a>that list.  That was unnecessary if that evidence is accepted as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a>true.  Mrs Beyers with respect, if you look at her evidence and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a>look at what she said, she say can't say in which newspaper she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a>saw Mr Walus, from which point this - from which angle this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a>photograph was taken, the time frame when it happened, why she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a>did not go to the police with this information and under which </p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a>circumstances she went to the police with this, except that she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a>remembered that she conveyed it to Mr Mandela during a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a>function.  	With respect Mr Chairman, if there was a bakkie like </p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a>that, she made a wrong identification.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a>	If the Committee would accept this then it would support </p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a>the versions of the applicants, that they did not have the murder </p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a>list.  And then it would also support Mrs Derby-Lewis' version, if </p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a>she had already known where Doctor Mandela was living and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a>further details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a>	Honourable Chairperson, while I am dealing with Mr Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a>Lewis, there is also the testimony of the Mr Clark which cause </p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a>quite a stir, which suggested that there was a plan that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a>would pay the defence Mr Derby-Lewis.  With respect, those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a>allegations cannot be true and any possibility that it could be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a>true.  With regard to this I would like to contend that he was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a>very open witness who was cross-examined by Mr Bizos </p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a>...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Just hold it there.  When you describe him in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a>the way that you are describing him, I'm not necessarily saying </p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a>that there is evidence or there is no evidence of wider conspiracy </p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a>but when you begin to describe to Mr Clark that way as a witness, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a>I think I would have some problem because you see I think Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a>Clark did not make any attempt to hide the fact the he was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a>impartial, he was not to be impartial in this case.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a>	He has demonstrated that and he indicated that he would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a>not be coming here before us - if we wanted him, to he would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a>only do at the instance of the applicants and I'm not so sure how </p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a>helpful that kind of evidence is.  And another thing is, well, as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a>I've said to you it indicates some partiality of sorts, some </p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a>partiality.  It could indicate some partiality.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a>	And anther thing is, it's all very well for a witness to come </p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a>and say: "Well these proceedings are part of a circus and the like, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a>it is his right to say so.   But when I have to come to a point </p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a>where I must consider the credibility of such a witness, I have got </p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a>to ask myself whether a witness who adopts that kind of attitude </p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a>in giving evidence could be prompted, let alone feeling obliged in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a>telling the truth and being honest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chair with respect, as far as his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a>attitude is concerned, whether or not he wanted to testify and his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a>reasons for not appearing, that would involve his attitude.  But </p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a>respect, regarding his factual evidence I would like to argue that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a>his factual evidence in indisputable and Mr Bizos with respect, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a>cross-examined him thoroughly and there is no aspect in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a>evidence which would indicate partiality.  He said that there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a>even possibility for negotiation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   On this aspect of impartiality or partiality, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a>are you saying that he was the kind of witness who would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a>been prepared to say or concede anything even if that thing would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a>have been prejudicial to the applicant's case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, he said very plainly that he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a>information on his computer which did not belong there, as an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a>example ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   So you are saying he is the kind of witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a>who would have been - who was so impartial that he would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a>been in a position to say or concede anything even if that thing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a>would have been prejudicial to the applicant's case?  Can he be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a>described to be that kind of witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   I would argue that it would be so and that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a>did appear so.  I regarded him as a very good witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Did he regard these proceedings as a serious </p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a>exercise or as a platform where you could just come and say what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a>you want to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect Honourable Chair, he appeared to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a>be a person who had certain complaints or reservations.  There </p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a>are people in the media who have the same type of complaints but </p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a>nonetheless he appeared here and testified open-heartedly without </p>
<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a>knowing what they would ask him, apart from the Visser issue. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a>	And Mr Bizos' cross-examination went much further than </p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a>that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   But ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   He's the first witness that I can recollect, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a>who arrived here on his own with documents he wanted to hand </p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a>in, with prepared speeches he wanted to make, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   That's not surprising because he had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a>consulted with and he was asked and he had agreed to comply </p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a>with the requests of applicant's counsel.  He had prepared himself </p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a>to come and give that evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   If he - during the trial at Pretoria he knew that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a>he would be called in, it's generally known and at no stage did we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a>have any reason to consult him and he was not consulted with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   He might have told the truth at the end of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a>day but would it be unreasonable of a trier of facts in determining </p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a>his credibility to take into account the points that I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a>mentioned to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect Honourable Chair, the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a>decision can be delivered regarding Mr Kronen.  He testified for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a>the Communist party.  Not once did Mrs Beyers ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   The points that I mentioned to you had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a>nothing to do with the documents.  I told you that his attitude, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a>has a certain perception about these proceedings and I said </p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a>specifically to you that: under those circumstances, one should </p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a>ask oneself the questions: "This kind of witness, could he have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a>felt prompted or obliged to tell the truth and be open and frank to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a>what he says is part of a circus".  No witness is tainted with that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a>kind of question mark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   Honourable Chair with respect, with such an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a>attitude he could not have arrived here with the purpose to place </p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a>the applicants at an advantage.  If he had come forward with that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a>purpose in mind, he would not have adopted that attitude and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a>would have then have been partial in his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   My question pertinently to you was, do you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a>think it as unreasonable for a trier of facts in determining the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a>credibility of such a witness, to take those things into account, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a>would you or would you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, it should not be viewed in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a>isolation but be seen in terms of his testimony as an entirety and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1713"><a name="pos1713"></a>then be judged but one should not look at singular aspects.   I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1714"><a name="pos1714"></a>would like to maintain that his entire testimony should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1715"><a name="pos1715"></a>weighed up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1716"><a name="pos1716"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it became quite clear that he had very </p>
<p class="line" id="line1717"><a name="pos1717"></a>strong views on his political beliefs.  He had strong views of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1718"><a name="pos1718"></a>Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  He did not think it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1719"><a name="pos1719"></a>necessary to hide or conceal his views about that.  He felt very, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1720"><a name="pos1720"></a>very strongly in favour of Mr Derby-Lewis and Mrs Derby-Lewis </p>
<p class="line" id="line1721"><a name="pos1721"></a>and his commitment to the cause of Mr Derby-Lewis became quite </p>
<p class="line" id="line1722"><a name="pos1722"></a>clear in his evidence.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1723"><a name="pos1723"></a>	What is being asked by my learned friend here, my brother </p>
<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a>here, is that quite clearly, can this witness be described as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a>impartial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   With respect, in terms of his evidence there is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a>nothing which indicates to the contradictory, that he was partial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a>MR PRINSLOO:   ...[No English translation] apart from the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a>that funds would be applied for the defence of Mr Derby-Lewis.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a>When were the Freedom Front and the Volksfront established, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1732"><a name="pos1732"></a>when was the money stolen.  Look at the facts surrounding the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1733"><a name="pos1733"></a>issue.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1734"><a name="pos1734"></a>	There's nothing in his testimony which indicates facts which </p>
<p class="line" id="line1735"><a name="pos1735"></a>can be used in this relation and I am surprised that he was needed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1736"><a name="pos1736"></a>as a witness.  His testimony was anything but satisfactory and it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1737"><a name="pos1737"></a>contributed absolutely nothing to the case.  Just a moment please. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1738"><a name="pos1738"></a>	Honourable Chairperson, another aspect which should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1739"><a name="pos1739"></a>studied closely is the time period when this deed was committed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1740"><a name="pos1740"></a>I would like to argue that this deed was committed at a time when </p>
<p class="line" id="line1741"><a name="pos1741"></a>there was definite conflict and a struggle between various groups </p>
<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a>and parties and it cannot be argued that peace prevailed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1743"><a name="pos1743"></a>	I would like argue with respect, that no possibility existed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a>other than to accept as a fact that there would be a takeover by</p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a>the ANC/SACP Alliance at that point and that under those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a>circumstances it would have been beneficial for the party to which </p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a>Mr Derby-Lewis belonged.  And under the circumstances, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a>Derby-Lewis fulfilled all the requirements regarding this Act and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a>if amnesty would be granted to Mr Derby-Lewis, reconciliation </p>
<p class="line" id="line1750"><a name="pos1750"></a>would be further promoted in this country.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1751"><a name="pos1751"></a>	I would argue with respect, there is nothing which Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1752"><a name="pos1752"></a>Derby-Lewis at this point, which indicates that he would not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1753"><a name="pos1753"></a>promote reconciliation, he is no longer involved in politics.  At </p>
<p class="line" id="line1754"><a name="pos1754"></a>this point in this country the CP is promoted to negotiations.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1755"><a name="pos1755"></a>And at this point with respect, no violence is being committed by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1756"><a name="pos1756"></a>members of the CP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1757"><a name="pos1757"></a>	And in that respect, with respect Mr Chairperson, especially </p>
<p class="line" id="line1758"><a name="pos1758"></a>where various people particularly white males in this country are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1759"><a name="pos1759"></a>feeling neglected yet they are well treated otherwise to take a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a>place in society, that is the endeavour of Mr Derby-Lewis.  There </p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a>is no violence on his behalf, no violence in mind.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1762"><a name="pos1762"></a>	And I argue with respect, that amnesty be granted to him </p>
<p class="line" id="line1763"><a name="pos1763"></a>and that this will help to promote and establish reconciliation </p>
<p class="line" id="line1764"><a name="pos1764"></a>within this country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1765"><a name="pos1765"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1766"><a name="pos1766"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Can I let you have the 1995 amendment to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1767"><a name="pos1767"></a>Act, Section 9.  I don't know if there has been a subsequent </p>
<p class="line" id="line1768"><a name="pos1768"></a>amendment ...[no sound]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1769"><a name="pos1769"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Mrs van der Walt?  Yes Mrs van der Walt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1770"><a name="pos1770"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT IN ARGUMENT:   Thank you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1771"><a name="pos1771"></a>Chairperson.  I will attempt not to repeat what Mr Prinsloo has </p>
<p class="line" id="line1772"><a name="pos1772"></a>stated.  There are certain aspects which I wish to highlight in my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1773"><a name="pos1773"></a>argument.  Firstly it is the applicant who in terms of Section </p>

<p class="line" id="line1775"><a name="pos1775"></a>which is read together with question IV.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line1776"><a name="pos1776"></a>	The applicant was honest towards the Committee by saying </p>
<p class="line" id="line1777"><a name="pos1777"></a>that he compiled his application with the assistance of Mr Clive </p>
<p class="line" id="line1778"><a name="pos1778"></a>Derby-Lewis and that also in paragraph 11(b) he did not state </p>
<p class="line" id="line1779"><a name="pos1779"></a>that he had received an order.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1780"><a name="pos1780"></a>	I would like to put it to the Honourable Committee that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1781"><a name="pos1781"></a>Committee should accept his testimony in that regard, that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1782"><a name="pos1782"></a>indeed did attempt to make the burden or the issue lighter for Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1783"><a name="pos1783"></a>Clive Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1784"><a name="pos1784"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Was he not aware of the danger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1785"><a name="pos1785"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Yes, he was aware of the danger, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line1786"><a name="pos1786"></a>only after he had been consulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1787"><a name="pos1787"></a>ADV POTGIETER:  ...[inaudible]</p>

<p class="line" id="line1790"><a name="pos1790"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Didn't he know that he should submit the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1791"><a name="pos1791"></a>entire truth to the Commission with his application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1792"><a name="pos1792"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Yes, he did know that he must make a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1793"><a name="pos1793"></a>full disclosure but as he has stated, in his testimony he attempted </p>
<p class="line" id="line1794"><a name="pos1794"></a>- he did make a full disclosure but when he had to speak of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1795"><a name="pos1795"></a>order he didn't specifically mention it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1796"><a name="pos1796"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   So, in other words he told a lie in his initial </p>
<p class="line" id="line1797"><a name="pos1797"></a>application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1798"><a name="pos1798"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Not, a lie as such but he did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1799"><a name="pos1799"></a>express it as strongly I would like to argue.  But on the 30th of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1800"><a name="pos1800"></a>November 1996, he did indeed say that he received an order and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a>they had planned it together but that he himself had acted alone in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a>committing the deed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a>	Then my heads proceed ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   I beg your pardon Madam, did he do this in </p>

<p class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a>addition to my application the following particulars </p>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a>are provided"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a>Is that what you're referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1817"><a name="pos1817"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1819"><a name="pos1819"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Then I would like to deal with Section </p>
<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a>22(a) which I would present to the Committee.  This is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a>section which reads that the offence for which the applicant is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a>applying should be a deed which is related a political objective.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a>	I would like to present to the Honourable Committee that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a>the applicant was a member of the Conservative Party.  It is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a>argued that after the deed the Conservative Party apparently said </p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a>in the media that he was not a member of the Conservative Party. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a> I would like to argue to you that that indeed was his testimony.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a>Mr Hartzenberg testified and he made no mention that he was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a>a member of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a>	The applicant presented his background, his birth in Poland </p>
<p class="line" id="line1831"><a name="pos1831"></a>to the Committee and his experience of the Communist Party.   I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1832"><a name="pos1832"></a>would like to present to the Committee that his background in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a>Poland and his experience of the Communist Party was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a>presented to the Committee in order to say that he had developed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a>a hatred towards Communists on that basis and that is why the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a>deed was committed, but if one studies his testimony it is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a>indicated in any other way.  He did this in order to say to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a>Committee that he knew what would happen if the country would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a>be ruled by a communist dispensation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a>	The applicant immigrated to South Africa and because he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a>came to South Africa he became involved in politics, although at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a>that stage he was not a citizen of our country and could not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1843"><a name="pos1843"></a>participate in elections.  From the initial stages he realised that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1844"><a name="pos1844"></a>changes were taking place in the country and he became closely </p>
<p class="line" id="line1845"><a name="pos1845"></a>involved with the Conservative Party's breaking away.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1846"><a name="pos1846"></a>	At that point he was quite aware of South African politics </p>
<p class="line" id="line1847"><a name="pos1847"></a>and he realised, as it is set out, that the policy which prevailed at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1848"><a name="pos1848"></a>that point was about change and that there might be a possible </p>
<p class="line" id="line1849"><a name="pos1849"></a>communist dispensation in government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1850"><a name="pos1850"></a>	He met Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis during 1995 and became </p>
<p class="line" id="line1851"><a name="pos1851"></a>further involved in politics and assisted the Conservative Party </p>
<p class="line" id="line1852"><a name="pos1852"></a>with elections and by-elections.  And after he was granted </p>
<p class="line" id="line1853"><a name="pos1853"></a>citizenship in 1988, before that time in 1985 he also became a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1854"><a name="pos1854"></a>member of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging and when he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1855"><a name="pos1855"></a>granted citizenship in 1989 he participated in his first election in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1856"><a name="pos1856"></a>South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1857"><a name="pos1857"></a>	He also testified that he realised in 1990, when the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1858"><a name="pos1858"></a>ANC/SACP was legalised, that there was a definite problem which </p>
<p class="line" id="line1859"><a name="pos1859"></a>was developing in South Africa and he believed that there would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1860"><a name="pos1860"></a>be  an ANC/SACP rule in the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1861"><a name="pos1861"></a>	He was also present when Dr Andries Treurnicht delivered a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1862"><a name="pos1862"></a>speech at the Voortrekker Monument in May 1990 where the third </p>
<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a>struggle for freedom was mentioned.  And he testified that during </p>
<p class="line" id="line1864"><a name="pos1864"></a>that meeting Dr Andries Treurnicht swept or called the masses of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1865"><a name="pos1865"></a>people who attended the meeting, called them to battle.  And </p>
<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a>after that he attended negotiations where the Conservative Party </p>
<p class="line" id="line1867"><a name="pos1867"></a>decided that they should ready themselves for a possible war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1868"><a name="pos1868"></a>	In 1992 he was also further involved, and he testified </p>
<p class="line" id="line1869"><a name="pos1869"></a>regarding that, he was involved in the referendum which was to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1870"><a name="pos1870"></a>take place and it was decided afterwards that the democratic road </p>
<p class="line" id="line1871"><a name="pos1871"></a>was most definitely for the Afrikaner, as definitely closed for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1872"><a name="pos1872"></a>Afrikaner nation of which he regarded himself to be a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1873"><a name="pos1873"></a>	The applicant who was involved in politics as I have just </p>
<p class="line" id="line1874"><a name="pos1874"></a>argued, was more involved with the second applicant, Mr Clive </p>
<p class="line" id="line1875"><a name="pos1875"></a>Derby-Lewis, and his politics. What appears very strongly within </p>
<p class="line" id="line1876"><a name="pos1876"></a>his testimony is that he as an immigrant from Poland.  He came to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1877"><a name="pos1877"></a>be under the influence of Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, that he regarded </p>
<p class="line" id="line1878"><a name="pos1878"></a>him as a political leader and not just a politician and he also </p>
<p class="line" id="line1879"><a name="pos1879"></a>regarded him as one of the policy makers of the Conservative </p>
<p class="line" id="line1880"><a name="pos1880"></a>Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1881"><a name="pos1881"></a>	After the referendum in 1992 it was very clear to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1882"><a name="pos1882"></a>applicant that the CP and the other right-wing groups - and I wish </p>
<p class="line" id="line1883"><a name="pos1883"></a> to argue that it should be considered that he was also involved in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1884"><a name="pos1884"></a>AWB meetings.  AWB was one of the right-wing groups and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1885"><a name="pos1885"></a>AWB was not and is not a political party.  The members of the CP </p>
<p class="line" id="line1886"><a name="pos1886"></a>belonged to the CP as a political party and to the AWB as a right-</p>
<p class="line" id="line1887"><a name="pos1887"></a>wing organisation.  It is not to say that the members of the AWB </p>
<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a>could not have been Conservative Party members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1889"><a name="pos1889"></a>	Dr Ferdie Hartzenberg testified - and I'm still dealing with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1890"><a name="pos1890"></a>this under the fact that this offence occurred within a political </p>
<p class="line" id="line1891"><a name="pos1891"></a>struggle as Section 22(a) determines, Dr Ferdie Hartzenburg </p>
<p class="line" id="line1892"><a name="pos1892"></a>testified that it was not the policy of the CP, the written policy </p>
<p class="line" id="line1893"><a name="pos1893"></a>which they as a political party expressed or carried out.  Violence </p>
<p class="line" id="line1894"><a name="pos1894"></a>was not their policy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a>	However Dr Ferdie Hartzenberg's testimony must be seen </p>
<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a>very thoroughly as an entirety.  He testified that during </p>
<p class="line" id="line1897"><a name="pos1897"></a>August/September 1992, after the signing of the Record of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1898"><a name="pos1898"></a>Understanding that was between the National Party and the ANC, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1899"><a name="pos1899"></a>the CP realised that it was now involved in a political struggle. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1900"><a name="pos1900"></a>	Up until that point the CP had achieved quite a level of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a>support in politics.  They won a number of by-elections and it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a>became very clear that the Conservative Party which at that point </p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a>had already become the opposition, if there were to be a general </p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a>election the voters - that would be before it was an open election </p>
<p class="line" id="line1905"><a name="pos1905"></a>for all population groups, the CP realised that it might able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a>defeat the National Party.  But with the undersigning of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1907"><a name="pos1907"></a>Record of Understanding the CP realised, and this was made clear </p>
<p class="line" id="line1908"><a name="pos1908"></a>from every platform from their supporters, that now there was an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1909"><a name="pos1909"></a>overwhelming struggle and that the Afrikaner nation's freedom </p>
<p class="line" id="line1910"><a name="pos1910"></a>was in danger because if the ANC/SACP Alliance came into </p>
<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a>power, the Afrikaner nation would lose it's freedom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a>	And the policy - this is his testimony, the CP's policy was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a>to strive for the freedom of the Afrikaner nation and it did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a>change since the establishment of the Conservative Party.  Now </p>
<p class="line" id="line1915"><a name="pos1915"></a>with the signing of the Record of Understanding, this freedom of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1916"><a name="pos1916"></a>the Afrikaner was put in danger and that is how the CP regarded </p>
<p class="line" id="line1917"><a name="pos1917"></a>it and it was also expressed as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1918"><a name="pos1918"></a>	He also testified that it was very clear to the Conservative </p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a>Party that the ANC and especially the SACP under the leadership </p>
<p class="line" id="line1920"><a name="pos1920"></a>of Mr Chris Hani would not grant the Afrikaner nation it's own </p>
<p class="line" id="line1921"><a name="pos1921"></a>territory, they wanted a unity state.  And he also testified about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1922"><a name="pos1922"></a>an army which Mr Hani had ready, with 10 000 troops if the vote </p>
<p class="line" id="line1923"><a name="pos1923"></a>did not swing in favour of the ANC and the negotiations for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1924"><a name="pos1924"></a>unity state would be enforced with violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1925"><a name="pos1925"></a>	The testimony of Dr Hartzenberg continued and said that as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1926"><a name="pos1926"></a>a result of this political struggle which existed or ruled the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1927"><a name="pos1927"></a>country at that point - it cannot be seen as anything else, the CP </p>
<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a>decided to mobilise in all areas, not only religiously or in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1929"><a name="pos1929"></a>educational sphere, on all levels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1930"><a name="pos1930"></a>	The CP mobilised to resist the ANC/SACP Alliance in terms </p>
<p class="line" id="line1931"><a name="pos1931"></a>of the threat towards the Afrikaner nation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   When ...[inaudible] in the sense that </p>

<p class="line" id="line1937"><a name="pos1937"></a>If you look at page 755 of the record he says there:</p>
<p class="line" id="line1938"><a name="pos1938"></a>		"In the course of 1992 we realised that because those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1939"><a name="pos1939"></a>opinions were diminishing we would have to mobilise </p>
<p class="line" id="line1940"><a name="pos1940"></a>our people to demonstrate in a visible manner that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1941"><a name="pos1941"></a>were quite serious for the preservation of our liberty"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1942"><a name="pos1942"></a>and he goes on over the next page to say that:</p>
<p class="line" id="line1943"><a name="pos1943"></a>		"We would have 18 interest groups including </p>
<p class="line" id="line1944"><a name="pos1944"></a>education, agriculture, local government etc., and </p>

<p class="line" id="line1946"><a name="pos1946"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   That is correct, I agree with you.  But </p>
<p class="line" id="line1947"><a name="pos1947"></a>it goes further than this:</p>

<p class="line" id="line1950"><a name="pos1950"></a>to fight with weapons"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1951"><a name="pos1951"></a>His evidence goes further in saying that the leaders - and he's not </p>

<p class="line" id="line1953"><a name="pos1953"></a>leaders and he refers to the other speakers from the platform, </p>

<p class="line" id="line1963"><a name="pos1963"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Pages 772 to 774 he makes statements </p>

<p class="line" id="line1965"><a name="pos1965"></a>strongly worded things were said to convince  people to commit </p>
<p class="line" id="line1966"><a name="pos1966"></a>acts of violence.  The CP regarded the situation in the country as </p>

<p class="line" id="line1968"><a name="pos1968"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   In one word, what was the policy of the CP </p>
<p class="line" id="line1969"><a name="pos1969"></a>regarding violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1970"><a name="pos1970"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   It's the same problem that Advocate </p>
<p class="line" id="line1971"><a name="pos1971"></a>Prinsloo had.  The CP's written policy was not about violence but </p>
<p class="line" id="line1972"><a name="pos1972"></a>what they talk about, what they proclaimed from platforms at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1973"><a name="pos1973"></a>Paardekraal, at the Voortrekker monument, there they said:</p>
<p class="line" id="line1974"><a name="pos1974"></a>		"We should fight"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1975"><a name="pos1975"></a>and what else should the members of the CP and the right-wing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1976"><a name="pos1976"></a>have thought if their leaders tell them: "You have to begin the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1977"><a name="pos1977"></a>struggle and you have to fight for your freedom".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1978"><a name="pos1978"></a>ADV POTGIETER:  I understand that, that is a different </p>
<p class="line" id="line1979"><a name="pos1979"></a>argument.  According to your submission, what should we find </p>
<p class="line" id="line1980"><a name="pos1980"></a>regarding the policy of the CP regarding violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1981"><a name="pos1981"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Mr Chairman, the policy was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1982"><a name="pos1982"></a>violence but in respect of the application, and if you look at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1983"><a name="pos1983"></a>section 22(a) this is not about what the police was but it was also </p>
<p class="line" id="line1984"><a name="pos1984"></a>not the National Party's policy but it was about a political </p>
<p class="line" id="line1985"><a name="pos1985"></a>struggle and that was what the leaders of the Conservative Party </p>
<p class="line" id="line1986"><a name="pos1986"></a>said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1987"><a name="pos1987"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But you said the policy was not violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1988"><a name="pos1988"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   ...[No English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1989"><a name="pos1989"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   That helps.	</p>
<p class="line" id="line1990"><a name="pos1990"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Dr Hartzenberg gave evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line1991"><a name="pos1991"></a>regarding the question: "What was the CP's view regarding Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1992"><a name="pos1992"></a>Hani"?  I've already indicated to you that he said that Mr Hani </p>
<p class="line" id="line1993"><a name="pos1993"></a>was regarded as enemy number one of the Afrikaner people and if </p>
<p class="line" id="line1994"><a name="pos1994"></a>Hani should be in control of the country the Afrikaner people </p>
<p class="line" id="line1995"><a name="pos1995"></a>would be destroyed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1996"><a name="pos1996"></a>	And then I want to come back to what Mr Potgieter has </p>
<p class="line" id="line1997"><a name="pos1997"></a>said.  The policy of the Conservative Party was to ensure the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1998"><a name="pos1998"></a>freedom of the Afrikaner people and if Mr Hani, if he was in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1999"><a name="pos1999"></a>control of the country, then the Conservative Party believed that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2000"><a name="pos2000"></a>the Afrikaner people's liberty would be destroyed.  Then, as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2001"><a name="pos2001"></a>result of that point of view of the CP and the right-right, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2002"><a name="pos2002"></a>right-wing together with the CP because they were part of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2003"><a name="pos2003"></a>CP, then they became involved in a political struggle and then </p>
<p class="line" id="line2004"><a name="pos2004"></a>they propagated violence. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2005"><a name="pos2005"></a>	The Conservative Party and Mr Hartzenberg cannot get </p>
<p class="line" id="line2006"><a name="pos2006"></a>away from that fact.  Their followers heard about violence and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2007"><a name="pos2007"></a>that they had to use to protect their liberty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2008"><a name="pos2008"></a>	It was also clear from his evidence that the political </p>
<p class="line" id="line2009"><a name="pos2009"></a>struggle was, and he said: "The National Party betrayed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2010"><a name="pos2010"></a>Afrikaner people and the struggle after the legalisation of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2011"><a name="pos2011"></a>ANC/SACP and the struggle was then against those </p>
<p class="line" id="line2012"><a name="pos2012"></a>organisations".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2013"><a name="pos2013"></a>	Mr Chairman, in my heads I also referred to 22(d) and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2014"><a name="pos2014"></a>want to submit that in order to qualify for amnesty, the applicant </p>
<p class="line" id="line2015"><a name="pos2015"></a>he had to make full disclosure of the offence and according to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2016"><a name="pos2016"></a>which - this article, he is applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2017"><a name="pos2017"></a>	A lot has been said about the fact that there was wider </p>
<p class="line" id="line2018"><a name="pos2018"></a>conspiracy than only that between these two applicants and then </p>
<p class="line" id="line2019"><a name="pos2019"></a>because of the application there was not full disclosure.  I want </p>
<p class="line" id="line2020"><a name="pos2020"></a>to put it to you that the applicant's evidence indicates that at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2021"><a name="pos2021"></a>end of 1992  he was in Europe and after his return in December </p>
<p class="line" id="line2022"><a name="pos2022"></a>1992 he made contact with Mr Clive Derby-Lewis.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2023"><a name="pos2023"></a>	Before he had left for Europe this struggle in the country </p>
<p class="line" id="line2024"><a name="pos2024"></a>was already going on and when he returned in December this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2025"><a name="pos2025"></a>political situation in the country was discussed further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2026"><a name="pos2026"></a>	His evidence is, and there's no other evidence contradicting </p>
<p class="line" id="line2027"><a name="pos2027"></a>that, that at that stage the political situation in the country was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2028"><a name="pos2028"></a>discussed and not at any stage that they then decided that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2029"><a name="pos2029"></a>anybody had to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2030"><a name="pos2030"></a>	In February 1993, the applicants visited Mr Clive Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line2031"><a name="pos2031"></a>Lewis again and then received the instruction and the planning </p>
<p class="line" id="line2032"><a name="pos2032"></a>was made to murder Mr Hani.  It is evident from the first </p>
<p class="line" id="line2033"><a name="pos2033"></a>applicant's evidence that Mr Derby-Lewis provided a list to him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2034"><a name="pos2034"></a> I want to argue that should the Committee find that Mrs Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line2035"><a name="pos2035"></a>Lewis, based on her statements based on Section 29, as Ngoepe </p>
<p class="line" id="line2036"><a name="pos2036"></a>pointed out to Mr Prinsloo, if the Committee finds that Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line2037"><a name="pos2037"></a>Derby-Lewis knew beforehand that there was planning being done </p>
<p class="line" id="line2038"><a name="pos2038"></a>to murder Mr Hani, I want to submit that the applicant, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2039"><a name="pos2039"></a>Walus, had no knowledge of this whatsoever.   He did not know </p>
<p class="line" id="line2040"><a name="pos2040"></a>that which Mrs Derby-Lewis knew, there is no indication.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2041"><a name="pos2041"></a>	Even in the Section 29 statements or any other evidence, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2042"><a name="pos2042"></a>there is any indication that Mr Walus knew that Mrs Derby-Lewis </p>
<p class="line" id="line2043"><a name="pos2043"></a>knew what her husband - Mr Walus did not have any knowledge </p>
<p class="line" id="line2044"><a name="pos2044"></a>that he discussed it with her.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2045"><a name="pos2045"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   She did not implicate him? [Transcriber's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2046"><a name="pos2046"></a>translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line2047"><a name="pos2047"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   She did not implicate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2048"><a name="pos2048"></a>	And then I want to go further.  This list, according to Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2049"><a name="pos2049"></a>Walus, he received this list in February, that was the first time he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2050"><a name="pos2050"></a>saw that.  He has no knowledge whatsoever or he had no </p>
<p class="line" id="line2051"><a name="pos2051"></a>knowledge at that stage of how that list was obtained, he had no </p>
<p class="line" id="line2052"><a name="pos2052"></a>knowledge of this list with the 19 names which was dispatched by </p>
<p class="line" id="line2053"><a name="pos2053"></a>Mr Kemp.  He did not know how Mrs Derby-Lewis obtained the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2054"><a name="pos2054"></a>list with the 19 names.  He received the list from Mr Derby-Lewis </p>
<p class="line" id="line2055"><a name="pos2055"></a>and on Mr Derby-Lewis' instruction the list was prioritised, based </p>
<p class="line" id="line2056"><a name="pos2056"></a>on the basis of hostility against the CP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2057"><a name="pos2057"></a>	Mr Walus said that some of the names were known to him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2058"><a name="pos2058"></a>for example, Mandela and Slovo but the other people were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2059"><a name="pos2059"></a>unknown to him.  He heard about them but he did not know </p>
<p class="line" id="line2060"><a name="pos2060"></a>anything about them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2061"><a name="pos2061"></a>	Mr Walus gave evidence that during February, after this list </p>
<p class="line" id="line2062"><a name="pos2062"></a>had been numbered and Mr Hani was identified as a target </p>
<p class="line" id="line2063"><a name="pos2063"></a>because of the fact that he was the Secretary General of the ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line2064"><a name="pos2064"></a>and he was involved in MK and he was being seen as Mandela's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2065"><a name="pos2065"></a>successor, it was decided that he was the target for their offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2066"><a name="pos2066"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Who decided that?  Who made this decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2067"><a name="pos2067"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   This decision, together they decided </p>
<p class="line" id="line2068"><a name="pos2068"></a>about the target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2069"><a name="pos2069"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Derby-Lewis and Walus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2070"><a name="pos2070"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Yes, they decided about that jointly.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2071"><a name="pos2071"></a>But it is very clear and it was confirmed by Mr Derby-Lewis that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2072"><a name="pos2072"></a>Mr Derby-Lewis instructed Mr Walus to execute that decision </p>
<p class="line" id="line2073"><a name="pos2073"></a>they had made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2074"><a name="pos2074"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   On which authority was that made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2075"><a name="pos2075"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   According to the evidence of Mr Walus, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2076"><a name="pos2076"></a>he believed that because he regarded Mr Derby-Lewis as a CP </p>
<p class="line" id="line2077"><a name="pos2077"></a>policy maker, as a leader of the Conservative Party, he did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2078"><a name="pos2078"></a>only regard him as a politician, he believed that this was decided </p>
<p class="line" id="line2079"><a name="pos2079"></a>by the Conservative Party and that this instruction was given in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2080"><a name="pos2080"></a>the name of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2081"><a name="pos2081"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But on which authority - apart from what </p>
<p class="line" id="line2082"><a name="pos2082"></a>Mr Walus believed, on which authority did Mr Derby-Lewis, after </p>
<p class="line" id="line2083"><a name="pos2083"></a>they jointly decided, on whose authority did Mr Derby-Lewis give </p>
<p class="line" id="line2084"><a name="pos2084"></a>an instruction to Mr Walus to execute this joint decision?  Can </p>
<p class="line" id="line2085"><a name="pos2085"></a>you assist us in this respect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2086"><a name="pos2086"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   I want to submit that according to Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2087"><a name="pos2087"></a>Walus' evidence and the way in which he regarded, he regarded </p>
<p class="line" id="line2088"><a name="pos2088"></a>Mr Clive Derby-Lewis' instruction based on his position as an </p>
<p class="line" id="line2089"><a name="pos2089"></a>executive member of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2090"><a name="pos2090"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Where is there any documentation regarding </p>
<p class="line" id="line2091"><a name="pos2091"></a>this authority?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2092"><a name="pos2092"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   There's no documentation regarding this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2093"><a name="pos2093"></a>matter.  I want to submit to you that this can be gathered from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2094"><a name="pos2094"></a>Mr Walus' evidence.  He believed that as a result of the position </p>
<p class="line" id="line2095"><a name="pos2095"></a>Mr Derby-Lewis held in the Conservative Party, that instruction </p>
<p class="line" id="line2096"><a name="pos2096"></a>was based on the authority of that position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2097"><a name="pos2097"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   And according to you Mr Walus didn't have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2098"><a name="pos2098"></a>to look any higher up in the hierarchy than Mr Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2099"><a name="pos2099"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   That was also the way he saw that.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line2100"><a name="pos2100"></a>regarded Mr Derby-Lewis as a leader.  And together with that, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2101"><a name="pos2101"></a>this instruction - looking at his evidence in its whole, it did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2102"><a name="pos2102"></a>come out of the blue as something they've just decided on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2103"><a name="pos2103"></a>spur of the moment, it was part of this political struggle which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2104"><a name="pos2104"></a>was going on since early '90's.  That was since the time the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2105"><a name="pos2105"></a>ANC/SACP Alliance was there.  This must not be seen in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2106"><a name="pos2106"></a>isolation, that the instruction was just given on the spur of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2107"><a name="pos2107"></a>moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2108"><a name="pos2108"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   In that case we here have to do with a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2109"><a name="pos2109"></a>conventional instruction, we have to do with the joint decision of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2110"><a name="pos2110"></a>Walus and Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2111"><a name="pos2111"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   A decision was made in respect - </p>
<p class="line" id="line2112"><a name="pos2112"></a>because you must take the evidence into consideration that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2113"><a name="pos2113"></a>something had to be done about the right wing but the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2114"><a name="pos2114"></a>instruction, they jointly decided that Hani was the target but the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2115"><a name="pos2115"></a>instruction according to Mr Walus, this instruction came from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2116"><a name="pos2116"></a>Conservative Party by name, Mr Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2117"><a name="pos2117"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Yes, but I see no instruction, especially if </p>
<p class="line" id="line2118"><a name="pos2118"></a>you look at the amendment you've made on page 10.  It does not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2119"><a name="pos2119"></a>look like an instruction, it looks as if a decision had been made </p>
<p class="line" id="line2120"><a name="pos2120"></a>by two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2121"><a name="pos2121"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Definitely that decision was made but </p>
<p class="line" id="line2122"><a name="pos2122"></a>Mr Walus gave evidence with reference to Mrs Khampepe also </p>
<p class="line" id="line2123"><a name="pos2123"></a>had said, he regarded it as an instruction and Mr Derby-Lewis </p>
<p class="line" id="line2124"><a name="pos2124"></a>confirmed that.  Why would Mr Walus -I want to call it a kind of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2125"><a name="pos2125"></a>a foot soldier, he would not take such a decision all by himself.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2126"><a name="pos2126"></a>He would not make such a decision together with another foot </p>
<p class="line" id="line2127"><a name="pos2127"></a>soldier because he did according to his beliefs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2128"><a name="pos2128"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   No, but Mr Prinsloo said - if you can accept </p>
<p class="line" id="line2129"><a name="pos2129"></a>what is written on page 33, he said - page 27, paragraph 9, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2130"><a name="pos2130"></a>applicant and Walus decided that Hani had to be shot and Walus </p>
<p class="line" id="line2131"><a name="pos2131"></a>undertook to do this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2132"><a name="pos2132"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2133"><a name="pos2133"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   And there is a reference to certain pages in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2134"><a name="pos2134"></a>the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2135"><a name="pos2135"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   I want to submit it to you that there are </p>
<p class="line" id="line2136"><a name="pos2136"></a>people sitting together and making a decision to execute the task. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2137"><a name="pos2137"></a> For example, when a military operation has to be done, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2138"><a name="pos2138"></a>people sit together and make a decision.  There is always a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2139"><a name="pos2139"></a>leader, a leader who takes the initiative.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2140"><a name="pos2140"></a>	These two people sit together, they make a joint decision to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2141"><a name="pos2141"></a>do something.  There are political discussions which have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line2142"><a name="pos2142"></a>held - I don't want to refer to all that again, in which it was said </p>
<p class="line" id="line2143"><a name="pos2143"></a>that something had to be done.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2144"><a name="pos2144"></a>	Now Mr Derby-Lewis comes and they have certain talks, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2145"><a name="pos2145"></a>comes and he says: "Here are people, we have to do something".  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2146"><a name="pos2146"></a>On his instruction this murder list is prioritised and then the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2147"><a name="pos2147"></a>decision is made, like when you consider a decision, what will be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2148"><a name="pos2148"></a>the best target to serve our purposes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2149"><a name="pos2149"></a>	And jointly they decided that it would be Mr Hani,  then </p>
<p class="line" id="line2150"><a name="pos2150"></a>they had to go further.  Now the decision had to be made - as I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2151"><a name="pos2151"></a>understand Mr Prinsloo's heads, how this person had to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2152"><a name="pos2152"></a>eliminated was to shoot him.  It's not that Mr Derby-Lewis </p>
<p class="line" id="line2153"><a name="pos2153"></a>decided all by himself that he should be shot and he gave the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2154"><a name="pos2154"></a>instruction.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line2155"><a name="pos2155"></a>	I want to submit that during their discussions Mr Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line2156"><a name="pos2156"></a>Lewis was the leader and that Mr Walus acted on his instructions </p>
<p class="line" id="line2157"><a name="pos2157"></a>and said: "I will shoot him".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2158"><a name="pos2158"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:  ...[No English translation] In principal it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2159"><a name="pos2159"></a>decided to kill Mr Hani.  Whether he had to be shot or not, it's a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2160"><a name="pos2160"></a>question of detail.  The two of them together made a decision that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2161"><a name="pos2161"></a>he had to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2162"><a name="pos2162"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   I'm answering your question, that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2163"><a name="pos2163"></a>had decided, it's in comparison to what I've said, Mr Walus acted </p>
<p class="line" id="line2164"><a name="pos2164"></a>on instruction.  They jointly decided that he had to be shot.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line2165"><a name="pos2165"></a>decided he was the target but the joint decision that he had to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2166"><a name="pos2166"></a>shot doesn't make a difference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2167"><a name="pos2167"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   ...[inaudible] at some stage during their </p>
<p class="line" id="line2168"><a name="pos2168"></a>conversations, when they had this list before them, if they came </p>
<p class="line" id="line2169"><a name="pos2169"></a>to the conclusion that Mr Hani is to be eliminated, is the position </p>
<p class="line" id="line2170"><a name="pos2170"></a>not that Mr Walus volunteered to carry out the deed rather than </p>
<p class="line" id="line2171"><a name="pos2171"></a>being ordered to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2172"><a name="pos2172"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   He said that he would do it but what I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2173"><a name="pos2173"></a>want to put before the Commission, the whole decision making </p>
<p class="line" id="line2174"><a name="pos2174"></a>regarding this matter what was going to happen, that something </p>
<p class="line" id="line2175"><a name="pos2175"></a>had to be done, everything was inclusive of this instruction.  If </p>
<p class="line" id="line2176"><a name="pos2176"></a>Mr Walus said he would do it, somebody had to do it.  It does not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2177"><a name="pos2177"></a>change the fact that the decision making came from the leader, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2178"><a name="pos2178"></a>the person from the Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2179"><a name="pos2179"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2180"><a name="pos2180"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   Sorry, Mrs van der Walt, can I get further </p>
<p class="line" id="line2181"><a name="pos2181"></a>clarification.  I think it is not in dispute that Mr Walus and Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2182"><a name="pos2182"></a>Derby-Lewis jointly decided on the target for the assassination </p>
<p class="line" id="line2183"><a name="pos2183"></a>which was Mr Hani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2184"><a name="pos2184"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2185"><a name="pos2185"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   Now, the instructions which subsequently </p>
<p class="line" id="line2186"><a name="pos2186"></a>followed with regard to the execution, was after the selection of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2187"><a name="pos2187"></a>the target had been made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2188"><a name="pos2188"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2189"><a name="pos2189"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   In what capacity did Mr Walus participate in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2190"><a name="pos2190"></a>the selection of the target with Mr Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2191"><a name="pos2191"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   As I understand the evidence, after this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2192"><a name="pos2192"></a>list had been obtained, they decided that they had to find a target </p>
<p class="line" id="line2193"><a name="pos2193"></a>which would receive the necessary effect.  They jointly discussed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2194"><a name="pos2194"></a>this matter but this whole principle and the reason why it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2195"><a name="pos2195"></a>happened, all this came from Mr Derby-Lewis because was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2196"><a name="pos2196"></a>person who on that specific day came with the list and said: "Now </p>
<p class="line" id="line2197"><a name="pos2197"></a>we have to do something".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2198"><a name="pos2198"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   But when the decision was taken to target Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2199"><a name="pos2199"></a>Hani for assassination, would you say that Mr Walus was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2200"><a name="pos2200"></a>participating as a co-partner of Mr Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2201"><a name="pos2201"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Not at all, that was the evidence.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line2202"><a name="pos2202"></a>jointly decided about the target.  I've never argued otherwise, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2203"><a name="pos2203"></a>that was according to his evidence but it does not change.  And </p>
<p class="line" id="line2204"><a name="pos2204"></a>with respect, I want to argue, it does not change my argument </p>
<p class="line" id="line2205"><a name="pos2205"></a>that Mr Walus seen in the light of the executive person or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2206"><a name="pos2206"></a>executive politician by name, Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, that he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2207"><a name="pos2207"></a>still acting under his instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2208"><a name="pos2208"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   While you were leading Walus, at page 895 of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2209"><a name="pos2209"></a>the record, he said, and I read:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2210"><a name="pos2210"></a>		"After I numbered this list".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2211"><a name="pos2211"></a>and he said he numbered it in accordance with Clive Derby-Lewis' </p>
<p class="line" id="line2212"><a name="pos2212"></a>instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2213"><a name="pos2213"></a>		"Clive Derby-Lewis told me that we would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2214"><a name="pos2214"></a>concentrate on elimination of number 3, surname: </p>
<p class="line" id="line2215"><a name="pos2215"></a>Chris Hani and if for the CP and the right-wing will I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2216"><a name="pos2216"></a>agree to take this task on me.  I expressed my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2217"><a name="pos2217"></a>readiness and acceptance"</p>
<p class="line" id="line2218"><a name="pos2218"></a>There's no suggestion there of a discussion.  He said that Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line2219"><a name="pos2219"></a>Lewis told him that:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2220"><a name="pos2220"></a>		"We would concentrate on the elimination of Hani"</p>
<p class="line" id="line2221"><a name="pos2221"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   That is correct but if we look at Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2222"><a name="pos2222"></a>Clive Derby-Lewis' evidence there was a discussion and you'd </p>
<p class="line" id="line2223"><a name="pos2223"></a>accept - I don't want to speak to the detriment of my client, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line2224"><a name="pos2224"></a>we can accept that there was a discussion but Walus, according to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2225"><a name="pos2225"></a>his evidence, he did this on the instruction of Mr Clive Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line2226"><a name="pos2226"></a>Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2227"><a name="pos2227"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   In other words Mr Clive Derby-Lewis took </p>
<p class="line" id="line2228"><a name="pos2228"></a>the initiative, he was the person who had that idea right from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2229"><a name="pos2229"></a>beginning but at the end of the day what we have to do with are </p>
<p class="line" id="line2230"><a name="pos2230"></a>co-conspirators.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2231"><a name="pos2231"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Definitely, that is so but my client has </p>
<p class="line" id="line2232"><a name="pos2232"></a>to fulfil the requirements of the Act and his application is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2233"><a name="pos2233"></a>different from Mr Clive Derby-Lewis' because Mr Walus, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2234"><a name="pos2234"></a>according to his evidence, acted after the decision had been made. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2235"><a name="pos2235"></a> He acted on instruction of a member of the Conservative Party </p>
<p class="line" id="line2236"><a name="pos2236"></a>and that was according to his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2237"><a name="pos2237"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   That is what I can't understand but I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2238"><a name="pos2238"></a>want to interrupt you further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2239"><a name="pos2239"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   When do you want to adjourn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2240"><a name="pos2240"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Have you finished dealing with this particular </p>

<p class="line" id="line2242"><a name="pos2242"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2243"><a name="pos2243"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Very well, we'll adjourn at this stage and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2244"><a name="pos2244"></a>resume at 2 o'clock.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2246"><a name="pos2246"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2247"><a name="pos2247"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Please proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2248"><a name="pos2248"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2249"><a name="pos2249"></a>	I finished on page 14.  The applicant undertook to execute </p>
<p class="line" id="line2250"><a name="pos2250"></a>the elimination of Mr Hani on his own and on that very same day </p>
<p class="line" id="line2251"><a name="pos2251"></a>when the order was given to him he requested of Mr Clive Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line2252"><a name="pos2252"></a>Lewis to issue him an unlicensed firearm.  They also discussed it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2253"><a name="pos2253"></a>and it was decided that Mr Hani's home would be reconnoitred </p>
<p class="line" id="line2254"><a name="pos2254"></a>and early in March 1993 they reconnoitred the home of Mr Hani a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2255"><a name="pos2255"></a>number of times in order to establish the routine and movements </p>
<p class="line" id="line2256"><a name="pos2256"></a>of the home.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2257"><a name="pos2257"></a>	On the 6th of April 1993, he visited Mr Derby-Lewis at his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2258"><a name="pos2258"></a>home after an invitation from Mr Derby-Lewis to have breakfast </p>
<p class="line" id="line2259"><a name="pos2259"></a>there that morning.  On that day the unlicensed firearm was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2260"><a name="pos2260"></a>handed over to Mr Walus.  There was a discussion which involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line2261"><a name="pos2261"></a>that Mr Derby-Lewis would provide him with further ammunition </p>
<p class="line" id="line2262"><a name="pos2262"></a>and the silencer which was fitted to the firearm could not be used </p>
<p class="line" id="line2263"><a name="pos2263"></a>with regular ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2264"><a name="pos2264"></a>	On the 7th of April, Mr Walus once again contacted Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2265"><a name="pos2265"></a>Derby-Lewis or visited him in order to determine whether any </p>
<p class="line" id="line2266"><a name="pos2266"></a>changes had been made to the plans and whether he had managed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2267"><a name="pos2267"></a>to gain ammunition for him.  At that point he had not received </p>
<p class="line" id="line2268"><a name="pos2268"></a>any ammunition.  According to Mr Walus' testimony the only </p>
<p class="line" id="line2269"><a name="pos2269"></a>further suggestion which was made to him was that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2270"><a name="pos2270"></a>elimination be undertaken before the Easter weekend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2271"><a name="pos2271"></a>	On the 10th of April a Saturday, Mr Walus went, not with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2272"><a name="pos2272"></a>the purpose to shoot Mr Hani on that specific day, according to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2273"><a name="pos2273"></a>his testimony, he went for his regular exercise at a certain sports </p>
<p class="line" id="line2274"><a name="pos2274"></a>centre.  Thereafter he decided or the place or facility was closed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2275"><a name="pos2275"></a>because it was a public holiday and he decided that he would do </p>
<p class="line" id="line2276"><a name="pos2276"></a>further reconnaissance.  He had tested the weapon on his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2277"><a name="pos2277"></a>brother's small holding and found that the silencer could not fire </p>
<p class="line" id="line2278"><a name="pos2278"></a>automatically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2279"><a name="pos2279"></a>	He then decided that he would buy ammunition with his own </p>
<p class="line" id="line2280"><a name="pos2280"></a>firearm licence which would be the same ammunition as for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2281"><a name="pos2281"></a>unlicensed weapon.  He took a drive to go and do further </p>
<p class="line" id="line2282"><a name="pos2282"></a>reconnaissance at Mr Hani's home.  From the testimony of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2283"><a name="pos2283"></a>Walus you can see that it concurs with the testimony given in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2284"><a name="pos2284"></a>Supreme Court.  And on that day he saw Mr Hani in front of his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2285"><a name="pos2285"></a>house where he was climbing into his vehicle and there were no </p>
<p class="line" id="line2286"><a name="pos2286"></a>bodyguards present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2287"><a name="pos2287"></a>	Initially he thought that it was Mr Hani but he wanted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2288"><a name="pos2288"></a>make certain and he drove along behind the vehicle until it came </p>
<p class="line" id="line2289"><a name="pos2289"></a>to a shopping centre where Mr Hani</p>
<p class="line" id="line2290"><a name="pos2290"></a>climbed out of the vehicle and was positively identified as Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2291"><a name="pos2291"></a>Hani.  Thereafter when Mr Hani departed, he took another road </p>
<p class="line" id="line2292"><a name="pos2292"></a>and stopped behind Mr Hani's vehicle whereupon he climbed out, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2293"><a name="pos2293"></a>called out his name, Mr Hani reacted to that, he turned around </p>
<p class="line" id="line2294"><a name="pos2294"></a>and Mr Walus shot Mr Hani.  He shot him four times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2295"><a name="pos2295"></a>	Thereafter he departed and from the Court case his vehicle </p>
<p class="line" id="line2296"><a name="pos2296"></a>was identified by Mrs Harmse and Mr Walus was arrested shortly </p>
<p class="line" id="line2297"><a name="pos2297"></a>after the events.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2298"><a name="pos2298"></a>	In terms of Section 21(c), that is on page 21, it is clear that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2299"><a name="pos2299"></a>it is required by law that the applicant provide a full disclosure of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2300"><a name="pos2300"></a>all the relevant facts regarding the events.  If there are certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line2301"><a name="pos2301"></a>small issues which might not have any bearing matters which were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2302"><a name="pos2302"></a>emphasised during the hearing, especially with regard to Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2303"><a name="pos2303"></a>Walus and his actions, his brother dead after the glass works were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2304"><a name="pos2304"></a>declared insolvent, these details are of minor import and not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2305"><a name="pos2305"></a>relevant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2306"><a name="pos2306"></a>	I would like to submit to the Honourable Committee that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2307"><a name="pos2307"></a>the applicant has made a full disclosure of all the relevant facts </p>
<p class="line" id="line2308"><a name="pos2308"></a>and the legal counsel of the family and the SACP have submitted </p>
<p class="line" id="line2309"><a name="pos2309"></a>the statements before the Committee. And the so-called </p>
<p class="line" id="line2310"><a name="pos2310"></a>statements which Mr Walus would have made to Captain Deetliefs </p>
<p class="line" id="line2311"><a name="pos2311"></a>and with the intention of the submission of these statements to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2312"><a name="pos2312"></a>the Committee, the intention is to make it clear that there are </p>
<p class="line" id="line2313"><a name="pos2313"></a>facts which the applicant did not disclose and there is a greater </p>
<p class="line" id="line2314"><a name="pos2314"></a>conspiracy.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2315"><a name="pos2315"></a>	The applicant was arrested and detained in the Benoni </p>
<p class="line" id="line2316"><a name="pos2316"></a>police cells and it would appear quite clearly from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2317"><a name="pos2317"></a>documentation that he did not want to make any statement unless </p>
<p class="line" id="line2318"><a name="pos2318"></a>he had legal representation.  He was taken from the cells by </p>
<p class="line" id="line2319"><a name="pos2319"></a>various police officers and interviewed or questioned by various </p>
<p class="line" id="line2320"><a name="pos2320"></a>police officers until, on the 14th of April 1993, he fell into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2321"><a name="pos2321"></a>hands of Captain Deetliefs.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2322"><a name="pos2322"></a>	He was once again taken out to his residence by Captain </p>
<p class="line" id="line2323"><a name="pos2323"></a>Deetliefs, taken back to his cell and on that day, the 14th of April </p>
<p class="line" id="line2324"><a name="pos2324"></a>the applicant said to Captain Deetliefs that he would like use his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2325"><a name="pos2325"></a>right to silence and did not wish to make any statements unless </p>
<p class="line" id="line2326"><a name="pos2326"></a>his legal representative was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2327"><a name="pos2327"></a>	On the 15th of April 1993 until early morning hours of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2328"><a name="pos2328"></a>16th of April, the applicant the applicant was questioned for 11 </p>
<p class="line" id="line2329"><a name="pos2329"></a>hours and according to Captain Deetliefs notes were taken which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2330"><a name="pos2330"></a>are not available.  No statement was taken from the applicant on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2331"><a name="pos2331"></a>that particular evening.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2332"><a name="pos2332"></a>	In the early morning hours the applicant was placed back in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2333"><a name="pos2333"></a>his cells, that is on the 16th at twenty past five.  That very same </p>
<p class="line" id="line2334"><a name="pos2334"></a>afternoon, at 16H05 he was once again taken out of the cell and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2335"><a name="pos2335"></a>once again questioned for approximately 14 hours and yet again </p>
<p class="line" id="line2336"><a name="pos2336"></a>notes were not taken and no statement was taken either.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2337"><a name="pos2337"></a>	The early morning hours of 16 April 1993, approximately </p>
<p class="line" id="line2338"><a name="pos2338"></a>04H15 that morning the applicant began, according to Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2339"><a name="pos2339"></a>Deetliefs, to cooperate.  That is so, the applicant has confirmed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2340"><a name="pos2340"></a>this.  The applicant confirmed that he cooperated as a result of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2341"><a name="pos2341"></a>the fact that Captain Deetliefs caught him or tricked him and by </p>
<p class="line" id="line2342"><a name="pos2342"></a>means of lies he led him to believe, this is Deetliefs, that he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2343"><a name="pos2343"></a>infiltrated the security police, that they were actually cooperating </p>
<p class="line" id="line2344"><a name="pos2344"></a>with Tienie Groenewaldt and that if he would cooperate it could </p>
<p class="line" id="line2345"><a name="pos2345"></a>result that Mr Holmes, who was the investigating officer in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2346"><a name="pos2346"></a>case at that time, would not make any further arrests and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2347"><a name="pos2347"></a>Deetliefs was actually working for the right-wingers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2348"><a name="pos2348"></a>	The applicant in his testimony stated that he was extremely </p>
<p class="line" id="line2349"><a name="pos2349"></a>naive and he realised this later, it was naive of him to believe </p>
<p class="line" id="line2350"><a name="pos2350"></a>Captain Deetliefs.  The only notes which are available from this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2351"><a name="pos2351"></a>questioning, from which point on the applicant would have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line2352"><a name="pos2352"></a>cooperating, would the hand-written notes - just a moment please, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2353"><a name="pos2353"></a>page 84, 85 and 86, that would be in R4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2354"><a name="pos2354"></a>	There are the only notes from all these hours of questioning </p>
<p class="line" id="line2355"><a name="pos2355"></a>which were provided by Captain Deetliefs and can be provided.  If </p>
<p class="line" id="line2356"><a name="pos2356"></a>the video cassettes are watched it is logical that there wouldn't be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2357"><a name="pos2357"></a>any notes, however in Captain Deetliefs' statement which is to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2358"><a name="pos2358"></a>found in R4 continued he at several points mentions that notes </p>
<p class="line" id="line2359"><a name="pos2359"></a>were taken down by Mr Beetge.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2360"><a name="pos2360"></a>	That cannot be so because he could not make a statement to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2361"><a name="pos2361"></a>the Attorney General of the Witwatersrand, Mr Klaus von Leerus </p>
<p class="line" id="line2362"><a name="pos2362"></a>at that time, in which he would state, in terms of everything that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2363"><a name="pos2363"></a>had happened, that he was infiltrating the police and working </p>
<p class="line" id="line2364"><a name="pos2364"></a>along with Tinnie Groenewaldt and that is why there weren't any </p>
<p class="line" id="line2365"><a name="pos2365"></a>notes.  But what is shocking is that he says on numerous times in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2366"><a name="pos2366"></a>his statement that notes were taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2367"><a name="pos2367"></a>	These are the only notes ...[intervention]</p>

<p class="line" id="line2370"><a name="pos2370"></a>R4 continued?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2371"><a name="pos2371"></a>MRS VAN DER WALT:   His first statement is in the first pages, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2372"><a name="pos2372"></a>page 299 and then it is placed again at a later point in the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line2373"><a name="pos2373"></a>bundle but I will refer you to these statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2374"><a name="pos2374"></a>	The applicants has also mentioned that during those long </p>
<p class="line" id="line2375"><a name="pos2375"></a>hours of questioning, alcohol was given to him.  That was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2376"><a name="pos2376"></a>confirmed.  One can also see on one of the video cassettes that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2377"><a name="pos2377"></a>is drinking beer.  The applicant said that he could have been given </p>
<p class="line" id="line2378"><a name="pos2378"></a>sedatives because the alcohol effected him quite severely.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2379"><a name="pos2379"></a>	But the most important aspect is that Captain Deetliefs </p>
<p class="line" id="line2380"><a name="pos2380"></a>tricked the applicant with his lies.  The applicant then provided </p>
<p class="line" id="line2381"><a name="pos2381"></a>these details as appears in the hand-written documents but the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2382"><a name="pos2382"></a>applicant testifies that Deetliefs always, with everything that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2383"><a name="pos2383"></a>said, sketched it or sketched the applicant's words to be more </p>
<p class="line" id="line2384"><a name="pos2384"></a>sensational in order to qualify what Deetliefs was actually looking </p>
<p class="line" id="line2385"><a name="pos2385"></a>for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2386"><a name="pos2386"></a>	The applicants was continuously questioned by Mr Bizos </p>
<p class="line" id="line2387"><a name="pos2387"></a>and especially as I understand, it was to prove this larger </p>
<p class="line" id="line2388"><a name="pos2388"></a>conspiracy and that the applicant was not making a full disclosure </p>
<p class="line" id="line2389"><a name="pos2389"></a>and so it was put to the applicant that he had reconnoitred </p>
<p class="line" id="line2390"><a name="pos2390"></a>Mandela's home and that is why Mrs Beyers was called, in order </p>
<p class="line" id="line2391"><a name="pos2391"></a>to prove that the applicant was telling lies when he said that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2392"><a name="pos2392"></a>had reconnoitred Mr Mandela's home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2393"><a name="pos2393"></a>	According to the statement of Mr Deetliefs he said, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2394"><a name="pos2394"></a>that is R4, 306 continued and 361, where he says especially on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2395"><a name="pos2395"></a>page 361 in the middle, that would be the statement which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2396"><a name="pos2396"></a>Deetliefs had written but it was written as if it was the words of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2397"><a name="pos2397"></a>the applicant:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2398"><a name="pos2398"></a>		"Rekkies was also done on Mandela's house.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2399"><a name="pos2399"></a>thought the old goat was not worth it"</p>
<p class="line" id="line2400"><a name="pos2400"></a>But nowhere, on one of those cassettes, there are 10 cassettes </p>
<p class="line" id="line2401"><a name="pos2401"></a>which have bearing on Mr Walus, this does not appear on one of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2402"><a name="pos2402"></a>those cassettes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2403"><a name="pos2403"></a>	As it appears in this statement from page 306, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2404"><a name="pos2404"></a>Honourable Committee will note that 301 or 304 and 305 are the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2405"><a name="pos2405"></a>typed versions of the hand-written notes.  From page 306, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2406"><a name="pos2406"></a>Captain Deetliefs went to a lot of effort, he wrote his statement </p>
<p class="line" id="line2407"><a name="pos2407"></a>and then there's a question:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2408"><a name="pos2408"></a>		"Captain"</p>
<p class="line" id="line2409"><a name="pos2409"></a>and the question follows, then it says:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2410"><a name="pos2410"></a>		"Walus"</p>
<p class="line" id="line2411"><a name="pos2411"></a>and then there's an answer that follows.  Where are those notes </p>
<p class="line" id="line2412"><a name="pos2412"></a>from which he would have retrieved this information? </p>
<p class="line" id="line2413"><a name="pos2413"></a>	He could not submit this to the Honourable Committee </p>
<p class="line" id="line2414"><a name="pos2414"></a>because what was said there never was said in fact.  And it is also </p>
<p class="line" id="line2415"><a name="pos2415"></a>said in various places in the statement that the applicant was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2416"><a name="pos2416"></a>warned according to Judges' rules.   It does not appear on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2417"><a name="pos2417"></a>cassettes and it won't, it cannot because the Honourable </p>
<p class="line" id="line2418"><a name="pos2418"></a>Committee must understand and it was conceded by Advocate </p>
<p class="line" id="line2419"><a name="pos2419"></a>Brand, that the applicant had been misled.  Captain Deetliefs </p>
<p class="line" id="line2420"><a name="pos2420"></a>could not have warned him because they were busy with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2421"><a name="pos2421"></a>clandestine discussions where Deetliefs would be assisting the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2422"><a name="pos2422"></a>right-wingers, why would he warn them then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2423"><a name="pos2423"></a>	In my heads I submitted to the Honourable Committee that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2424"><a name="pos2424"></a>Captain Deetliefs was a liar and that he's nothing else but that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2425"><a name="pos2425"></a>and that the video cassettes and the statement are proof of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2426"><a name="pos2426"></a>	The applicant told the Committee that at a stage he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2427"><a name="pos2427"></a>driven past Mr Mandela's home at that point and the translation it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2428"><a name="pos2428"></a>would appear, the English of the applicant in the statement is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2429"><a name="pos2429"></a>quite clumsy, one does not know how the translation came </p>
<p class="line" id="line2430"><a name="pos2430"></a>through from the Polish to the English but he said that it was put </p>
<p class="line" id="line2431"><a name="pos2431"></a>to him - I don't have it here at the moment, it was asked of him </p>
<p class="line" id="line2432"><a name="pos2432"></a>how he managed to obtain the address of Mr Mandela and he said </p>
<p class="line" id="line2433"><a name="pos2433"></a>- and he continues, I must concede, but as, and there is such </p>
<p class="line" id="line2434"><a name="pos2434"></a>proof, the home of Mr Mandela appeared in the Citizen </p>
<p class="line" id="line2435"><a name="pos2435"></a>Newspaper and according to the applicant he drove past simply </p>
<p class="line" id="line2436"><a name="pos2436"></a>out of curiosity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2437"><a name="pos2437"></a>	I submit to the Honourable Committee that the target which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2438"><a name="pos2438"></a>they had discussed and which was pointed out by Mr Clive Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line2439"><a name="pos2439"></a>Lewis was only Mr Hani and not Mr Mandela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2440"><a name="pos2440"></a>	It was also put to the applicant during cross-examination </p>
<p class="line" id="line2441"><a name="pos2441"></a>and it is also supported, that there was a conspiracy to murder </p>
<p class="line" id="line2442"><a name="pos2442"></a>the others whose names appeared on the list - and I refer to R4 </p>
<p class="line" id="line2443"><a name="pos2443"></a>on page 308, where Captain Deetliefs once again - this is point 2 </p>
<p class="line" id="line2444"><a name="pos2444"></a>on page 308, once again it is:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2445"><a name="pos2445"></a>		"Captain"</p>
<p class="line" id="line2446"><a name="pos2446"></a>I have never seen a policeman make this kind of statement, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2447"><a name="pos2447"></a>nonetheless:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2448"><a name="pos2448"></a>		"Captain: Cuba, do you think there is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2449"><a name="pos2449"></a>possibility that others on the list could </p>
<p class="line" id="line2450"><a name="pos2450"></a>still be eliminated after your arrest"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2451"><a name="pos2451"></a>then it is:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2452"><a name="pos2452"></a>		"Yes, they are all bastards.  The one is only more </p>
<p class="line" id="line2453"><a name="pos2453"></a>dangerous than the other one.  Clive is a guy with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2454"><a name="pos2454"></a>balls, he will know what to do.  You must know, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2455"><a name="pos2455"></a>saw it as a war situation, a political issue"</p>
<p class="line" id="line2456"><a name="pos2456"></a>EXTREMELY BAD RECORDING FROM THIS POINT ON</p>
<p class="line" id="line2457"><a name="pos2457"></a>It is absolutely frightening Mr Chairperson, if one would watch </p>
<p class="line" id="line2458"><a name="pos2458"></a>the tape, that is tape number 8 - and I mentioned that in my heads </p>
<p class="line" id="line2459"><a name="pos2459"></a>of the 22nd of April 1993 and the time is 12H25, what appears on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2460"><a name="pos2460"></a>the tape and if one would watch the entire tape it would still be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2461"><a name="pos2461"></a>this Deetliefs and Beetge, no notes are being taken.  One can see </p>
<p class="line" id="line2462"><a name="pos2462"></a>Beetge's hand, they are planning to help the right-wingers.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2463"><a name="pos2463"></a>	And Deetliefs will say: "They don't want to discuss it too </p>
<p class="line" id="line2464"><a name="pos2464"></a>openly because it's supposed to be a secret".  Then Deetliefs says, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2465"><a name="pos2465"></a>while they are discussing who will be the successor of Hani, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2466"><a name="pos2466"></a>Deetliefs says, and this is not the applicant, Deetliefs proposes </p>
<p class="line" id="line2467"><a name="pos2467"></a>that Sexwale would be the possible successor.  Then Deetliefs </p>
<p class="line" id="line2468"><a name="pos2468"></a>says that: "Sexwale is a bastard", upon which the applicant </p>
<p class="line" id="line2469"><a name="pos2469"></a>answers -he's sitting there and this was recorded within the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2470"><a name="pos2470"></a>prison, he's sitting at the table with his head turned and he says:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2471"><a name="pos2471"></a>		"They're all bastards".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2472"><a name="pos2472"></a>	On the same tape further on, the typed 1301, Deetliefs is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2473"><a name="pos2473"></a>still in discussion with the applicant and he expresses great praise </p>
<p class="line" id="line2474"><a name="pos2474"></a>of Clive Derby-Lewis, that he is such a wonderful man, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2475"><a name="pos2475"></a>people trust him - this is Deetliefs speaking, and then they discuss </p>
<p class="line" id="line2476"><a name="pos2476"></a>the fact that Clive Derby-Lewis was involved with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2477"><a name="pos2477"></a>Witwatersrand ...[indistinct] and then the applicant makes the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2478"><a name="pos2478"></a>following remark:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2479"><a name="pos2479"></a>		"Clive Derby-Lewis is a good man, he is a man of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2480"><a name="pos2480"></a>balls - he's a guy of balls".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2481"><a name="pos2481"></a>excuse me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2482"><a name="pos2482"></a>	What is contained there on page 308 does not exist. It is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2483"><a name="pos2483"></a>not that it was interpreted incorrectly, it simply doesn't exist at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2484"><a name="pos2484"></a>all.  That which Deetliefs had written here was his own story.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line2485"><a name="pos2485"></a>had taken discussions with the applicants, written it down to suit </p>
<p class="line" id="line2486"><a name="pos2486"></a>his own purposes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2487"><a name="pos2487"></a>	He also wanted to try to prove that there was a greater </p>
<p class="line" id="line2488"><a name="pos2488"></a>conspiracy at hand because already from that point when the case </p>
<p class="line" id="line2489"><a name="pos2489"></a>was being investigated, foreign investigators were called in to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2490"><a name="pos2490"></a>assist with the investigation but it doesn't end there.  I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2491"><a name="pos2491"></a>simply highlighted those sections with regard to which the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2492"><a name="pos2492"></a>applicant was cross-examined, but it is absolutely frightening to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2493"><a name="pos2493"></a>watch those tapes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2494"><a name="pos2494"></a>	On page 301 - I'd like to refer the Committee to this, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2495"><a name="pos2495"></a>Deetliefs here makes a very long statement and it is here where </p>
<p class="line" id="line2496"><a name="pos2496"></a>his style changes - I don't know if he became tired, but now </p>
<p class="line" id="line2497"><a name="pos2497"></a>assumes a sort of discussion form of what the applicant had said </p>
<p class="line" id="line2498"><a name="pos2498"></a>to him.  What appears on page 301 certainly does not appear on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2499"><a name="pos2499"></a>the video tapes.  He refers, himself, to the video tape.  He also </p>
<p class="line" id="line2500"><a name="pos2500"></a>states  that is was the 18th of April at 11H02 in Pretoria </p>
<p class="line" id="line2501"><a name="pos2501"></a>Maximum and all these details are given, for example that - this in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2502"><a name="pos2502"></a>the middle of that page, that Clive's wife Gay, was not present on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2503"><a name="pos2503"></a>that particular evening but at the handing over of the weapon and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2504"><a name="pos2504"></a>the murder list, that is not on the video tape and it does not </p>

<p class="line" id="line2537"><a name="pos2537"></a>Deetliefs but on the tape Deetliefs and Beetge are still busy with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2538"><a name="pos2538"></a>this clandestine operation they are going to execute to support </p>
<p class="line" id="line2539"><a name="pos2539"></a>the right wing.  ...[indistinct] had come and he said:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2540"><a name="pos2540"></a>		"...[indistinct] a quotation and he mentioned it to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2541"><a name="pos2541"></a>applicant"</p>
<p class="line" id="line2542"><a name="pos2542"></a>	The applicant sat still, according to the tape, and it's very </p>
<p class="line" id="line2543"><a name="pos2543"></a>clear that he did not really realise what the meaning of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2544"><a name="pos2544"></a>quotation was.  He did not understand the meaning because he did </p>
<p class="line" id="line2545"><a name="pos2545"></a>not react, Beetge made the quotation and he did not react and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2546"><a name="pos2546"></a>then Deetliefs came and he explained to the applicant what the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2547"><a name="pos2547"></a>meaning of that quotation was.  Deetliefs explained it and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2548"><a name="pos2548"></a>applied this ...[indistinct] to the "Wit Wolve".  	What is there, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2549"><a name="pos2549"></a>what is stated there what the applicant should have said is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2550"><a name="pos2550"></a>absolutely wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2551"><a name="pos2551"></a>	This is all regarding the quotation but there is a long </p>
<p class="line" id="line2552"><a name="pos2552"></a>statement made by Deetliefs(?) from page 312 to 321, regarding </p>
<p class="line" id="line2553"><a name="pos2553"></a>certain identifications which had been made which did not take </p>
<p class="line" id="line2554"><a name="pos2554"></a>place.  ...[indistinct] done by another officer and usually a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2555"><a name="pos2555"></a>photographer accompanies them.  Deetliefs said there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2556"><a name="pos2556"></a>photographer but the applicant said he went to the ...[indistinct] </p>
<p class="line" id="line2557"><a name="pos2557"></a>and the applicant said they had some beer there and a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2558"><a name="pos2558"></a>photographer was never present there and he never ...[indistinct] </p>
<p class="line" id="line2559"><a name="pos2559"></a>Mr Mandela's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2560"><a name="pos2560"></a>	I wish to argue that the applicant did not make any </p>
<p class="line" id="line2561"><a name="pos2561"></a>statements apart from the statement where he said he did not want </p>
<p class="line" id="line2562"><a name="pos2562"></a>to make any statement and these written notes which is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2563"><a name="pos2563"></a>applicants version and that the other so-called statements </p>
<p class="line" id="line2564"><a name="pos2564"></a>...[indistinct] are mentioned in Deetliefs statement have no value </p>
<p class="line" id="line2565"><a name="pos2565"></a>should be attached to those because they are absolutely wrong </p>
<p class="line" id="line2566"><a name="pos2566"></a>and Deetliefs is an absolutely unreliable person.  This is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2567"><a name="pos2567"></a>supported by the video tapes and by the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2568"><a name="pos2568"></a>	Mr Prinsloo has already ...[indistinct] regarding Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line2569"><a name="pos2569"></a>Beyers.  I refer to that in my heads, I'm not going to do it now.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2570"><a name="pos2570"></a>The applicant denies that during that time he went to Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2571"><a name="pos2571"></a>Mandela's house.  ...[indistinct] as mentioned by the family </p>
<p class="line" id="line2572"><a name="pos2572"></a>...[indistinct].  The fact that the applicant, it was said that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2573"><a name="pos2573"></a>applicant - his evidence for amnesty was changed after Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2574"><a name="pos2574"></a>...[indistinct] programme.  	I want to submit to you that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2575"><a name="pos2575"></a>changes had already been made on September in 1996, where he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2576"><a name="pos2576"></a>said he acted on instruction of Mr Clive Derby-Lewis.  I want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2577"><a name="pos2577"></a>submit that there is no evidence at all that there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2578"><a name="pos2578"></a>...[indistinct] conspiracy.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2579"><a name="pos2579"></a>	I also want to submit to you that the applicant, that there's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2580"><a name="pos2580"></a>no evidence that it was found that there could have been a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2581"><a name="pos2581"></a>possible conspiracy in compiling the list or any other conspiracy, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2582"><a name="pos2582"></a>the applicant was not aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2583"><a name="pos2583"></a>	Then I want to submit that the applicant complied with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2584"><a name="pos2584"></a>requirement - and I've also presented my heads on the various </p>
<p class="line" id="line2585"><a name="pos2585"></a>requirements.  And ...[indistinct] and according to Section </p>
<p class="line" id="line2586"><a name="pos2586"></a>...[indistinct] 2(a) and ...[indistinct] that they are applicable to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2587"><a name="pos2587"></a>the ...[indistinct] and that he should get amnesty. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2588"><a name="pos2588"></a>END OF TAPE DUE TO POOR RECORDING</p>
<p class="line" id="line2589"><a name="pos2589"></a>MS VAN DER WALT:   ...and I also want to submit that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2590"><a name="pos2590"></a>criteria as put in a subsection 3 Act that I dealt with and that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2591"><a name="pos2591"></a>applicant also complies with that, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2592"><a name="pos2592"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Are there no objective facts which point out </p>
<p class="line" id="line2593"><a name="pos2593"></a>to a wider conspiracy? </p>
<p class="line" id="line2594"><a name="pos2594"></a>	What worries me, I think I raised this with Mr Walus, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2595"><a name="pos2595"></a>that broad daylight he goes to Mr Hani's place, he shoots him, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2596"><a name="pos2596"></a>walks away, gets into the car, drives away, the weapon is left in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2597"><a name="pos2597"></a>the car and he just normally joins the traffic as if nothing has </p>
<p class="line" id="line2598"><a name="pos2598"></a>happened. What assurance did he have, did he have some kind of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2599"><a name="pos2599"></a>assurance that don't you worry, you can do it, even if I do it you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2600"><a name="pos2600"></a>can be covered somehow, don't you worry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2601"><a name="pos2601"></a>MS VAN DER WALT:   I want to submit to you, it seems strange </p>
<p class="line" id="line2602"><a name="pos2602"></a>perhaps but the circumstances, and that is the only evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line2603"><a name="pos2603"></a>which is before you, the circumstances lent to this offence being </p>
<p class="line" id="line2604"><a name="pos2604"></a>committed at that stage, the police took all these various aspects </p>
<p class="line" id="line2605"><a name="pos2605"></a>into consideration, investigated everything, he was on his way to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2606"><a name="pos2606"></a>go and practise, he drove by, the opportunity just arose when Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2607"><a name="pos2607"></a>Hani, according to the other report, he did not spend the Friday </p>
<p class="line" id="line2608"><a name="pos2608"></a>night at home, and his bodyguards got off for the night or the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2609"><a name="pos2609"></a>weekend, he was all by himself, the circumstances just lent it to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2610"><a name="pos2610"></a>this.  The firearm was in his togbag and he can't mention a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2611"><a name="pos2611"></a>coincidence if you're a Christian you don't believe in that, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line2612"><a name="pos2612"></a>Mrs Harmse saw the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2613"><a name="pos2613"></a>	I just want to bring these facts from the trial.  She saw this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2614"><a name="pos2614"></a>vehicle but the number being presented to the police from the red </p>
<p class="line" id="line2615"><a name="pos2615"></a>vehicle, that one number was wrong and the police officers, a du </p>
<p class="line" id="line2616"><a name="pos2616"></a>Toit and an Olivier, they gave evidence, they drove around the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2617"><a name="pos2617"></a>road and they  heard this over the police radio, they saw the red </p>
<p class="line" id="line2618"><a name="pos2618"></a>car but this number was wrong and they pulled him off the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2619"><a name="pos2619"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   I would imagine if my recollection is correct </p>
<p class="line" id="line2620"><a name="pos2620"></a>with regard to his evidence, he was simply not worried at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2621"><a name="pos2621"></a>time, even though he saw the police, the traffic police, I can't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2622"><a name="pos2622"></a>remember if it was traffic police.  The impression I got he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2623"><a name="pos2623"></a>not unduly perturbed or he was not nervous, he didn't panic, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2624"><a name="pos2624"></a>didn't try to change and drive to another direction to see whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line2625"><a name="pos2625"></a>they would follow him, he just drove like anybody as if he hadn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2626"><a name="pos2626"></a>done anything wrong, which is rather strange, one wouldn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2627"><a name="pos2627"></a>expect that kind of behaviour from somebody who has just </p>
<p class="line" id="line2628"><a name="pos2628"></a>committed murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2629"><a name="pos2629"></a>MS VAN DER WALT:   With respect, according to his evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line2630"><a name="pos2630"></a>he did say that he noticed that it was the police and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2631"><a name="pos2631"></a>furthermore said that when he got out from his vehicle he couldn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2632"><a name="pos2632"></a>drive away quickly, then he would have drawn more attention.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2633"><a name="pos2633"></a>He was in the traffic and then he also stated further, he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2634"><a name="pos2634"></a>standing there and he thought he had to see how this whole thing </p>
<p class="line" id="line2635"><a name="pos2635"></a>would develop.  I did not think he thought he would be arrested </p>
<p class="line" id="line2636"><a name="pos2636"></a>at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2637"><a name="pos2637"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Well it's not only Mr Walus' problem if it is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2638"><a name="pos2638"></a>problem at all.  Their evidence that they had hoped that in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2639"><a name="pos2639"></a>midst of all the crimes, certain things would happen, certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line2640"><a name="pos2640"></a>people would do certain things, in particular the right wing would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2641"><a name="pos2641"></a>step in.  I don't know on what basis they would have thought </p>
<p class="line" id="line2642"><a name="pos2642"></a>what happened if they had not made some kind of arrangements, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2643"><a name="pos2643"></a>some understanding with some other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2644"><a name="pos2644"></a>MS VAN DER WALT:   As I've understood Mr Derby-Lewis' </p>
<p class="line" id="line2645"><a name="pos2645"></a>evidence and if Mr Walus was not arrested so quickly who would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2646"><a name="pos2646"></a>have gone to clear this out with the Caucus and if chaos had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2647"><a name="pos2647"></a>developed, they believed, and if I understand his evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line2648"><a name="pos2648"></a>correctly, after this incident the Volksfront was established and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2649"><a name="pos2649"></a>here all the right wing groups joined forces.  The Volksfront was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2650"><a name="pos2650"></a>established and later on the Freedom Front, it was a political </p>
<p class="line" id="line2651"><a name="pos2651"></a>party was established but according to the evidence, if I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2652"><a name="pos2652"></a>understand that correctly, this incident led to the establishment of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2653"><a name="pos2653"></a>the Volksfront.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2654"><a name="pos2654"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   It would have been an assumption bordering </p>
<p class="line" id="line2655"><a name="pos2655"></a>on naivety to just assume that well he killed somebody and well </p>
<p class="line" id="line2656"><a name="pos2656"></a>the two of us, just the two of us agreed to kill him without telling </p>
<p class="line" id="line2657"><a name="pos2657"></a>anybody, the two of us would kill him and even though we have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2658"><a name="pos2658"></a>not canvassed this thing, we have not made any contingent </p>
<p class="line" id="line2659"><a name="pos2659"></a>arrangements with anybody, the Right Wing will step in and take </p>
<p class="line" id="line2660"><a name="pos2660"></a>over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2661"><a name="pos2661"></a>MS VAN DER WALT:  Well I believe that during that time in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2662"><a name="pos2662"></a>country there was chaos. If you look at the evidence of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2663"><a name="pos2663"></a>Hartzenberg and the exhibit, one or other research where the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2664"><a name="pos2664"></a>political violence of those times, if you look at that I believe that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2665"><a name="pos2665"></a>Mr Derby-Lewis who was well acquainted with the politics could </p>
<p class="line" id="line2666"><a name="pos2666"></a>have believed that through that chaos the right wing groups </p>
<p class="line" id="line2667"><a name="pos2667"></a>would have become one united group, and they could have taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line2668"><a name="pos2668"></a>over the government of the day without any further arrangement </p>
<p class="line" id="line2669"><a name="pos2669"></a>with other people.  This just followed naturally, yes if things did </p>
<p class="line" id="line2670"><a name="pos2670"></a>not go wrong, they could have approached the right wing in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2671"><a name="pos2671"></a>regard. 	</p>
<p class="line" id="line2672"><a name="pos2672"></a>	But regarding your initial question that Mr Walus just </p>
<p class="line" id="line2673"><a name="pos2673"></a>drove away and he did not panic, there is no evidence, and it's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2674"><a name="pos2674"></a>also no other person assisted him.  Mr Mpshe asked him whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line2675"><a name="pos2675"></a>there were any road blocks, he said no he didn't see any road </p>
<p class="line" id="line2676"><a name="pos2676"></a>blocks. I don't know what the intention of that question was, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2677"><a name="pos2677"></a>whether the police or somebody else would have helped him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2678"><a name="pos2678"></a>there were no road blocks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2679"><a name="pos2679"></a>...(tape ends  - no further argument by Ms van der Walt</p>
<p class="line" id="line2680"><a name="pos2680"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2681"><a name="pos2681"></a>MR BIZOS:   May I first give  members of the Committee an </p>
<p class="line" id="line2682"><a name="pos2682"></a>overview Mr Chair before I start to argue the matter in detail?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2683"><a name="pos2683"></a>Firstly I would like to indicate to the Committee that my learned </p>
<p class="line" id="line2684"><a name="pos2684"></a>friend Mr Malindi and I have agreed to share the argument that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2685"><a name="pos2685"></a>to be advanced with the Committee.  Generally I will deal with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2686"><a name="pos2686"></a>pages 1 to 20, my learned friend will deal with pages 20 to 45, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2687"><a name="pos2687"></a>and I will deal with the rest of the argument.  But having with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2688"><a name="pos2688"></a>respect listened to the argument of Counsel for the applicants and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2689"><a name="pos2689"></a>the questions that were posed by the Committee and some of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2690"><a name="pos2690"></a>answers have been given, we would like to make certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line2691"><a name="pos2691"></a>preliminary submissions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2692"><a name="pos2692"></a>	Firstly that before we can try to apply the facts to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2693"><a name="pos2693"></a>provisions of Section 20, the committees onerous duty is to try </p>
<p class="line" id="line2694"><a name="pos2694"></a>and determine the facts and the facts obviously cannot be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2695"><a name="pos2695"></a>determined without meaningful submissions having been made to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2696"><a name="pos2696"></a>the committee about the credibility of the witnesses that have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2697"><a name="pos2697"></a>given evidence before you. And before we get to the application </p>
<p class="line" id="line2698"><a name="pos2698"></a>of the facts to the provisions of the Act we would like to make </p>
<p class="line" id="line2699"><a name="pos2699"></a>certain general submissions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2700"><a name="pos2700"></a>	Firstly for the purposes of these preliminary submissions, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2701"><a name="pos2701"></a>we submit that the evidence of Mr Derby-Lewis, Mr Walus and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2702"><a name="pos2702"></a>Mrs Derby-Lewis can be grouped together and what I am about to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2703"><a name="pos2703"></a>say about each one of them as witnesses applies although not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2704"><a name="pos2704"></a>squarely in general terms to each one of them.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2705"><a name="pos2705"></a>	Firstly that they are witnesses who on their own version </p>
<p class="line" id="line2706"><a name="pos2706"></a>have admitted that they are not strangers to lies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2707"><a name="pos2707"></a>	We start with Mr Derby-Lewis.  Although he did not give </p>
<p class="line" id="line2708"><a name="pos2708"></a>evidence at his trial, he thereafter made an affidavit in which, not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2709"><a name="pos2709"></a>only did he say that he was innocent of his crimes, but he also </p>
<p class="line" id="line2710"><a name="pos2710"></a>tried to hold himself out as a most unfortunate victim of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2711"><a name="pos2711"></a>administration of justice; he not only lied about his participation </p>
<p class="line" id="line2712"><a name="pos2712"></a>in this murder, he lied about having been not properly defended </p>
<p class="line" id="line2713"><a name="pos2713"></a>and complaining about his attorney and counsel, and when this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2714"><a name="pos2714"></a>untruthfulness is drawn to his attention, he says well I committed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2715"><a name="pos2715"></a>perjury because I considered that it was still part of the struggle. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2716"><a name="pos2716"></a>We'll examine that a little later but for the purposes as to whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line2717"><a name="pos2717"></a>he is to be believed as a witness on his own, we would submit </p>
<p class="line" id="line2718"><a name="pos2718"></a>that that is sufficient to approach his evidence with considerable </p>
<p class="line" id="line2719"><a name="pos2719"></a>caution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2720"><a name="pos2720"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Sorry Mr Bizos, I'm going to say something </p>
<p class="line" id="line2721"><a name="pos2721"></a>here at this stage, an observation.  We in all, almost all and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2722"><a name="pos2722"></a>perhaps all applications for amnesty, we deal with people who </p>
<p class="line" id="line2723"><a name="pos2723"></a>were convicted and who would have said, oh I didn't commit this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2724"><a name="pos2724"></a>offence, under oath and then he's obviously disbelieved and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2725"><a name="pos2725"></a>convicted.  When they make applications for amnesty we expect </p>
<p class="line" id="line2726"><a name="pos2726"></a>that they would say now I'm telling the truth, last time I lied </p>
<p class="line" id="line2727"><a name="pos2727"></a>under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2728"><a name="pos2728"></a>MR BIZOS:   I am not unmindful of the point made judge.  What I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2729"><a name="pos2729"></a>am saying is that like in the case of accomplices, we don't reject </p>
<p class="line" id="line2730"><a name="pos2730"></a>the evidence of an accomplice because he originally made the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2731"><a name="pos2731"></a>statement to the police that he didn't know anything about it, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line2732"><a name="pos2732"></a>when the matter came nearer home to him, he made to confess to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2733"><a name="pos2733"></a>the crime, but what we do require in relation to the evidence of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2734"><a name="pos2734"></a>accomplices is that because by nature they are unsatisfactory </p>
<p class="line" id="line2735"><a name="pos2735"></a>persons who were prepared to lie, we do not accept their </p>
<p class="line" id="line2736"><a name="pos2736"></a>evidence unless there are cogent reasons to do so, bearing in mind </p>
<p class="line" id="line2737"><a name="pos2737"></a>that the oath at times doesn't mean much or anything to them </p>
<p class="line" id="line2738"><a name="pos2738"></a>when their own purposes are to be served.  I do not want to take </p>
<p class="line" id="line2739"><a name="pos2739"></a>it further than that, and I would certainly not make myself guilty </p>
<p class="line" id="line2740"><a name="pos2740"></a>of submitting that because he lied nothing that he said here </p>
<p class="line" id="line2741"><a name="pos2741"></a>should be believed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2742"><a name="pos2742"></a>	What I am submitting is having regard to the fact that he is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2743"><a name="pos2743"></a>a person who was prepared to lie under oath, who said that his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2744"><a name="pos2744"></a>legal representatives were responsible for his being found guilty </p>
<p class="line" id="line2745"><a name="pos2745"></a>because they did not give him proper advice and they did not give </p>
<p class="line" id="line2746"><a name="pos2746"></a>him any reasons.  I don't want to repeat everything that he said in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2747"><a name="pos2747"></a>the application, I want to take it now further than that and most </p>
<p class="line" id="line2748"><a name="pos2748"></a>certainly do not submit that as you have indicated judged, most if </p>
<p class="line" id="line2749"><a name="pos2749"></a>not all of the people have denied it in the past particularly if they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2750"><a name="pos2750"></a>have been tried, but tremendous caution has got to be exercised </p>
<p class="line" id="line2751"><a name="pos2751"></a>in accepting the evidence of Mr Derby-Lewis so that when a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2752"><a name="pos2752"></a>member of the Committee asks a question of Counsel, where is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2753"><a name="pos2753"></a>this, merely to be pointed to a statement made by Mr Derby-Lewis </p>
<p class="line" id="line2754"><a name="pos2754"></a>without comparing that statement to what he said in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2755"><a name="pos2755"></a>application for amnesty, to what other witness have said and what </p>
<p class="line" id="line2756"><a name="pos2756"></a>the probabilities in the case are, it is not enough to merely say Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2757"><a name="pos2757"></a>Derby-Lewis and Mr Walus said.  That's as far as I want to take it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2758"><a name="pos2758"></a>and I will deal specifically in relation to some of the self-serving </p>
<p class="line" id="line2759"><a name="pos2759"></a>statements made by Mr Derby-Lewis which we will submit can not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2760"><a name="pos2760"></a>be relied upon in order to apply it as a fact and in turn apply the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2761"><a name="pos2761"></a>law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2762"><a name="pos2762"></a>	Let me deal with Mrs Derby-Lewis.  She too admitted that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2763"><a name="pos2763"></a>she lied to the Judge President of the Transvaal Provincial </p>
<p class="line" id="line2764"><a name="pos2764"></a>Division in relation to the circumstances under which the list was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2765"><a name="pos2765"></a>handed out, which is a matter on the very core of the matter.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2766"><a name="pos2766"></a>Again we cannot accept the evidence of Mrs Derby-Lewis merely </p>
<p class="line" id="line2767"><a name="pos2767"></a>because she has said so, we will have to have regard that she is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2768"><a name="pos2768"></a>person who is capable of lying under oath and who obviously has </p>
<p class="line" id="line2769"><a name="pos2769"></a>a very strong desire to get her husband's release under amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2770"><a name="pos2770"></a>	Now as far as Mr Walus is concerned, he too has </p>
<p class="line" id="line2771"><a name="pos2771"></a>contradicted himself in relation to vital matters between the notes </p>
<p class="line" id="line2772"><a name="pos2772"></a>that appear in R4 and particularly pages 362 and not the pages </p>
<p class="line" id="line2773"><a name="pos2773"></a>that have been quoted by Counsel for the applicants and also, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2774"><a name="pos2774"></a>Chairman, the issue here is not what may or may not be on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2775"><a name="pos2775"></a>tape, the vital passages that we rely on were read to Mr Walus </p>
<p class="line" id="line2776"><a name="pos2776"></a>and if you have a look at pages 98 and subsequent pages of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2777"><a name="pos2777"></a>second record, you will see that he has for all practical purposes </p>
<p class="line" id="line2778"><a name="pos2778"></a>admitted to have said the things that were recorded, but we will </p>
<p class="line" id="line2779"><a name="pos2779"></a>come to that in much greater detail.  So that again what we would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2780"><a name="pos2780"></a>appeal to the Committee to have regard to, that the matter is to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2781"><a name="pos2781"></a>be decided on with a more, with respect to Counsel for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2782"><a name="pos2782"></a>applicants, a thorough examination of the facts than they have set </p>
<p class="line" id="line2783"><a name="pos2783"></a>out in their written heads of argument and have made submissions </p>
<p class="line" id="line2784"><a name="pos2784"></a>here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2785"><a name="pos2785"></a>	The other matter Mr Chairman that we want to say about </p>
<p class="line" id="line2786"><a name="pos2786"></a>these three witnesses and in this regard I would join Mr Clarke as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2787"><a name="pos2787"></a>the fourth, because he falls into the same category that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line2788"><a name="pos2788"></a>attitude to the fundamental changes that were taking place after </p>
<p class="line" id="line2789"><a name="pos2789"></a>1990 and more particularly the preparatory changes to have a new </p>
<p class="line" id="line2790"><a name="pos2790"></a>constitution from 1993 onwards which was being prepared at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2791"><a name="pos2791"></a>CODESA was absolute anathema to them.  I do not think that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2792"><a name="pos2792"></a>will be overstating the case Mr Chairman, if they are described as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2793"><a name="pos2793"></a>a clique or small cabal of fanatics who irrespective of what the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2794"><a name="pos2794"></a>policy of their political party may have been, partly as a result of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2795"><a name="pos2795"></a>what may or may not have happened in Poland as far as Mr Walus </p>
<p class="line" id="line2796"><a name="pos2796"></a>is concerned, partly because of deeply felt and fanatical religious </p>
<p class="line" id="line2797"><a name="pos2797"></a>beliefs, they set themselves up as saviours purporting to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2798"><a name="pos2798"></a>motivated by a religion for the vast majority of the people in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2799"><a name="pos2799"></a>world preaches peace, is an excuse to commit murder by trying to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2800"><a name="pos2800"></a>persuade the committee that they were really after the Antichrist </p>
<p class="line" id="line2801"><a name="pos2801"></a>rather than the person described in evidence by Mr Jeremy Cronen </p>
<p class="line" id="line2802"><a name="pos2802"></a>as the person that had done so much in order to bring </p>
<p class="line" id="line2803"><a name="pos2803"></a>reconciliation to the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2804"><a name="pos2804"></a>	With those preliminary remarks I now want to turn Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2805"><a name="pos2805"></a>Chairman to page 1 of our written heads and there we submit at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2806"><a name="pos2806"></a>4.1 that the assassination of Mr Hani was not committed on behalf </p>
<p class="line" id="line2807"><a name="pos2807"></a>of, or in support of the Conservative Party.  And we submit that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2808"><a name="pos2808"></a>the CP had not adopted violence and most certainly not murder as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2809"><a name="pos2809"></a>one of their means to wage its political or ideological struggle </p>
<p class="line" id="line2810"><a name="pos2810"></a>against the African National Congress, its allied organisations or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2811"><a name="pos2811"></a>any other organisation.  And more particularly, and this I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2812"><a name="pos2812"></a>like to add having listened to the questions by members of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2813"><a name="pos2813"></a>committee, and particularly there was no policy of assassination </p>
<p class="line" id="line2814"><a name="pos2814"></a>of a political leader with a high profile, if you would add that on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2815"><a name="pos2815"></a>point 4.2 Mr Chairman.  With all the difficulties that we have had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2816"><a name="pos2816"></a>in our violent past, Mr Chairman, the political assassination of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2817"><a name="pos2817"></a>high profile political leaders, if not entirely unknown, was almost </p>
<p class="line" id="line2818"><a name="pos2818"></a>unknown on the South African scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2819"><a name="pos2819"></a>	It has never been suggested Mr Chairman that the killing of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2820"><a name="pos2820"></a>the President or the leader of a political party, or someone, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2821"><a name="pos2821"></a>whatever one's views may have been about their actions, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2822"><a name="pos2822"></a>country's problems would be solved by killing them.  When I say </p>
<p class="line" id="line2823"><a name="pos2823"></a>never, we of course have the notable example in this case where </p>
<p class="line" id="line2824"><a name="pos2824"></a>are going to submit it was proved that it was not only Mr Hani </p>
<p class="line" id="line2825"><a name="pos2825"></a>that was on the list for elimination but also Mr Mandela, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2826"><a name="pos2826"></a>Slovo and other political figures in the country in order to create </p>
<p class="line" id="line2827"><a name="pos2827"></a>the chaos that the two applicants have spoken of.  We submit that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2828"><a name="pos2828"></a>their act could not have been permitted in the course and scope of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2829"><a name="pos2829"></a>their duties because the CP had not advised, planned, directed, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2830"><a name="pos2830"></a>commanded or ordered assassinations as one of it's means of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2831"><a name="pos2831"></a>waging political struggle.  Mr Derby-Lewis told us what his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2832"><a name="pos2832"></a>duties were, Mr Walus hardly had any duties to perform in regard </p>
<p class="line" id="line2833"><a name="pos2833"></a>to the Conservative Party except to possibly help with elections.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2834"><a name="pos2834"></a>So that in the course and scope of their duties, advised, planned, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2835"><a name="pos2835"></a>directed or commanded or ordered by the political party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2836"><a name="pos2836"></a>	In order to answer this question we have to say, what were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2837"><a name="pos2837"></a>their duties and was it within the purview of their duty and were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2838"><a name="pos2838"></a>they ordered to do it?  One can understand Mr Chairman the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2839"><a name="pos2839"></a>security policeman who said that I was given the duty of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2840"><a name="pos2840"></a>safeguarding the security of South Africa, the politicians made </p>
<p class="line" id="line2841"><a name="pos2841"></a>the decisions that this is the society that they wanted, I was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2842"><a name="pos2842"></a>servant, my duty was to protect people.  The politicians </p>
<p class="line" id="line2843"><a name="pos2843"></a>identified, or my superiors identified Mr Goniwe to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2844"><a name="pos2844"></a>assassinated, in the furtherance of my duty, I did it.  How do </p>
<p class="line" id="line2845"><a name="pos2845"></a>these two applicants bring themselves, having regard to the duties </p>
<p class="line" id="line2846"><a name="pos2846"></a>that they had to perform, vis a vis the Conservative party into </p>
<p class="line" id="line2847"><a name="pos2847"></a>saying that it was in the course and scope of their duties as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2848"><a name="pos2848"></a>members of the CP  Mr Chairman?  There is no such evidence and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2849"><a name="pos2849"></a>in our submission the applicants haven't even applied their minds </p>
<p class="line" id="line2850"><a name="pos2850"></a>to that question and therefore on that ground amnesty should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2851"><a name="pos2851"></a>refused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2852"><a name="pos2852"></a>	But let's go further Mr Chairman; 4.4, the CP had not given </p>
<p class="line" id="line2853"><a name="pos2853"></a>any express or implied authority that assassinations of political </p>
<p class="line" id="line2854"><a name="pos2854"></a>opponents was sanctioned and you may notice Mr Chairman that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2855"><a name="pos2855"></a>we actually draw a distinction between the assassination of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2856"><a name="pos2856"></a>political opponents of high ranking and I would ask high ranking </p>
<p class="line" id="line2857"><a name="pos2857"></a>political opponents in Section 4.4 because it is in the South </p>
<p class="line" id="line2858"><a name="pos2858"></a>African context a most unusual thing.  Which national leaders of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2859"><a name="pos2859"></a>any political party have been assassinated in South Africa? </p>
<p class="line" id="line2860"><a name="pos2860"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Dr Verwoerd was wasn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2861"><a name="pos2861"></a>MR BIZOS:   Yes Dr Verwoerd was but not at the instance of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2862"><a name="pos2862"></a>political party, by a madman.  The two applicants do not contend </p>
<p class="line" id="line2863"><a name="pos2863"></a>that they were mad. I can think of no assassination of a political </p>
<p class="line" id="line2864"><a name="pos2864"></a>leader in the country at the instance of another political party Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2865"><a name="pos2865"></a>Chairman, but it may be that I had missed something along the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2866"><a name="pos2866"></a>way, I don't think I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2867"><a name="pos2867"></a>	We then go on Mr Chairman on 4.5, the applicants can not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2868"><a name="pos2868"></a>rely on any implied authority or perception that violence and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2869"><a name="pos2869"></a>more particularly a high ranking political leader, was one of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2870"><a name="pos2870"></a>means of struggle in view of the standing within the CP of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2871"><a name="pos2871"></a>second applicant and the close association between the two </p>
<p class="line" id="line2872"><a name="pos2872"></a>applicants who are clearly on their evidence co-conspirators </p>
<p class="line" id="line2873"><a name="pos2873"></a>rather than inciter and incite.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2874"><a name="pos2874"></a>	Now again Mr Chairman, where did they get this authority </p>
<p class="line" id="line2875"><a name="pos2875"></a>from, we have and particularly on the section of the argument </p>
<p class="line" id="line2876"><a name="pos2876"></a>that is going to be dealt with by my learned colleague, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2877"><a name="pos2877"></a>Malindi, we will give the Committee the references Mr Chairman </p>
<p class="line" id="line2878"><a name="pos2878"></a>where this is documented, we believe that there can be no real </p>
<p class="line" id="line2879"><a name="pos2879"></a>answer to the evidence that came to Dr Hartzenberg himself, from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2880"><a name="pos2880"></a>the other leaders of the Conservative Party and we will submit Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2881"><a name="pos2881"></a>Chairman in so far as credibility is concerned that Dr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2882"><a name="pos2882"></a>Hartzenberg's responses in relation to violence to Mr Venter, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2883"><a name="pos2883"></a>what the Committee should accept as the truth and not the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2884"><a name="pos2884"></a>pathetic figure that Mr Hartzenberg cut when he gave evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line2885"><a name="pos2885"></a>before the Committee trying to explain this.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2886"><a name="pos2886"></a>	Let me just say briefly Mr Chairman that for him to have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2887"><a name="pos2887"></a>said that -</p>
<p class="line" id="line2888"><a name="pos2888"></a> "I as the deputy leader said a few days after the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2889"><a name="pos2889"></a>murder that we were the people with the moral high </p>
<p class="line" id="line2890"><a name="pos2890"></a>ground, we did not use violence, nor assassination..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line2891"><a name="pos2891"></a>to come here and try and excuse it on the basis that political </p>
<p class="line" id="line2892"><a name="pos2892"></a>leaders would not come out with it openly, is a pathetic attempt </p>
<p class="line" id="line2893"><a name="pos2893"></a>by a discredited politician to help one of his fellow party members </p>
<p class="line" id="line2894"><a name="pos2894"></a>of a discredited political party out of the difficulty in getting </p>
<p class="line" id="line2895"><a name="pos2895"></a>amnesty.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2896"><a name="pos2896"></a>	And what we submit in 4.6 Mr Chairman or 4.5, we will </p>
<p class="line" id="line2897"><a name="pos2897"></a>refer to the passages and there isn't only one, such passage, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line2898"><a name="pos2898"></a>particularly one of the  passages in answer to the committee </p>
<p class="line" id="line2899"><a name="pos2899"></a>member Advocate Potgieter which makes it quite clear on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2900"><a name="pos2900"></a>evidence of both of them that they were co-conspirators planning </p>
<p class="line" id="line2901"><a name="pos2901"></a>this together and there was no element of inciter and incitee. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2902"><a name="pos2902"></a>	We draw attention Mr Chairman that the word order was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2903"><a name="pos2903"></a>introduced into Mr Derby-Lewis' vocabulary after the Max du </p>
<p class="line" id="line2904"><a name="pos2904"></a>Preez show was shown to him where Mr du Preez offered some </p>
<p class="line" id="line2905"><a name="pos2905"></a>legal advice which he took with both hands, not legal advice - </p>
<p class="line" id="line2906"><a name="pos2906"></a>offered the possibility that Walus may have an additional defence, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2907"><a name="pos2907"></a>that it was taken with both hands and Counsel for the applicants </p>
<p class="line" id="line2908"><a name="pos2908"></a>used the word order intermittently in the heads of argument </p>
<p class="line" id="line2909"><a name="pos2909"></a>without having regard to the evidence that there was this co-</p>
<p class="line" id="line2910"><a name="pos2910"></a>conspiratorial relationship rather than the one of inciter and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2911"><a name="pos2911"></a>incitee.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2912"><a name="pos2912"></a>	And we say in 4.6 that there are no reasonable grounds </p>
<p class="line" id="line2913"><a name="pos2913"></a>upon which the applicants can claim that they believed themselves </p>
<p class="line" id="line2914"><a name="pos2914"></a>to be acting in the course and scope of their duties, and within </p>
<p class="line" id="line2915"><a name="pos2915"></a>the scope of their express or implied authority, we will rely </p>
<p class="line" id="line2916"><a name="pos2916"></a>heavily upon the position of Mr Derby-Lewis' in the Conservative </p>
<p class="line" id="line2917"><a name="pos2917"></a>Party and if Mr Walus was a co-conspirator and not an incitee </p>
<p class="line" id="line2918"><a name="pos2918"></a>then it would follow in his case as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2919"><a name="pos2919"></a>	But there is an overwhelming probability that people as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2920"><a name="pos2920"></a>close to one another as this, and we submit that Mr Walus would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2921"><a name="pos2921"></a>not have given the Committee an impression that he's a weakling </p>
<p class="line" id="line2922"><a name="pos2922"></a>or a yes-man to anybody's will.  He bragged about his prowess in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2923"><a name="pos2923"></a>the statement recorded by Mr Deetliefs and Mr Beetge and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2924"><a name="pos2924"></a>nothing in his demeanour or in his actions or his absence of any </p>
<p class="line" id="line2925"><a name="pos2925"></a>remorse on his part and the manner in which he dealt with himself </p>
<p class="line" id="line2926"><a name="pos2926"></a>in this court, that before this Committee, thus could not have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2927"><a name="pos2927"></a>given the impression that he's a weak person that was mislead by </p>
<p class="line" id="line2928"><a name="pos2928"></a>Mr Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2929"><a name="pos2929"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Mr Bizos, has the Act been amended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2930"><a name="pos2930"></a>MR BIZOS:   Yes it has Mr Chairman and I have a note at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2931"><a name="pos2931"></a>bottom of it by my attorney who's copy I have but she obviously </p>
<p class="line" id="line2932"><a name="pos2932"></a>checked it that a. deleted by the - I may say Mr Chairman that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2933"><a name="pos2933"></a>once Judge Wilson raises it, I hadn't looked at it before until </p>
<p class="line" id="line2934"><a name="pos2934"></a>Judge Wilson read it, I have not made up my mind finally and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2935"><a name="pos2935"></a>have to do something tonight in order to make what we hope to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2936"><a name="pos2936"></a>be meaningful submissions or as to what it's effect may or may </p>
<p class="line" id="line2937"><a name="pos2937"></a>not be on this application and we are indebted that it was drawn </p>
<p class="line" id="line2938"><a name="pos2938"></a>to our attention so that we can deal with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2939"><a name="pos2939"></a>	Then we say in paragraph 4.7. the offence was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2940"><a name="pos2940"></a>committed in the course of or as part of a political uprising, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2941"><a name="pos2941"></a>disturbance or event or in reaction thereto as that the time of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2942"><a name="pos2942"></a>negotiations had reached and advanced stage and a peaceful </p>
<p class="line" id="line2943"><a name="pos2943"></a>solution to the country's problems was in sight.  Now I want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2944"><a name="pos2944"></a>make clear Mr Chairman that we submit that the conflicts of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2945"><a name="pos2945"></a>past were coming to an end.  Counsel for the applicants said but </p>
<p class="line" id="line2946"><a name="pos2946"></a>look what Mr Visser told us that Gen Viljoen was planning, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2947"><a name="pos2947"></a>was, we submit, clearly a conditional possibility, if there was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2948"><a name="pos2948"></a>a settlement.  As it turned out, General Viljoen himself subscribed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2949"><a name="pos2949"></a>to the settlement, therefore what might have happened according </p>
<p class="line" id="line2950"><a name="pos2950"></a>to the plans of the Volksfront at that stage which were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2951"><a name="pos2951"></a>publicly known for which the applicants do not purport to have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2952"><a name="pos2952"></a>been acting on behalf of, can be left out of account, we submit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2953"><a name="pos2953"></a>	What is relevant and the evidence stands uncontradicted, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2954"><a name="pos2954"></a>was put down in a written statement supported by annexures </p>
<p class="line" id="line2955"><a name="pos2955"></a>which are before you as Exhibit, it's Bundle B which contains, it's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2956"><a name="pos2956"></a>a carefully prepared statement and practically all the statements </p>
<p class="line" id="line2957"><a name="pos2957"></a>in it are supported by  what Mr Jeremy Cronin now says Mr Chris </p>
<p class="line" id="line2958"><a name="pos2958"></a>Hani said at the time, but we were careful to go to the public </p>
<p class="line" id="line2959"><a name="pos2959"></a>record as to what Mr Hani was saying at the time and what he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2960"><a name="pos2960"></a>was saying was obviously gaining ground and obviously not to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2961"><a name="pos2961"></a>liking of the fanatics like the two applicants, Mrs Derby-Lewis </p>
<p class="line" id="line2962"><a name="pos2962"></a>and Mr Clarke.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2963"><a name="pos2963"></a>	And it is that, and when their party in April 1993 was party </p>
<p class="line" id="line2964"><a name="pos2964"></a>to those negotiations, Mr Chairman, how could they believe that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2965"><a name="pos2965"></a>killing one of the negotiators and the general secretary of one of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2966"><a name="pos2966"></a>the negotiating parties at that process where their own party was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2967"><a name="pos2967"></a>participating be in the course and scope of their duties or that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2968"><a name="pos2968"></a>they had the express or implied authority?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2969"><a name="pos2969"></a>	It can be tested in this way Mr Chairman, there was Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2970"><a name="pos2970"></a>Langley there if I remember correctly, there was Mr Hartzenberg </p>
<p class="line" id="line2971"><a name="pos2971"></a>there, pride of place for the television cameras of the world </p>
<p class="line" id="line2972"><a name="pos2972"></a>negotiating for a settlement, these applicants say that whilst they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2973"><a name="pos2973"></a>were in CODESA negotiating a settlement, these two gentlemen </p>
<p class="line" id="line2974"><a name="pos2974"></a>believed that they had express or implied authority from them to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2975"><a name="pos2975"></a>kill on of the top leaders of the alliance working to bring about </p>
<p class="line" id="line2976"><a name="pos2976"></a>democratic changes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2977"><a name="pos2977"></a>	Again Mr Chairman, I must refer to these four, and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2978"><a name="pos2978"></a>include Mr Clarke, to this day Mr Chairman they speak about a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2979"><a name="pos2979"></a>communist party take-over.  They do not accept that we had a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2980"><a name="pos2980"></a>democratic election.  To them democracy means something else </p>
<p class="line" id="line2981"><a name="pos2981"></a>entirely.  I mention this because we will make some references to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2982"><a name="pos2982"></a>it in greater detail as to whether reconciliation is about to take </p>
<p class="line" id="line2983"><a name="pos2983"></a>place by people who still speak about a communist take-over </p>
<p class="line" id="line2984"><a name="pos2984"></a>when 62 or 63% of the population of this county voted for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2985"><a name="pos2985"></a>government that is in power.  They may be fanatics, they may be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2986"><a name="pos2986"></a>unreasonable, they may be beyond the pale, but none of those </p>
<p class="line" id="line2987"><a name="pos2987"></a>entitle them to say that they believed that they had express or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2988"><a name="pos2988"></a>implied authority.  There was nothing happening at the time to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2989"><a name="pos2989"></a>which they had to react by killing a top leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2990"><a name="pos2990"></a>	Then we say in 4.8 Mr Chairman that the Act was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2991"><a name="pos2991"></a>proportional to the objective pursued in their own version and on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2992"><a name="pos2992"></a>their own version they sought to create chaos, expecting hundreds </p>
<p class="line" id="line2993"><a name="pos2993"></a>if not thousands of people to be killed during a race war in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2994"><a name="pos2994"></a>hope that the riot would stage a coup.  This has been canvassed, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2995"><a name="pos2995"></a>do not want to take up very much more time on it at this stage, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2996"><a name="pos2996"></a>was very important for the proportionality.  But I was actually </p>
<p class="line" id="line2997"><a name="pos2997"></a>somewhat surprised by the Counsel for the applicant, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2998"><a name="pos2998"></a>Chairman that the killing of Pieterse led to chaos.  I don't know </p>
<p class="line" id="line2999"><a name="pos2999"></a>why he said that, I would have thought that that would have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line3000"><a name="pos3000"></a>a warning to his client about irrational killing of people because </p>
<p class="line" id="line3001"><a name="pos3001"></a>we know that hundreds if not thousands died as a direct or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3002"><a name="pos3002"></a>indirect result of the wanton killing of Master Petersen on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3003"><a name="pos3003"></a>16th of June 1976.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3004"><a name="pos3004"></a>	And in 4.9 Mr Chairman the relationship between the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3005"><a name="pos3005"></a>objective pursued and the act is director or proximate, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3006"><a name="pos3006"></a>particularly as on their own version they had not planned or even </p>
<p class="line" id="line3007"><a name="pos3007"></a>informed the CP who they claim to have represented or any </p>
<p class="line" id="line3008"><a name="pos3008"></a>elements, to any elements of the right.  I think that the members </p>
<p class="line" id="line3009"><a name="pos3009"></a>of the Committee are aware to what we are referring to in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3010"><a name="pos3010"></a>regard and I will take it no further at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3011"><a name="pos3011"></a>	Now in relation to full disclosure Mr Chairman, we submit </p>
<p class="line" id="line3012"><a name="pos3012"></a>that the applicants have not made a full disclosure of all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3013"><a name="pos3013"></a>relevant facts and have been untruthful relating to when the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3014"><a name="pos3014"></a>conspiracy to kill Chris Hani was first mooted or entered into; </p>
<p class="line" id="line3015"><a name="pos3015"></a>who were the victims of the conspiracy; who had become members </p>
<p class="line" id="line3016"><a name="pos3016"></a>of the conspiracy and more particularly Mrs Gaye Derby-Lewis </p>
<p class="line" id="line3017"><a name="pos3017"></a>and others who had procured the murder weapon; who procured </p>
<p class="line" id="line3018"><a name="pos3018"></a>the murder weapon and the reasons thereof.  Details of this are </p>
<p class="line" id="line3019"><a name="pos3019"></a>given in the rest of the heads of argument.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3020"><a name="pos3020"></a>	It is further submitted that the grant of amnesty to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3021"><a name="pos3021"></a>applicants would be inappropriate and not in accordance with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3022"><a name="pos3022"></a>objective of the Commission to promote national unity and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3023"><a name="pos3023"></a>reconciliation in that the act or offence was committed during the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3024"><a name="pos3024"></a>time when the country was at its most sensitive stage towards </p>
<p class="line" id="line3025"><a name="pos3025"></a>building peace, reconciliation and democracy.  The offence was of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3026"><a name="pos3026"></a>such gravity that the chaos envisaged to result from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3027"><a name="pos3027"></a>assassination could have led to the death of many innocent </p>
<p class="line" id="line3028"><a name="pos3028"></a>civilians.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3029"><a name="pos3029"></a>	Well may I pause here and again refer to the evidence of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3030"><a name="pos3030"></a>Jeremy Cronin as to how near we were to a civil war and the real </p>
<p class="line" id="line3031"><a name="pos3031"></a>chaos that had been envisaged and the evidence that had it not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3032"><a name="pos3032"></a>been for the leadership of Mr Mandela then as President of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3033"><a name="pos3033"></a>ANC and Mr Tokyo Sexwale as the Transvaal Chairman of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3034"><a name="pos3034"></a>ANC, there would so easily have been a blood bath and a race war </p>
<p class="line" id="line3035"><a name="pos3035"></a>in South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3036"><a name="pos3036"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:  Mr Bizos I do not understand the first </p>
<p class="line" id="line3037"><a name="pos3037"></a>sentence in that sub paragraph.  The second one I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line3038"><a name="pos3038"></a>understand provided it still deals with the question of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3039"><a name="pos3039"></a>proportionality and therefore that it's not a new argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3040"><a name="pos3040"></a>MR BIZOS:  Yes the sentences should have been the other way </p>
<p class="line" id="line3041"><a name="pos3041"></a>around, it's not an argument, it's a fact supporting the argument </p>
<p class="line" id="line3042"><a name="pos3042"></a>appearing in the second sentence.  Or have I misunderstood the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3043"><a name="pos3043"></a>question?  Are we talking about the first sentence of 5.1</p>
<p class="line" id="line3044"><a name="pos3044"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3045"><a name="pos3045"></a>MR BIZOS:   And is that compared to some other sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3046"><a name="pos3046"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   No reading it on it's own, it somewhat </p>
<p class="line" id="line3047"><a name="pos3047"></a>surprises me because well in conjunction with the introductory </p>
<p class="line" id="line3048"><a name="pos3048"></a>part which is 5.5, and if you read 5 and then you say 5.1, you say </p>
<p class="line" id="line3049"><a name="pos3049"></a>that the grant of amnesty to the applicants will be inappropriate </p>
<p class="line" id="line3050"><a name="pos3050"></a>and not in accordance with objectives of the Commission to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3051"><a name="pos3051"></a>promote national unity and reconciliation in that the act or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3052"><a name="pos3052"></a>offence was committed...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3053"><a name="pos3053"></a>MR BIZOS:   I can see that, it's confused thinking with respect </p>
<p class="line" id="line3054"><a name="pos3054"></a>and I'm sorry for it.  There are really two separate issues; when </p>
<p class="line" id="line3055"><a name="pos3055"></a>was it committed, and under what circumstances and that is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3056"><a name="pos3056"></a>proportionality argument, the other is should it be granted </p>
<p class="line" id="line3057"><a name="pos3057"></a>because of - and they are really separate points, I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3058"><a name="pos3058"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   And them being separate points, why would </p>
<p class="line" id="line3059"><a name="pos3059"></a>they - if requirements are met, if prescribed requirements for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3060"><a name="pos3060"></a>amnesty are met, why should we refuse the applicants amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line3061"><a name="pos3061"></a>simply because at that stage, simply because the offence was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3062"><a name="pos3062"></a>committed at the time when the country was at a sensitive stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3063"><a name="pos3063"></a>MR BIZOS:  That is why I say it's not a separate ground, it's </p>
<p class="line" id="line3064"><a name="pos3064"></a>ground supporting the proportionality argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3065"><a name="pos3065"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Thank you that's understandable, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3066"><a name="pos3066"></a>MR BIZOS:   Probably if it had been more fully drafted it would </p>
<p class="line" id="line3067"><a name="pos3067"></a>have been more - it's more appropriate to the proportionality </p>
<p class="line" id="line3068"><a name="pos3068"></a>argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3069"><a name="pos3069"></a>	And in 5.2 according to the applicants, the struggle </p>
<p class="line" id="line3070"><a name="pos3070"></a>continues and it cannot be discounted that they remain committed </p>
<p class="line" id="line3071"><a name="pos3071"></a>to the objective of creating large scale chaos which will create </p>
<p class="line" id="line3072"><a name="pos3072"></a>conditions for a coup d'etat and this is what it was Mr Chairman, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3073"><a name="pos3073"></a>this was an attempt on their own version, and attempt at coup </p>
<p class="line" id="line3074"><a name="pos3074"></a>d'etat and may I add here that nobody articulated more practically </p>
<p class="line" id="line3075"><a name="pos3075"></a>than Mr Clarke that we had here yesterday.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3076"><a name="pos3076"></a>	Perhaps if the Committee would allow me a personal </p>
<p class="line" id="line3077"><a name="pos3077"></a>observation, the applicants and their counsel thought the world of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3078"><a name="pos3078"></a>Mr Clarke as a witness, we submit that he is so besotted by </p>
<p class="line" id="line3079"><a name="pos3079"></a>hatred purporting to be a fundamentalist Christian, so besotted </p>
<p class="line" id="line3080"><a name="pos3080"></a>with hatred and admiration for the two murderers applying for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3081"><a name="pos3081"></a>amnesty that I would suggest that there is very ....(tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3082"><a name="pos3082"></a>.. it doesn't appear in the heads of argument elsewhere,  I might </p>
<p class="line" id="line3083"><a name="pos3083"></a>as well deal with it at this stage Mr Chairman even though I'm on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3084"><a name="pos3084"></a>an overview.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3085"><a name="pos3085"></a>	Counsel for the applicants dismiss the evidence of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3086"><a name="pos3086"></a>Visser as fanciful and self-serving.  Yes it may well be but there </p>
<p class="line" id="line3087"><a name="pos3087"></a>are two inherent improbabilities in Mr Clarke's evidence who </p>
<p class="line" id="line3088"><a name="pos3088"></a>denies that anything like that happened. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3089"><a name="pos3089"></a>	Firstly why should Mr Visser have gone to Mr Clarke and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3090"><a name="pos3090"></a>asked Mr Clarke and Mr Roodt to apply for amnesty?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3091"><a name="pos3091"></a>	Secondly, if Mr Clarke is telling the truth that Mr Visser </p>
<p class="line" id="line3092"><a name="pos3092"></a>was, he's the fault ..(indistinct) and that the relationship between </p>
<p class="line" id="line3093"><a name="pos3093"></a>the two of them had soured by the time of the commission of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3094"><a name="pos3094"></a>murder, why Mr Clarke on his own version disclosed to Mr Visser </p>
<p class="line" id="line3095"><a name="pos3095"></a>that there was compromising information in his computer's hard </p>
<p class="line" id="line3096"><a name="pos3096"></a>disks?  Since when on the general and particular probabilities </p>
<p class="line" id="line3097"><a name="pos3097"></a>does a witness confide that sort of information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3098"><a name="pos3098"></a>	 If we turn to paragraph 5 of page 3 Mr Chairman: </p>
<p class="line" id="line3099"><a name="pos3099"></a>	"It is further submitted that the grant of amnesty to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3100"><a name="pos3100"></a>applicants will be inappropriate and not in accordance with </p>
<p class="line" id="line3101"><a name="pos3101"></a>the objective of the Commission to promote National unity </p>
<p class="line" id="line3102"><a name="pos3102"></a>and reconciliation in that the offence was committed during </p>
<p class="line" id="line3103"><a name="pos3103"></a>the time when the country was at the most sensitive stage </p>
<p class="line" id="line3104"><a name="pos3104"></a>with the building of peace, reconciliation and democracy, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3105"><a name="pos3105"></a>the offence was of such a gravity that the chaos envisaged </p>
<p class="line" id="line3106"><a name="pos3106"></a>to result from the assassination would have led to the death </p>
<p class="line" id="line3107"><a name="pos3107"></a>of many innocent civilians.  According to the applicants the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3108"><a name="pos3108"></a>struggle continues and it cannot be discounted that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3109"><a name="pos3109"></a>remain committed with the objective of creating large scale </p>
<p class="line" id="line3110"><a name="pos3110"></a>chaos which will create conditions for a coup d'etat".</p>
<p class="line" id="line3111"><a name="pos3111"></a>	But now Mr Chairman, amnesty is provided in relation in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3112"><a name="pos3112"></a>relation to coup d'etat in paragraph E and by the usual argument </p>
<p class="line" id="line3113"><a name="pos3113"></a>of that which included excludes other possibilities.  It was only </p>
<p class="line" id="line3114"><a name="pos3114"></a>amnesty to be given any person in the performance of a coup </p>
<p class="line" id="line3115"><a name="pos3115"></a>d'etat to take over the government of any former state or any </p>
<p class="line" id="line3116"><a name="pos3116"></a>attempt thereto.  So this was a coup d'etat, it was not for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3117"><a name="pos3117"></a>purposes of preserving law and order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3118"><a name="pos3118"></a>	We turn in paragraph 6 to  6.1:  The failure to make full </p>
<p class="line" id="line3119"><a name="pos3119"></a>disclosures.  We submit that Mr Derby-Lewis has lied about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3120"><a name="pos3120"></a>involvement of Mrs Derby-Lewis in the compilation of the hit list </p>
<p class="line" id="line3121"><a name="pos3121"></a>and the reasons therefor.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3122"><a name="pos3122"></a>	Derby-Lewis testified that he first saw the list of the nine </p>
<p class="line" id="line3123"><a name="pos3123"></a>names in Cape Town when Mrs Derby-Lewis showed it to him as </p>
<p class="line" id="line3124"><a name="pos3124"></a>part of the gravy train story which was to be used by Dr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3125"><a name="pos3125"></a>Hartzenberg in Parliament. We submit that that's false Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3126"><a name="pos3126"></a>Chairman. This could not be true because in January 1993 when </p>
<p class="line" id="line3127"><a name="pos3127"></a>Mrs Derby-Lewis telephoned Arthur Kemp and sent him a list of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3128"><a name="pos3128"></a>90 names it was after she and Derby-Lewis had discussed it and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3129"><a name="pos3129"></a>decided that unless something dramatic was done the country </p>
<p class="line" id="line3130"><a name="pos3130"></a>would be controlled by a communist.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3131"><a name="pos3131"></a>"Clive and I therefore highlighted the names of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3132"><a name="pos3132"></a>people whom we believed to be the enemies of South </p>
<p class="line" id="line3133"><a name="pos3133"></a>Africa".  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3134"><a name="pos3134"></a>	This comes in R4.251, paragraph 43.1, we are going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3135"><a name="pos3135"></a>argue Mr Chairman in due course that their statements are </p>
<p class="line" id="line3136"><a name="pos3136"></a>admissible as the ruling of the Committee indicated and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3137"><a name="pos3137"></a>weight should be attached to it.  We will refer you, not to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3138"><a name="pos3138"></a>generalities or the cross-examination put to Mr De Waal, but to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3139"><a name="pos3139"></a>her own statements that she is unable to deny that this is what she </p>
<p class="line" id="line3140"><a name="pos3140"></a>said and that she made that freely and voluntarily despite certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line3141"><a name="pos3141"></a>discomforts that she says she suffered under. If that statement of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3142"><a name="pos3142"></a>Mrs Derby-Lewis is admitted and what we say is that we must </p>
<p class="line" id="line3143"><a name="pos3143"></a>take it together with the probabilities; the probabilities of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3144"><a name="pos3144"></a>close union between these two persons and having regard to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3145"><a name="pos3145"></a>character of Mrs Derby-Lewis, we are not dealing here with a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3146"><a name="pos3146"></a>compliant housewife, we are dealing with a high profile </p>
<p class="line" id="line3147"><a name="pos3147"></a>propagandist in the Patriot who in her exaggerations and fanatical </p>
<p class="line" id="line3148"><a name="pos3148"></a>statements probably has no equal and who has a mind of her own. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3149"><a name="pos3149"></a> No serious step in relation to the preparation of this list would </p>
<p class="line" id="line3150"><a name="pos3150"></a>have been without her consent, and what we say at the bottom of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3151"><a name="pos3151"></a>page 4, 'on 29 April 1993 whilst in detention, Mrs Derby-Lewis </p>
<p class="line" id="line3152"><a name="pos3152"></a>was shown three pages compiled as the hit list and recognised </p>
<p class="line" id="line3153"><a name="pos3153"></a>them as the list of names and addresses that she had given to her </p>
<p class="line" id="line3154"><a name="pos3154"></a>husband.  This is evidence that Mrs Derby-Lewis knew of what </p>
<p class="line" id="line3155"><a name="pos3155"></a>purpose Mr Derby-Lewis needed the list.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3156"><a name="pos3156"></a>	Of course Mr Chairman, I'll remind you at this stage that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3157"><a name="pos3157"></a>she denied flatly before the Judge President of the Transvaal as it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3158"><a name="pos3158"></a>was then known, that she had given the list to anyone, she made </p>
<p class="line" id="line3159"><a name="pos3159"></a>up a fabric of lies about it being left on her coffee table with </p>
<p class="line" id="line3160"><a name="pos3160"></a>copies of the Patriot which Mr Walus may have mistakenly taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3161"><a name="pos3161"></a>	When Mrs Derby-Lewis compiled the original list of 19 </p>
<p class="line" id="line3162"><a name="pos3162"></a>names, she knew that the people whom she and Derby-Lewis </p>
<p class="line" id="line3163"><a name="pos3163"></a>considered to be enemies of South Africa were to be murdered, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3164"><a name="pos3164"></a>that after she had received the list of 9 names, Chris Hani was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3165"><a name="pos3165"></a>targeted for elimination, that the houses of the people identified </p>
<p class="line" id="line3166"><a name="pos3166"></a>for elimination would be reconnoitred and that Walus the one who </p>
<p class="line" id="line3167"><a name="pos3167"></a>was going to assassinate Chris Hani and we give you the passages </p>
<p class="line" id="line3168"><a name="pos3168"></a>in R4 Mr Chairman.  When cross-examined on why she needed </p>
<p class="line" id="line3169"><a name="pos3169"></a>addresses of certain people that she could either telephone or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3170"><a name="pos3170"></a>visit their offices, Mrs Derby-Lewis gave some preposterous </p>
<p class="line" id="line3171"><a name="pos3171"></a>answers.  Although she didn't think Hani would give her a private </p>
<p class="line" id="line3172"><a name="pos3172"></a>interview in his home, she still wanted the address so that she </p>
<p class="line" id="line3173"><a name="pos3173"></a>could see the way he lived.  The answer is absurd, if she was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3174"><a name="pos3174"></a>going to be allowed into the house in the first place.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3175"><a name="pos3175"></a>	Mrs Derby-Lewis gave totally unsatisfactory and evasive </p>
<p class="line" id="line3176"><a name="pos3176"></a>answers to members of the Committee Mr Chairman about why </p>
<p class="line" id="line3177"><a name="pos3177"></a>she would have wanted to interview certain people who appear on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3178"><a name="pos3178"></a>the list and as to why she didn't visit certain journalists or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3179"><a name="pos3179"></a>telephoned them at their homes instead of seeking their addresses </p>
<p class="line" id="line3180"><a name="pos3180"></a>through Mr Kemp.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3181"><a name="pos3181"></a>	We give you the references; it was a long exchange Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3182"><a name="pos3182"></a>Chairman and we submit that it bristles with improbabilities.  It is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3183"><a name="pos3183"></a>submitted that the reason she has for compiling the list be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3184"><a name="pos3184"></a>rejected and that it be found that the list was compiled as a hit </p>
<p class="line" id="line3185"><a name="pos3185"></a>list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3186"><a name="pos3186"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   The one thing that sometimes worries me </p>
<p class="line" id="line3187"><a name="pos3187"></a>about this is, why if people are busy carefully planning the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3188"><a name="pos3188"></a>assassination of others, why would they make a list and in fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line3189"><a name="pos3189"></a>bandy it around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3190"><a name="pos3190"></a>MR BIZOS:   Well I can venture a number of reasonable </p>
<p class="line" id="line3191"><a name="pos3191"></a>possibilities as to why they would do that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3192"><a name="pos3192"></a>	First of all, either at the time that they were doing the list </p>
<p class="line" id="line3193"><a name="pos3193"></a>or before that they had hoped that more people would come into </p>
<p class="line" id="line3194"><a name="pos3194"></a>the conspiracy and it may be that they wanted to show them, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3195"><a name="pos3195"></a>these are the enemies of the Afrikaner Volk, these are the people </p>
<p class="line" id="line3196"><a name="pos3196"></a>that we must eliminate.  They wanted an order and in answer to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3197"><a name="pos3197"></a>Judge Wilson as to why Walus marked it 1 to 9, is a ridiculous </p>
<p class="line" id="line3198"><a name="pos3198"></a>answer, with respect.  You'll recall that it was in order to speak </p>
<p class="line" id="line3199"><a name="pos3199"></a>on the telephone by number, and I think it was the chairperson </p>
<p class="line" id="line3200"><a name="pos3200"></a>that asked well if there was only going to be one, why talk in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3201"><a name="pos3201"></a>numbers anyway? So that a list is some evidence that this was or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3202"><a name="pos3202"></a>was intended to be a wider conspiracy than we have heard of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3203"><a name="pos3203"></a>here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3204"><a name="pos3204"></a>	The other of course is, criminal investigators in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3205"><a name="pos3205"></a>administration of justice thrive on it.  Many of the people that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3206"><a name="pos3206"></a>plan similar crimes are just stupid.  In the Goniwe matter they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3207"><a name="pos3207"></a>dropped a name plate, otherwise the Goniwe people would just </p>
<p class="line" id="line3208"><a name="pos3208"></a>have disappeared for ever.  It is the sort of thing, the sort of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3209"><a name="pos3209"></a>oversight or the sort of conduct which makes investigation </p>
<p class="line" id="line3210"><a name="pos3210"></a>possible.  But certainly what it is not, is a list for journalistic </p>
<p class="line" id="line3211"><a name="pos3211"></a>purposes because we have the evidence of  Mrs Derby-Lewis in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3212"><a name="pos3212"></a>the criminal trial.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3213"><a name="pos3213"></a>	We will refer you to the passage Mr Chairman where His </p>
<p class="line" id="line3214"><a name="pos3214"></a>Lordship Mr Justice Eloff holds the evidence to be highly </p>
<p class="line" id="line3215"><a name="pos3215"></a>improbable.  However in that criminal trial there was an onus </p>
<p class="line" id="line3216"><a name="pos3216"></a>which had to be discharged and probabilities were not enough.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3217"><a name="pos3217"></a>The Committee here, and this is why she could not be convicted </p>
<p class="line" id="line3218"><a name="pos3218"></a>on the second count of conspiring to kill the people on the list, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3219"><a name="pos3219"></a>but here we had the additional evidence, their own statements, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line3220"><a name="pos3220"></a>have the evidence here of what Mr Derby-Lewis admits to doing </p>
<p class="line" id="line3221"><a name="pos3221"></a>which was not before His Lordship Mr Justice Eloff and I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line3222"><a name="pos3222"></a>submit that although the Committee will accept the learned </p>
<p class="line" id="line3223"><a name="pos3223"></a>Judge's view that it was highly improbable, what has come forth </p>
<p class="line" id="line3224"><a name="pos3224"></a>since, that Mr Derby-Lewis indeed had this list, that he did get it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3225"><a name="pos3225"></a>from his wife, that he did give it to Walus, that he and Walus, on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3226"><a name="pos3226"></a>their own version had planned the assassination, so that claiming </p>
<p class="line" id="line3227"><a name="pos3227"></a>that this was an innocent list on the probabilities was unlikely for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3228"><a name="pos3228"></a>Judge Eloff correctly, for this Committee it is beyond reasonable </p>
<p class="line" id="line3229"><a name="pos3229"></a>doubt.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3230"><a name="pos3230"></a>	That is the submission that we make in relation to the list </p>
<p class="line" id="line3231"><a name="pos3231"></a>and Mr Derby-Lewis lied about it, Mr Walus lied about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3232"><a name="pos3232"></a>purpose of the list, Mrs Derby-Lewis lied in relation to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3233"><a name="pos3233"></a>purposes of the list.  Therefore in relation to lack of full </p>
<p class="line" id="line3234"><a name="pos3234"></a>disclosure, if our submission is well-founded that all three of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3235"><a name="pos3235"></a>them knew that there were to be more than one victim and at least </p>
<p class="line" id="line3236"><a name="pos3236"></a>another appears in the list of nine, then each one of them has </p>
<p class="line" id="line3237"><a name="pos3237"></a>failed to disclose the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3238"><a name="pos3238"></a>	Let us take it on the probabilities.  After all we only have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3239"><a name="pos3239"></a>the wrong-doers testimony to work on and it may well be that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3240"><a name="pos3240"></a>none of them was expressly prepared to say or Walus was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3241"><a name="pos3241"></a>prepared to say that I knew that this was drawn up by Mrs Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line3242"><a name="pos3242"></a>Lewis and I knew that it was a hit list for the nine, if the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3243"><a name="pos3243"></a>inference can be drawn, and we submit clearly that it can, that all </p>
<p class="line" id="line3244"><a name="pos3244"></a>three of them knew what they were doing and what they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3245"><a name="pos3245"></a>saying about the nine people on the list, there has not been full </p>
<p class="line" id="line3246"><a name="pos3246"></a>disclosure, that neither of them is entitled to amnesty and it is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3247"><a name="pos3247"></a>pity that the safeguards of double jeopardy, Mrs Derby-Lewis </p>
<p class="line" id="line3248"><a name="pos3248"></a>does not have to answer any more to Mr Hani's death in a court </p>
<p class="line" id="line3249"><a name="pos3249"></a>of law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3250"><a name="pos3250"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Another possibility could well be is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3251"><a name="pos3251"></a>initially the list was sought for the purpose that we are told it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3252"><a name="pos3252"></a>was sought for and then later however, certain names were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3253"><a name="pos3253"></a>identified from it for purposes of elimination, which does not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3254"><a name="pos3254"></a>destroy the original purpose for which the list was sought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3255"><a name="pos3255"></a>MR BIZOS:   Although that is a theoretical possibility, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3256"><a name="pos3256"></a>admissions of Mrs Derby-Lewis in R4 exclude it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3257"><a name="pos3257"></a>because she says, I can read the passages now - 251 </p>
<p class="line" id="line3258"><a name="pos3258"></a>of R4 Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3259"><a name="pos3259"></a>"In January 1963 I telephoned Arthur Kemp at the</p>
<p class="line" id="line3260"><a name="pos3260"></a>Citizen in Johannesburg and said I was going to send</p>
<p class="line" id="line3261"><a name="pos3261"></a>him a list of names and that I wanted a description of</p>
<p class="line" id="line3262"><a name="pos3262"></a>their houses and addresses.  This was done after much </p>
<p class="line" id="line3263"><a name="pos3263"></a>serious thought and because Clive and I felt that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3264"><a name="pos3264"></a>unless something dramatic was done the country </p>
<p class="line" id="line3265"><a name="pos3265"></a>would be controlled by the communists".</p>
<p class="line" id="line3266"><a name="pos3266"></a>		Now may I just for one moment deal with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3267"><a name="pos3267"></a>question of admissibility and weight at this stage?  This is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3268"><a name="pos3268"></a>completely consistent with what all of them said.  So how </p>
<p class="line" id="line3269"><a name="pos3269"></a>does it help the applicants to say that words were put into </p>
<p class="line" id="line3270"><a name="pos3270"></a>the mouths of Mrs Derby-Lewis or Walus or Mr Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line3271"><a name="pos3271"></a>Lewis? </p>
<p class="line" id="line3272"><a name="pos3272"></a>"Clive and I therefore highlighted the names of people </p>
<p class="line" id="line3273"><a name="pos3273"></a>whom we believed to be the enemies of South Africa. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3274"><a name="pos3274"></a> Certain names were added to the list I sent to Arthur </p>
<p class="line" id="line3275"><a name="pos3275"></a>such as Justice Goldstone and certain newspaper </p>
<p class="line" id="line3276"><a name="pos3276"></a>people.  Goldstone's address was needed to determine </p>
<p class="line" id="line3277"><a name="pos3277"></a>where he lived because I wanted to do an article on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3278"><a name="pos3278"></a>how he who helped to break down the Group Areas </p>
<p class="line" id="line3279"><a name="pos3279"></a>Act was now living in a white are far away from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3280"><a name="pos3280"></a>results of his 1984 Govender Judgment'.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3281"><a name="pos3281"></a>Now it also says something about Mrs Derby-Lewis Mr Chairman, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3282"><a name="pos3282"></a>not an unformed person, she knows the name of the case.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3283"><a name="pos3283"></a>	'The journalists address were requested because I wanted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3284"><a name="pos3284"></a>write about them about their attitudes towards the CP.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3285"><a name="pos3285"></a>asked Mr Pik Botha's address because there strong rumours </p>
<p class="line" id="line3286"><a name="pos3286"></a>that he owned property overseas.  This has been reported in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3287"><a name="pos3287"></a>the in the Afrikaner newspaper and perhaps the company </p>
<p class="line" id="line3288"><a name="pos3288"></a>which owned his property here, if a company owned it, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3289"><a name="pos3289"></a>would be the same company which owned the overseas </p>

<p class="line" id="line3291"><a name="pos3291"></a>supplying the addresses, I did not go into specifics.  He is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3292"><a name="pos3292"></a>politically shrewd and I believe that he felt that there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3293"><a name="pos3293"></a>no need to spell out why we needed the names.  After all we </p>
<p class="line" id="line3294"><a name="pos3294"></a>were on the phone'.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3313"><a name="pos3313"></a>Mandela Kasrils, Naidoo, Ramaphosa and Slovo.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3314"><a name="pos3314"></a>	'Clive and Kuba decided on Chris Hani to be eliminated </p>

<p class="line" id="line3317"><a name="pos3317"></a>never should have been unbanned.  Clive and Kuba wanted a </p>

<p class="line" id="line3319"><a name="pos3319"></a>was to determine what sort of security surrounded the </p>

<p class="line" id="line3321"><a name="pos3321"></a>not a logistics person, nor was I present at any discussions </p>

<p class="line" id="line3330"><a name="pos3330"></a>may I pause here.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3331"><a name="pos3331"></a>	Her previous statements make it quite clear that Hani was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3332"><a name="pos3332"></a>not alone, there was a whole list, what she says here,</p>
<p class="line" id="line3333"><a name="pos3333"></a>	'Arthur Kemp phoned me to say that he had got some of the </p>

<p class="line" id="line3339"><a name="pos3339"></a>I suppose she didn't want a description of Mr Justice Goldstones </p>
<p class="line" id="line3340"><a name="pos3340"></a>if she's telling the truth about the article and not if he was not on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3341"><a name="pos3341"></a>the hit list, it's possible. And the reporters that she wanted to - it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3342"><a name="pos3342"></a>may be that there may have been people there as a camouflage, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3343"><a name="pos3343"></a>possibly but there is no doubt about the description of the </p>

<p class="line" id="line3346"><a name="pos3346"></a>everyone was an ANC/SACP person but certainly the majority, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3347"><a name="pos3347"></a>but with these fanatics Mr Chairman, who is an ANC/SACP </p>
<p class="line" id="line3348"><a name="pos3348"></a>person isn't a matter of nice distinction as far as they are </p>
<p class="line" id="line3349"><a name="pos3349"></a>concerned on the evidence I would submit, but anyone who is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3350"><a name="pos3350"></a>fanatically preoccupied with herrenvolk ideas is a communist or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3351"><a name="pos3351"></a>an ANC person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3352"><a name="pos3352"></a>	Then on page 253 that, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3353"><a name="pos3353"></a>	'Arthur and I met at the Rotunda where Arthur gave me the </p>

<p class="line" id="line3365"><a name="pos3365"></a>stage, that where we have an improbable story told in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3366"><a name="pos3366"></a>Supreme Court where ridiculous explanations are given by the </p>

<p class="line" id="line3369"><a name="pos3369"></a>Lewis and Mr Walus had discussion on the list, that they were the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3370"><a name="pos3370"></a>ones that planned the murder, it becomes proof beyond reasonable </p>
<p class="line" id="line3371"><a name="pos3371"></a>doubt on Mrs Derby-Lewis' false evidence, coupled with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3372"><a name="pos3372"></a>statements that she made which have not been shown to have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line3373"><a name="pos3373"></a>made under any sort of pressure, not only that what the applicants </p>
<p class="line" id="line3374"><a name="pos3374"></a>have to show that her treatment was such that she was in due </p>
<p class="line" id="line3375"><a name="pos3375"></a>course to lie about herself, about Walus and about her husband, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3376"><a name="pos3376"></a>she specifically disavowed any such happening in relation to her. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3377"><a name="pos3377"></a>She was specifically asked and we will further commit it to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3378"><a name="pos3378"></a>passage by a member of the committee, and I have a graphic </p>
<p class="line" id="line3379"><a name="pos3379"></a>recollection of it, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3380"><a name="pos3380"></a>	'Despite all these things that happened to you..', </p>
<p class="line" id="line3381"><a name="pos3381"></a>if I remember correctly, it was the Chairman but I may be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3382"><a name="pos3382"></a>mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3383"><a name="pos3383"></a>	'Did you tell them anything which was untrue?'</p>
<p class="line" id="line3384"><a name="pos3384"></a>and the answer was no.  And let us remind ourselves how </p>
<p class="line" id="line3385"><a name="pos3385"></a>untruthful she was in relation to the portions that she learned </p>
<p class="line" id="line3386"><a name="pos3386"></a>were not on the video which was available.  She blue hot and cold </p>
<p class="line" id="line3387"><a name="pos3387"></a>and we refer to the cross-examination and these are the passages </p>
<p class="line" id="line3388"><a name="pos3388"></a>which are - if I could refer you to page 402 of R4, it's the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3389"><a name="pos3389"></a>continued portion, R4 continued, 402.  Well could we start with </p>
<p class="line" id="line3390"><a name="pos3390"></a>Item number 47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3391"><a name="pos3391"></a>	'On the Sunday I saw Kuba's photograph in the newspaper </p>
<p class="line" id="line3392"><a name="pos3392"></a>and recognised him at once.  I was very shocked but in my </p>
<p class="line" id="line3393"><a name="pos3393"></a>heart not at all surprised.  There had been a lot of talk </p>
<p class="line" id="line3394"><a name="pos3394"></a>between right wingers of solutions to the problems in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3395"><a name="pos3395"></a>country'.    </p>
<p class="line" id="line3396"><a name="pos3396"></a>This is the evidence her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3397"><a name="pos3397"></a>	'Clive said that he had discussed these things with Kuba'.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3398"><a name="pos3398"></a>Well that's true as a fact and of overwhelming probability that her </p>
<p class="line" id="line3399"><a name="pos3399"></a>loving husband would have told his loving wife.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3400"><a name="pos3400"></a>	'Clive was upset and I asked him what he was going to do'. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3401"><a name="pos3401"></a>A highly probable conversation after the wife party to a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3402"><a name="pos3402"></a>conspiracies was speaking to her husband after they found out </p>
<p class="line" id="line3403"><a name="pos3403"></a>that the one of the victims of their conspiracy had been murdered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3404"><a name="pos3404"></a>	'He said that during the discussions with Kuba they had </p>
<p class="line" id="line3405"><a name="pos3405"></a>mentioned such a thing like Hani's death, he said that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line3406"><a name="pos3406"></a>hadn't thought that Kuba would do such a thing at all'.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3407"><a name="pos3407"></a>Well it's partly true but certainly not the statement of a person </p>
<p class="line" id="line3408"><a name="pos3408"></a>who is being coerced to give evidence against her husband or for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3409"><a name="pos3409"></a>any other purpose.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3410"><a name="pos3410"></a>	'He did say that he couldn't understand why Kuba had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line3411"><a name="pos3411"></a>so stupid to drive around so obvious, Kuba was supposed to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3412"><a name="pos3412"></a>change the number plates.  He did admit to me however </p>
<p class="line" id="line3413"><a name="pos3413"></a>they had discussed it.  Clive did however say it looked like </p>
<p class="line" id="line3414"><a name="pos3414"></a>a set-up, seeing Kuba was caught so quickly.  We suspected </p>
<p class="line" id="line3415"><a name="pos3415"></a>APLA, we talked about Hani suddenly talking peace when </p>
<p class="line" id="line3416"><a name="pos3416"></a>he was the manifestation of the resistance.  Hani criticised </p>
<p class="line" id="line3417"><a name="pos3417"></a>the PAC in the week or two prior to the killing.  Clive </p>
<p class="line" id="line3418"><a name="pos3418"></a>thought that either APLA, the government or someone was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3419"><a name="pos3419"></a>behind it, as it didn't should like Kuba who would go into a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3420"><a name="pos3420"></a>situation head-on.  I asked Clive about the gun but he did </p>
<p class="line" id="line3421"><a name="pos3421"></a>say he couldn't tell me where he had got the gun from'.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3422"><a name="pos3422"></a>Now one does not dismiss that sort of evidence corroborative of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3423"><a name="pos3423"></a>the overwhelming probability found by Judge Eloff even without </p>
<p class="line" id="line3424"><a name="pos3424"></a>this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3425"><a name="pos3425"></a>	Then on top of page 6, during the criminal trial, Mrs Derby-</p>
<p class="line" id="line3426"><a name="pos3426"></a>Lewis had given one other reason for the list to be the purpose to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3427"><a name="pos3427"></a>write a book with Mrs Ida Parker in addition to the list being for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3428"><a name="pos3428"></a>the purposes of conducting interviews or for use by Dr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3429"><a name="pos3429"></a>Hartzenberg.  The court held that Mrs Derby-Lewis was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3430"><a name="pos3430"></a>truthful about the list and that here explanations were far fetched </p>
<p class="line" id="line3431"><a name="pos3431"></a>and that is the reference Mr Chairman to the criminal record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3432"><a name="pos3432"></a>	In her statement during detention Mrs Derby-Lewis says she </p>
<p class="line" id="line3433"><a name="pos3433"></a>did not show the list to anyone in Cape Town including Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3434"><a name="pos3434"></a>Derby-Lewis, that is in the statement and we give  you the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3435"><a name="pos3435"></a>reference, I submit that it's a correct reference, I don't want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3436"><a name="pos3436"></a>read them unless members of the Committee want me to.  Her </p>
<p class="line" id="line3437"><a name="pos3437"></a>evidence before the Committee that she placed this list on Dr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3438"><a name="pos3438"></a>Hartzenberg's table and the evidence of Dr Hartzenberg that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3439"><a name="pos3439"></a>saw documents on his table in Parliament, placed there by Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line3440"><a name="pos3440"></a>Derby-Lewis must be regarded as false.  Derby-Lewis is correct </p>
<p class="line" id="line3441"><a name="pos3441"></a>when he says that he took responsibility for compiling the list </p>
<p class="line" id="line3442"><a name="pos3442"></a>when he made his statement in detention in order to protect his </p>
<p class="line" id="line3443"><a name="pos3443"></a>wife.  His wife needed protection because the list was a hit list </p>
<p class="line" id="line3444"><a name="pos3444"></a>and he and Walus had already been arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3445"><a name="pos3445"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Can I interrupt you for a moment Mr Bizos? </p>

<p class="line" id="line3449"><a name="pos3449"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because there are a couple of blanks there </p>

<p class="line" id="line3451"><a name="pos3451"></a>MR BIZOZ:   Mr Derby-Lewis lied about Mrs Derby-Lewis' </p>
<p class="line" id="line3452"><a name="pos3452"></a>knowledge that Chris Hani was targeted for assassination.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line3453"><a name="pos3453"></a>had told her sometime in March 1993, if not earlier that he and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3454"><a name="pos3454"></a>Walus had decided upon Chris Hani as the person to be eliminated </p>
<p class="line" id="line3455"><a name="pos3455"></a>and I give the R4 reference.  Mr Derby-Lewis has lied about Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line3456"><a name="pos3456"></a>Derby-Lewis' knowledge that he had obtained the firearm for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3457"><a name="pos3457"></a>purpose of eliminating some of the people whose names appear on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3458"><a name="pos3458"></a>the list, Mrs Derby-Lewis says the following in the statement:</p>
<p class="line" id="line3459"><a name="pos3459"></a>	'It was obvious to me that Kuba had already done the deed </p>
<p class="line" id="line3460"><a name="pos3460"></a>and Clive and I later confirmed that Kuba had used the gun </p>
<p class="line" id="line3461"><a name="pos3461"></a>which Clive showed me one day in the house with a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3462"><a name="pos3462"></a>silencer'.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3463"><a name="pos3463"></a>Now Mr Derby-Lewis of course saying that he had a gun with a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3464"><a name="pos3464"></a>silencer for self protection and for practice for the neighbours not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3465"><a name="pos3465"></a>to hear, is something so far fetched which we submit will not be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3466"><a name="pos3466"></a>believed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3467"><a name="pos3467"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Perhaps this might be a convenient stage to </p>
