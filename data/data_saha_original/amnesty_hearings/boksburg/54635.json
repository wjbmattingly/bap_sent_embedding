As I was still under the doctor's care, I used to limp because I was severely injured.\n\tAt night they were chased and they passed by my house.  Just before they approached my house there was gun shot that I heard and screaming that I heard.  I got out of the house and there was also so much noise, insulting one another outside like: \"Get out those weapons\".  And when I got out of my shack I shouted: \"Comrade, comrade, what's happening\"? and one responded that: \"We've already arrested one who's sustained an injury on the neck and we are chasing this Inkatha member\" and he says his uncle who is my opposite neighbour said the uncle has concealed some weapons in his house.  \t\n\tAnd I asked as to where they found him and they answered and said they found him down the street and he was already bleeding profusely from the neck.  And I asked them: \"Now what is going to happen, why would you assault some other members right here\"?  They answered back, the said: \"You don't know anything, there are weapons concealed in this uncle's house\".  \n\tI asked him, the very person, as to where he was found by these people and he answered back and said: \"They just arrested me for no apparent reason\".  There was this one called Vips and Vips said: \"Comrade, even though you are so injured, please get inside the house and rest\".\n\tThere was another one called Maseven, he was also chased.  Shaluga was chased up to Majosi's house.  It wasn't long and I heard again a gunshot - even though I've already explained that I was still under doctor's care at the time.  And firstly when we got to this area, occupying it, each time there will be an attack we will whistle and blow some whistle and we heard the sound of a whistle.  \n\tAfter we heard that all the comrades ran and approached the scene.  I couldn't because I was limping due to the injuries that I've sustained.   When the comrades arrived it was after - they arrived, when the comrades arrived, I arrived after the incident had taken place.  The attackers were already gone and Majosi himself was already taken with Shlalugasi as well. \n\tThe next door neighbour's bakkie was taken towards, was driven towards the bridge in block A.

I was requested to leave and other people were not happy about the idea, wondering if they know what reason brought us there.  \n\tOne person whom I listened very carefully was Mr Buthelezi who said: \"People who do not stay in block F must leave and attend their own meetings in their respective blocks\".

I heard another gun fire and a whistle was blown, the very same whistle that I have already spoke about as a sign indicating an emergency.

We rushed to comrade Blanko's place.  I just want to explain something.  Blanko's real name is Malusi Jackson Kiyana.
