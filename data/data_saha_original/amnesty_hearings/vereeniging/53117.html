<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  I take it you are ready to start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, before we proceed, today being the 19th of January 1999, may I take the liberty of handing over as Evidence Leader to Mr Zuko Mapoma, who is the new Evidence Leader, I will still remain on to assist the Committee where necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Prior for your assistance, yes.  The applicants are still busy with their case.  Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, the next witness or applicant I am calling is Bhekinkosi Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom, are the applicants who were not here yesterday, here today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, the majority of the people are here today.  The two people from Kroonstad prison, are apparently on their way.  We just had a, my Attorney just phoned the prison and they said they left some time ago, so I expect them to be here any moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>	That is Timothy Stalls Mazibuko and Jack Mbele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From which prison are they, from Kroonstad?  Now what about Magubane and Mkwanazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> As far as Mkwanazi is concerned, I have absolutely nothing to say about him, he was in custody.  Apparently he was released.  There was no further contact with him since the previous hearing, and I can't state anything about his whereabouts at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Magubane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Magubane's situation is a bit difficult because I again, personally, phoned the Klerksdorp prison who said that the last time he was there, was when he was booked out to come here on the 3rd of July last year, and he was sent to the Vereeniging prison, but according to the Vereeniging prison, he is not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>	I don't know if he was released at a certain time, I cannot image so because he is not out on bail on the criminal case in the Boipatong matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Or he may simply have disappeared into the system?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It seems so, but we are following that up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about those applicants who were not here yesterday, Moses Mthembu, Sipho Buthelezi, Petrus Mdiniso, Mxoliseni Mkhize, Richard Dlamini and Paulos Mbatha, are they here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, the following people are here today:  Moses Mthembu, Petrus Mdiniso, Paulos Mbatha and Richard Dlamini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>	The people who aren't here ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mxoliseni Mkhize and Sipho Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is indeed so, and Mr Tshabangu, but he already testified.  He is also not here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he here yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No Chairperson, he wasn't here yesterday either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me get a note of that.  His name is Mlupeki Tshabangu, yes.  Shall I make a note of that?  Now, these four applicants who are here today, who were not here yesterday, what is their explanation for not being here yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> They told me that on the previous occasion, only the date was mentioned, but not the venue.  My Attorney last week made contact with Mr Tshabangu, he is the only person with a telephone, to inform the other people about the venue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>	Mr Tshabangu is not here, but the people inform me that they did not get the message that the resumed hearing will take place at the same venue, and they were uncertain as to where it was going to be and that is why they weren't here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did they know that it is here today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The people that were here yesterday, went out yesterday to notify them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What steps did they take to find out from their Attorneys where the hearing was going to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, they did not contact me or my Attorney as far as I am aware.  I can just mention that these people, they don't have telephones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  Moses Mthembu, Moses Mthembu is here?  Petrus Mdiniso, Richard Dlamini, Paulos Mbatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>	What steps did you take to ensure, to find out where the hearings were going to be held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I am Moses Mthembu, as a person who is an employee, I was expecting to be told just where the venue would be.      I did want to know, but I could not find out, and even where we stay, we do not have a telephone.  I had assumed that the lawyer, our Attorney, would actually come to us to inform us, but I was determined and I was prepared to come here.  I am very sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> I had expected that the Attorney normally tells us just where the venue would be, but this did not happen this time.  Also the reason that we do not have a telephone at home, we could not contact him, and I did not come because I did not have knowledge where the venue was.  I do beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I am Richard Dlamini, the same thing happened to me as well.  I was prepared to come, but I did not receive information about the venue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is amusing, I see you smiling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I am sorry for not showing up yesterday, I had thought that our Attorney would come to inform us about the venue, but he did not come.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I am Paulos Mbatha.  I beg your pardon, I was away at home in kwaZulu Natal and came back on Sunday and our car broke down along the way, and I arrived late in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For the record, the explanation for not being present here, given by Mthembu, Mdiniso and Dlamini is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>	You are the applicants in these matters, it is your responsibility to find out where the hearings are, not that of your Attorney.  If your Attorney doesn't contact you, you must make every effort to make sure that you find out where the venue is because otherwise this interferes with your colleagues who are in custody and in whose interest this matter was be expedited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>	It has been going on for some time.  Whilst you may not necessarily be responsible for the delay yesterday, but I think it ought to be mentioned, that in future, you've got to take every effort to ensure that you are here so that your application can be proceeded with.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>	Yes, I accept the explanation by Mbatha that the car broke down, and therefore he could not be here yesterday.  Mr Strydom, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I am calling the next applicant then, Mr Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In view of the fact that it is probably unbearably hot, please feel free to take off your coats.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>	How are we going to deal with Magubane and Mkwanazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In the light of the fact that they are legally represented, I will ask that the hearing continues in their absence, I am sure that they will be here very soon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>	I was referring actually to the people from Kroonstad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I mean the others Magubane and Mkwanazi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>	It seems to me that perhaps what we - we propose proceeding with the applications of those who are present here and if we come to the end of the hearings, and both Magubane and Mkwanazi are not here, we would propose to struck their applications off the roll at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>	What is your attitude Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I will go along with that because there may be an explanation, so I would not like that the applications be struck off now, before I get instructions and find out why they are not here.  We can only find that out in due course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I accept the position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, what is your attitude?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We are quite happy with that position Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes very well, we would proceed then.  Would you proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  I am calling Bhekinkosi Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just for the purposes of communication, channel 2 is English, channel 3 is Sotho and channel 4, is Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>	Mr Mkhize, what language are you going to speak?  Please stand up, please give us your full names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Bhekinkosi Mkhaklazeni Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">BHEKINKOSI MKHAKLAZENI MKHIZE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may sit down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry Chairperson, I noticed that in your application, there is the name Mbekiseni, is that also your name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, it is Bhekinkosi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So the name Mbekiseni, we should scrap?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is not my name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please raise your voice when you speak so that everybody at the back can hear what you are saying, and please speak slowly and take note that there are Interpreters who interpret what you are saying into English and Sotho, therefore you should also give them an opportunity to interpret what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>	If you do not understand a question, ask them to repeat it for you.  Yes Mr Strydom, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Mkhize, you applied for amnesty and you have filled in a so-called Form 1.  I want you to have a look at the document on page 61 of the index.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> There is a noise in the headphones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> There seems to be an interference in his headphones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can the Interpreter just talk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> In English or Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It doesn't matter, just so that we can see, there is obviously something wrong with that headphone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Can anybody hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> We can hear you fine, thank you.  Can you hear us now, Mr Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I was referring to the Form 1, on page 61, 62, 63 and with the annexure on page 64 and 65.  Firstly I want you to have a look at your signature on page 63, do you identify your signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is my signature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Then I want to refer you to the annexure, setting out certain of the answers in more detail.  Do you confirm the contents of this document, has it been explained to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think yes, I do, because I signed the document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, what is your standard of education?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Standard 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Certain further particulars were asked and you provided your legal advisors with answers and you stand by the answers as contained in the bundle, on page 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74?  Has it again been explained to you?  Do you confirm the correctness of your answers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Although I cannot be absolutely certain because I cannot read, but I hope that that is indeed my responses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Then I want to refer you to the affidavit you have made on page 75, 76, 77, 78 of the bundle.  Do you confirm that that is your signature on the last page thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Are you a member of the Inkatha Freedom Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> For how long have you been a member of that party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think it is about ten years now, because I joined even before I came to Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Approximately when did you come to Johannesburg, how many years ago?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I came to Johannesburg in 1975.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Where did you come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> From Mahlabatini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When you came to Johannesburg, initially where did you stay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I stayed at Sebokeng hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At a certain stage you moved over to the kwaMadala hostel, when was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was in 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In your affidavit, on page 75 you stated that you moved into the hostel in 1992.  Is that date correct or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Although I cannot be absolutely certain, I think it was in 1990.  What I know is that I moved from Sebokeng hostel into kwaMadala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why did you move to kwaMadala hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We were actually chased out of the hostel by the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know why the ANC chased you out of the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> They attacked us because we were IFP members and because we were also Zulu's and at that time Zulu's were no longer permitted to be in Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was any of your property damaged whilst you were still in Boipatong, by ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you briefly state what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> My fridge and my car were damaged, they were actually burnt, and also my clothing, bedding, household goods were also burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>	Some they confiscated and some they burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During that time, where did you work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I used to work at Metal Box.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Are you still employed by Metal Box or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why did you leave your employment there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I was being sought after, because I was alone there and I decided to flee and leave my employment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In the kwaMadala hostel, did you hold any leadership position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What was your position during 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I was the leader of AmaButho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you just briefly state what does the AmaButho entail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I was responsible for everything that went on in the AmaButho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you give me examples, what were your principal responsibilities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I was responsible for the welfare and the well being of AmaButho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What you are being asked is to tell us very briefly what you would do as Indunas?  What did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> At that time, I was the Commander of AmaButho, everything that had to do with AmaButho, was my responsibility.  Even when we went to rallies, I would lead the AmaButho in those rallies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During 1992, could people living in the kwaMadala hostel, move freely to Boipatong and other towns in the Vaal Triangle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It never used to happen.  If you went out, you would have to do so in a group of eight to ten.  You could not walk alone because if you actually went alone, you won't return, you will be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What was the hostel residents' attitude towards this situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> They were very unhappy about the situation, because they could no longer go out to the shops, there was nothing that one was free to do.  Even if you wanted to go to town, you were unable to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>	Some of us were actually taken hostage in town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In your affidavit on page 76, you make mention of a meeting that took place in the hostel approximately one week before the attack on Boipatong.  Can you give us more detail about what happened at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> At that meeting, that meeting was actually held to discuss the issue of the people who were being killed.  I was actually being asked what I was going to do about it, because people were being killed in town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>	They had actually come to complain to me, what was I going to do about the situation and they wanted me to advise on what to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know a person by the name of Damara Qunchu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I know him very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During that period, what was his position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> He was my assistant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> As a result of all the complaints and the meeting that was held approximately one week before the attack on Boipatong, what was decided to do about the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You already told the Committee that you as the leader of the AmaButho received all these complaints from the residents and they asked you what are you going to do about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>	The question is, what did you do about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Because of the pressure that I was under, I asked them to give me some time because I could see that even my life was threatened, until such time that we took the decision that we should attack, because I could see that people were being attacked and my life was even threatened by the people that I was staying with, because I was now under pressure to act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And in which manner did you act?  What did you do, what did you decide?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I told Qunchu that there is no other way except to attack, because the people are complaining and I also realised that my life was in danger, therefore we should just attack and we agreed about this with Qunchu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> We all know that the attack took place on the 17th of June 1992.  When was the, when did you have this discussion with Qunchu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Although I cannot remember correctly, but it was just a few days before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>	I cannot say precisely what the date was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say your life was in danger, and therefore you decided to tell Qunchu that you better launch an attack, your life was in danger from whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The hostel residents from kwaMadala could have attacked me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After your discussion with Qunchu, did he agree that Boipatong should be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who was responsible for planning the attack in more detail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was myself and Qunchu, but I was the one who had the responsibility of doing it and Qunchu was my assistant.  I was his Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was there any other leaders or senior people responsible for the decision, the decision now to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During the week preceding the attack, was any other leadership structures informed and notified about the decision to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want to know after your decision, your and Qunchu's decision to attack Boipatong, did you take it up with other senior people or other leaders for instance in the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  Not even one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Weapons were used during the attack on Boipatong.  Can you tell the Committee who was responsible to get the weapons and to distribute the weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I cannot say because it was dark, but I know that I had a firearm and I also know that some other people also had firearms, but I cannot tell who had what weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The question really is, before the attack, to gather weapons, who was responsible to make sure that when the attack comes, that there will be weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We already had weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> These weapons, do you have knowledge where they came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We used to actually collect money and buy these weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>	The person who was responsible for actually buying these weapons, was Mr Qunchu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And these weapons, did they include AK47 rifles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On the 17th of June, the attack took place.  What I want to know now, what happened just before the attack, what happened in the hostel?  How did it come that everybody left the hostel and moved towards Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We rang an alarm to call everybody to gather at one venue, from where we moved on to launch the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who rang the alarm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Even though I would not be in a position to know, it was at night, but I had already instructed that we should go out and launch the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was having this alarm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is exactly what I am saying, it was at night, and therefore I am not in the position to say exactly who was ringing the alarm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there anyone in the hostel perhaps who was charged with blowing this trumpet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I moved from one hostel apartment to the next, informing people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there any particular person who used to go around using this trumpet or alarm to ring it so as to inform people to come together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, there was one person responsible for that duty, but he was not available that day if I still remember very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just, if you will allow me Mr Strydom, sorry, everyone talks about this alarm.  What exactly was it?  Some people talk figuratively about a trumpet.  Just explain to us what kind of alarm was it, how did it work?  Was it electronic, was it a siren?  What was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We have a trumpet and we also had something that looked like a speaker.  Those are the things that we used.  The speaker would sound like an alarm and this would inform people about a gathering.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So it was like a loudhailer from the way you are demonstrating with your hands, that had an alarm sound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And then in addition to that, there was a trumpet, an actual trumpet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, we also had a trumpet, but on that day, I cannot be certain as to whether we used the trumpet or not, or whether we used the other system.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, you didn't give someone a specific instruction to go and sound the alarm, or did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Who made the decision that the people should be called at a certain time and that the alarm should be sounded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So then you did give someone an instruction to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> This alarm, is it called a Megaphone with an alarm at the back of the Megaphone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.  Even though I would not know exactly, but it is an alarm system, you can carry it around and speak through it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It is one of those instruments where you can speak into it and you press the button and you speak into it, and it enhances the sound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At the back of this instrument, there is an alarm.  You put that alarm on, the alarm will sound through this microphone or the speaker actually, through the speaker?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When this alarm went off, let me ask you this way, normally when the alarm goes off, what will the residents of the hostel do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We used to use it when we were going to rallies or attending urgent meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Will the people gather when they hear the sound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Where will they gather?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> There is a stadium inside the hostel, at the kwaMadala hostel, that is where we used to gather for meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On this particular night, did the people come to the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were you at the stadium when the people arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you address the people as they were coming in the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What did you tell them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I told them there was nothing else to do, except for attacking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Attacking which place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did the people initially arrive with weapons at the stadium, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Some of them were not armed, some were armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>	Some suggested that we wait for them, because they were still going to fetch their arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And the women and children, what happened to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We told them to go back to their houses, because it was not necessary for them to be there, we only wanted males.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Apart from the arms, did the people wear any identifying marks or things like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.  We used to use head bands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What was the purpose of the head bands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The purpose was for us to be able to identify one another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Still there at the stadium, when you said that Boipatong should be attacked, did you give any detail as to exactly how Boipatong should be attacked, or will be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  I cannot remember very well, but yes, I remember that I indicated that we are going to enter Boipatong.  Nothing else was going to be done, except to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>	We were aware of the existence of the Defence Unit members at Boipatong, and these are the people who were responsible for burning people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who led the people out of the hostel en route to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What kind of arm did you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I had an AK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now, I want you to tell now in your own words what happened just prior entering Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> When we arrived, we waited for others to arrive and thereafter we entered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>	There were many of us and some of us had been left behind, but we waited for them and when they arrived, we then got entry into Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you give any further instructions at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I cannot remember very well, but the only instruction was that we should now enter, because we were going to fight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>	We were tired of these people, we were dying every day, we were being killed, and we had to go and attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In your own mind, you say that you wanted to attack and the people wanted to attack Boipatong, can you describe what you thought, what kind of attack would take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Would you please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You testified that you were going to attack Boipatong.  In your own mind, what was your decision, in which manner were you going to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We were going to avenge the death of many of our people, and we too, had to do the same attack and kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>	We just went there to avenge the death of our fellow members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In your own mind, who would be the victims of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> What I had in my mind, was that people who were attacking us, were the Self Defence Units.  We had already heard that they were patrolling the streets at night, and these are the people that we wanted to attack and kill, because they were the ones who were burning people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> These Self Defence Units, do you know at that stage, who was actually supporting them or responsible for them to be established?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am not in the position to say, I don't want to tell a lie.  I have no idea, but yes, we know that the people who were in charge of the township, were the Self Defence Units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> How well, at that time, did you know Boipatong, the township itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I knew Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you know the name of the streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not know the names very well.  The one street that I knew, was only one Mzimvubu and Majola I think.  That was the street that I knew very well, not the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>	It was a township where I used to catch a bus, the form of transport to work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want you to explain how Boipatong was entered on that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> As I have already explained, we just gained entry into the township, but I cannot remember what street we used to gain entry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>	I did explain that I do not know the streets quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can I ask you this way, did you enter from Vanderbijl Park's side or the factory side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> From the main road from Vanderbijl Park, that is the direction that we took, and we proceeded towards the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That main road, is that called Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think so.  Even though I do not know the name quite well, but I am referring to the big road with the traffic lights.  The one that is going to Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Tell me, would you be in a position to explain to the Committee you have followed in Boipatong itself, after you entered Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.  I know the route that we took.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Would you be able to explain the route if you looked at a map?  Would you be able, if you look at a map, to explain the route, or won't you be able to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't know, maybe I will be able to identify the route.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I think the Exhibit number is J, I just want to make sure, I just want to get my Exhibits at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>	I am going to show you a map of the Boipatong, if you just want to orientate yourself, and look at the map.  Do you understand the map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Just to make sure that you understand the map, Frikkie Meyer Boulevard is to the left of this map, to the side, and the hostel is further to the left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>	Do you follow that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I do follow that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know the portion of the township called Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you see Slovo Park on the right hand side of this map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, now I think I see where it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During the course of the attack, did you go into Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> We have already heard evidence of two groups, is that indeed so that there was a split up at a certain stage and two groups were formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were you leading one of the groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who led the other group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think it was  Qunchu because I never got to see him again.  He was not in my group certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.  With reference to Exhibit J, can you state the approximate route that was followed by your group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think we were further down and the other group was further up.  We took the downward direction and there were no other people further down, except for ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did your group follow a route towards Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Shortly after the two groups entered Boipatong, what happened if anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I cannot remember quite well, but when we arrived near the shops, we came across the Self Defence Unit members from whence we started exchanging gunfire and they ended up fleeing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you use your AK47 to shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Which direction did you shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I shot towards the Self Defence Unit members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know if you hit anybody by shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not have information to that effect, but I can assume that people must have been shot because it was at night.  Yes, we did see some shadows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After that first shooting incident, what happened?  What did you do with your group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We proceeded on towards the downward direction, running after them, and they fled towards Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you go into any houses at any stage whilst you were at Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, some people got into houses, but I did not because we were making sure that some of our own, are not attacked from behind, so we had to remain behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you personally see anybody who was attacked and killed or injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  No.  I only discovered the following morning, that there were many people who were really injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who was responsible for breaking all those windows in the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would say some of the people in our group, did that.  It was damaging and damaging all the way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see any person or anyone of the attackers, in possession of any goods, stolen goods or things like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I only - well, I can say I did not see them quite well, but I only learnt the following day because when we got into people's apartments the following day at the hostel,  we learnt that some people brought home stolen property, but they had hidden some of these.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>	That was not our instruction and that was not my instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You refer now to instruction, can you just tell us more about the instruction you gave during the course of that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The instruction was that we should go and attack and kill and that is all.   We were meant to kill the people who were killing us all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When was this instruction given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The instruction came out when we left the hostel for Boipatong.  I indicated that we had no alternative.  We had to avenge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Approximately how long did this attack take place, before your group left the township again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would not be certain, but I think it could have been one and a half hours to two hours, but it was not a very long time.  That is just but an estimation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During this period that the attack took place, did you see any military or police vehicles in the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not see any police or military vehicle, except for the one vehicle that we saw on our way out from the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>	This vehicle was coming from the Vanderbijl direction.  That is the only vehicle that I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Would that include Slovo Park, did you see any vehicles in Slovo Park, military or police vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Before the attack was there any discussions with any police or military people, to assist you and the other attackers during the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> How could we have invited the police whilst we were on our way to attack and kill people?  The police were obviously against that and therefore we could not have invited them to be part of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After the attack, did you re-enter the hostel at the main gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You made reference to certain goods that were found in the hostel afterwards.  What happened to those goods, stolen goods?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did indicate that I only heard that there are some stolen goods, but I was not able to point them out.  We only heard about this, and we moved around, looking for these stolen goods, but we were not able to find any.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>	Some of the people had burnt some of these stolen goods.  I am not in the position to say, therefore, that I found a particular item in a particular house or apartment.  It was at night, and there were so many people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know who gave the instruction that stolen goods should be burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I know not of anyone.  I don't think it could have been anyone, except that they on their own, may have decided that if I happen to see this, I will not be in agreement with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Themba Khoza, as far as you know, was he aware of the attack prior to the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, he knew nothing.  Khoza does not reside here, he would only come once to deliver a message or informing us about a meeting, but he does not reside here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>	In some instances, we would go and report to him what was developing, but he knew nothing and he could not have condoned this attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Afterwards, during any meeting that could have taken place, did Mr Themba Khoza in your presence, tell the residents to burn the looted or the stolen goods?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  He did not instruct anyone to that effect, except that maybe he might have told them in my absence, but I do not recall at any instance, him informing the residents to burn all the stolen property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>	The one thing that I remember him saying was that the police are present and we should cooperate with them, we should not fight them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After - let me ask you in this way  - you testified that you heard later on that a certain amount of people were killed in the township, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you expect that any amount of people could be killed on that particular night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In retrospect, thinking back now, how do you feel about the whole situation that so many innocent people got killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I felt very bad after the incident, because I discovered later that some of the people who died, were not necessarily the people who were attacking us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>	Some of the people who were really attacking us, escaped unscathed.  People who were really involved or responsible, fled and that made me feel bad.  That is why I am before this Committee today, to seek amnesty.  I feel very sorry because we did not manage to get all the people who were responsible for us being attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On the night of the attack, was Mr Vanana Zulu, Prince Vanana Zulu, was he present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  If I am not mistaken, he had gone home.  I am not sure whether that was the first or the second week that he was absent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>	What actually led to us to launching the attack, was because he was against us launching that attack and he wanted to actually discuss the matter with the township residents, and that is why we decided to launch the attack in his absence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>	That is when we actually got the opportunity to be able to launch that attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> A person by the name of Victor Keswa, I think his nickname is Katisi, was he there that night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, he was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, that last answer was not translated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> I apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Repeat the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I said Mr Keswa was absent.  I cannot recall whether he was in hospital or in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You gave evidence in your defence during a criminal trial, and you denied that you know anything about the attack.  Why did you do that during the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At the criminal trial, you denied that you have any knowledge whatsoever about the attack.  Why did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think that was because of the situation at the trial, I did not want to be convicted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STRYDOM</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.   Are there any questions from the (indistinct) side, Ms Pretorius?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PRETORIUS:</span> As the Chair pleases.  I would just like to know Mr Mkhize, you say you left your job because you were all alone, what did you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> There was no other Zulu person there, or anybody else who belonged to the IFP.  I was just the only one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>	There was no other IFP member or anybody who also came from kwaZulu Natal.  Therefore there was no one to protect me.   The only thing I could do, was to flee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> What were you scared of at the time, at your employment, who were the people you were working with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> All the employees at Metal Box, were ANC members.  I was the only Inkatha member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> You would not move freely in the Vaal Triangle, you had to be a group of eight or ten when you went out.  If you were alone, you would be killed.  Who would kill you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was the ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> In Boipatong, you say that you do not know who was in charge of the SDU's.  I think the question is not the person, but who was the organisation who was in charge of the SDU's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not have knowledge, but what I know is that the SDU's were ANC people.  That is what I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> When Katisi or Victor Keswa was in hospital, was he also in custody at the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is the period I was referring to, that I am not certain whether he was in hospital or in prison.  I am not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> No, the question is, even when he was in hospital, was he in custody at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I have no further question, thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PRETORIUS</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Da Silva?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DA SILVA:</span> May it please you Mr Chairman.  Do you know a gentleman called Daniel Mabote, or Themba Mabote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Did he participate in this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I understand from the evidence of the other applicants that after the attack, directly after the attack, a group of people gathered in a veld west of Boipatong, between Boipatong and Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, is that correct?  That was immediately before the group crossed over Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think there was a group that did meet there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Do you remember if Mr Themba Mabote was armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, he was armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Do you recall what type of weapon he had with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> At the criminal trial, Mr Holi Bajozi testified that Themba Mabote fired in the direction of a military vehicle.  Did you see that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I do not have any further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DA SILVA</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Ma'am?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS TANZER:</span> Are you aware of a resident in the hostel by the name of Andries Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Excuse me Ma'am, maybe if you can place yourself on record.  If you may place yourself on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I do apologise.  My name of Goldie Tanzer.  I am an Attorney at law and I am representing I think the 17th applicant in this matter, Andries Matanzima Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>	Should I repeat the question?  Are you aware or did you know a resident at the kwaMadala hostel by the name of Andries Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So then you wouldn't know whether he took part in this Boipatong attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not know because I don't even know him, so I won't know even if he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> You said that you felt that your life was threatened.  In what way was your life threatened in the hostel, prior to the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did explain that the residents could have attacked me.  The people I lived with at the hostel, nobody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Were you receiving personal threats of any kind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> By how many residents, by everybody, by one, by two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was the residents.  I cannot point out specific individuals, but it was the residents who were complaining about the attacks that were carried out on them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> In what way were they threatening your life?  You said that they were threatening your life.  What did they intend to do to you, what did they say they were going to do to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> What I was explaining was that I felt that my life was in danger, I could have been killed at any time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Where did you get the weapons from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did explain that the person who was responsible for it, was Mr Qunchu.  He had knowledge of where the weapons came from, but we actually collected money to buy those weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> From who was the money collected to buy the weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We, the residents of kwaMadala hostel, used to pay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So you obviously weren't aware from where the weapons were bought, who they were bought from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not have knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Is it not correct that two meetings actually took place prior to the attack?  In fact one meeting took place about two weeks before the attack in which the anger was expressed and then a meeting took place about two or three days before the attack, in which the attack was planned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would not dispute that, because there were many meetings that were held, where people were complaining.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>	A number of meetings were called, because of the situation.  Whether there were two or three or even more than that, I cannot recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> At any of these meetings, were any policemen present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> At any of these meetings, were any police or military present, at these meetings that were held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The police would not attend those meetings.  We would not invite the police when we were actually planning to launch an attack on people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> When the siren rang, did the people all come, the residents come wearing their head bands, or did they put them on at the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I told them that they should go and fetch their head bands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> And when you made your way to Boipatong, did you go by foot or was there any kind of vehicle in which you - accompanied you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We walked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> And on your way, you met no policemen whatsoever, or any military?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  I did mention that we did not meet any policemen.  We saw the police when we were actually leaving the area.  I cannot say whether they were police or military personnel, but the only people we saw, we actually saw them when we were returning from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> At the meeting prior to the attack, did you drink any kind of muti and incite the residents to go and kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, we normally used muti.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> At this meeting, did you tell the residents only to tell the members of the Self Defence Unit or to kill anybody they saw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We told them to kill only the SDU members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> How many residents did you need to kill the SDU members?  How many members actually attended this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> The question is how many residents of the hostel were sent to kill the members of this SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> All the men who were present at the hostel.   I am not sure of the number of the people who were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Approximately how many residents did go to Boipatong with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not want to tell lies, but we were many.  I cannot specify the number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> As you entered Boipatong, did you all go together or did you split up in different streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We split up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Was each group that was split up, were they led, was there a leader allocated to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> There were only two groups.  I think the other one was led by Damara and the other one was led by myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> If there were only two groups, there must have been what, something like 40, 50 members in each group?  There must have been a group of about 50 people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where do you base that?  Where do you base that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the basis of those figures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> The basis is, if he says many residents from the hostel went to Boipatong, and they split into two groups, then each group has to have amounted to quite, several amount of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where do you get the figures 40 to 50?  As I understand his evidence, it is that every member, resident of the hostel, went out.  He doesn't know how many were there, he is not in a position to estimate, but there were many of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>	On what basis do you say that there were 40 to 50 in each group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> As the Chairman pleases, I am just surmises 40 to 50, there could have been much more than that.  That was just a guess.  I withdraw that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't have to withdraw the question, unless you have proper basis for suggesting those figures.  It may well be that those are your instructions.  I assume, are those your instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> My instructions are that in fact they split up into many groups, each group taking different streets in fact, and not, there was no mention of two groups.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>	My question really is if they were split in two groups, that would have to be a huge amount of people in each group, which almost would be uncontrollable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but I think perhaps what you should do is where your instructions differ from his evidence, perhaps you should put that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> As the Chairman pleases.  I put it to you according to the 18th applicant's version, Andries Nosenga, that in fact you were split up into little groups, smaller groups and each were attacking different streets, different houses in different streets and that there were about six, seven members in each group and it wasn't two separate groups completely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> What I can say is that that person doesn't know what he is talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>	There were only two groups.  I do not even know who that person is.  What he is telling you, maybe is what he has just surmised, but it is not a fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are your instructions that there were approximately many groups, is it into many groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that in each group there were approximately six or seven people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that those groups went out, entering various houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.  At what stage were those, did the group split into those different groups, right from the beginning or perhaps the moment when they entered the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well, according to Mr Nosenga's version, it is from the beginning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>	I in fact put it to you that as you left the hostel, you were met by policemen in three or four caspirs, that actually accompanied you to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Is that what Mr Nosenga is saying?  That is not true.  Maybe he alone was with the police, but we did not have policemen at our company.  He doesn't know what he is talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>	The police were never present when we went there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many caspirs were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many caspirs were there according to Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> According to Mr Nosenga, there were about three to four caspirs, accompanying the members.  He is not exactly sure, but he is definitely sure of the caspirs being present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>	I further put it to you that at the meetings prior to the attack, that in fact according to Mr Nosenga, a policeman named Peens, came to the meeting and basically encouraged this attack and advised that there would be assistance from the police in the carrying out of the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think that Nosenga is trying to confuse you.  That is all lies.  There was never a white person, nor a policeman, when we went to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The meeting that Mr Nosenga is referring to, is that the meeting, the very last meeting from which they just went on a rampage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> No, in fact the meeting that he referred to was the meeting before the last meeting in which the rampage was discussed, the attack was actually discussed in detail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>	According to Mr Nosenga, in fact your versions are very similar, except for the fact that he submits that policemen did accompany you to the Boipatong and in fact took part in the attack at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think he just hates the police.  That is all lies, he is just trying to implicate the police.  They were never involved in the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you putting it to this witness that Nosenga says his version, and that of the witness, are the same excepting for the presence of the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman, they were primarily the same.  They might differ in very insignificant ways, but generally the story is the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From what you have just put to the witness, it seems to me that they differ.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Mr Chairman, Mr Nosenga states basically the way the attack took place, the calling to the stadium, the meetings, the proceeding to Boipatong itself, was generally the same until they reached the street, then they were accompanied by caspirs.  Some of the residents in fact, got on the caspirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>	He in fact, got into one of the caspirs himself.  He can identify the other people plus policemen that were with him in the caspir and basically as they arrived in Boipatong, how they were off-loaded at the street and they went into the houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Those two versions can't be the same then.  They differ fundamentally?  Anyway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> As the Chairman pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Put this to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I put it to you that according to Mr Nosenga, that you were accompanied by policemen, headed by one Mr Peens to Boipatong, that you were accompanied with caspirs and that in fact some of the residents ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ma'am, would you please bear in mind that we have the Interpreters who still have to interpret?  Just put it bit by bit if you don't mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I put it to you that you were accompanied by caspirs, driven by policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> What Nosenga is saying, is all lies.  He is going to be arrested and convicted, because he is lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Mr Nosenga further says that he entered a caspir, driven by - well, he entered a caspir in which Mr Peens and some other policemen were also in that caspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Are you referring to Mr Nosenga?  Is he the one who got into the caspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> That is correct, amongst others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I will not dispute if he says he went into a caspir, but with regards to other people who were present when the attack was launched, no one went into a caspir, there was no policemen, there was no caspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> According to Mr Nosenga, in fact, he can remember the following people in the caspir, one Katheni, Rubin, Themba Kubeka, one person known as Lucky, Sipho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Microphone not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Katheni, according to Mr Nosenga it is Katheni.  Katheni, and I said Ruben.  These are people known to him as Ruben, Themba Kubeka, a person named Lucky,  a person named Sipho, a person named Makuka who he said was later killed in the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you spell that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Makuka.  A person named Tsamo, a person named Dondo who he said was leading his group and somebody named Makeze.  The spelling might not be correct Mr Chairman, but that is what I was able to obtain from Mr Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>	In fact, according to Mr Nosenga, as they entered the caspir, the caspir was - the policemen there were in civilian clothes and they included a Mr Peens, that he had recognised from the meetings, a person named Shaka.  Shaka he had known because he had recognised him who had arrested him in the past, and a policemen known as Rooikop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is all lies.  I am not even going to comment on it, because it is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> According to Mr Nosenga, when the looting took place from the houses, televisions, videos and other such items were taken and in fact, they were put into the caspirs and they were not carried back to the hostel, but they were actually put into the caspirs, which were taken to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I have no knowledge thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Is it correct that after the attack, Mr Themba Khoza praised the residents of the hostel for the attack and the success of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, that is not true.  Mr Khoza has never referred to this incident and he did not know what was going on.  What he said was that he would like us to cooperate with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>	He actually left that message that we should cooperate with the police.  He actually called us directly and gave us that message.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>	With regards to him praising us, I have no knowledge thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Is it not correct that several weeks after the attack, you in fact went to Ulundi to celebrate the success of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> After the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We were actually arrested after the attack.  We were arrested about three days thereafter, or maybe about a week thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>	When would we have gone to Ulundi then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> How many people were arrested at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> About 80 people.  Although I cannot specify the correct number, but we were about 80.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I put it to you on Mr Nosenga's version that a few weeks after the attack, he accompanied many others to Ulundi, where in fact he was praised at the rally for the attack and for the success of the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> He must have gone there alone to receive those praises.  We were already in prison by that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> My final question is, the Boipatong attack, do you think that was a random attack or was that planned?  Was that a random action or was it a planned action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was both planned and random because people had been complaining for quite some time that they are being attacked and killed and were actually confronting me on what to do, because they were no longer free to move around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a>	That is where the planning was involved.  That is, we planned to attack Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Do you take personal responsibility for the innocent lives that were lost as a result of this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> No further questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS TANZER</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson, I have no question at this stage.  Perhaps I may have a question after cross-examination by the victims' legal representation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, we intend taking a tea adjournment at this stage, and coming back at eleven o'clock.  Will that be in order for you?</p>

It is unbearably hot here, and these lights are just making the situation worse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I am not sure Chairperson, it all depends to the TV personnel.  I think it depends on the TV personnel, I do not know how much light they need, perhaps I might find out from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think we should, if we just have the minimum light that is necessary for them to carry on with their business, without interfering with ours.</p>

<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson, I have literally just been handed a statement, I believe that you have also just been handed a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which statement is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It is a sworn statement, I guess it is an affidavit by Mr Andries Matanzima Nosenga.  I believe my learned friends have all been handed copies as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... that is contained in this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Sorry Chairperson, we have not yet handed the statement in, we have just received it when the Committee was just coming.  I've got the statement, the copies with me now, I can hand them in to the Committee.  It is an addition to the bundle of documents that are here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The affidavit that is contained here, is not signed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I am loathe to do this, but from a brief reading of the statement, I have read a couple of paragraphs, it would appear that there is a lot in the statement that I will need to put in cross-examination of the witness.</p>

<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please get on, and if it is necessary, we will give you the opportunity to go through the statement and your colleagues who are with you in this matter, can read the statement in the meantime and then take over the cross-examination at some point.</p>

<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you commence, shall we - what was the last Exhibit number?  I take it that this statement is being handed in as part of the application of Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> It is Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Add it to the addendum to the Boipatong index, which is the last bundle of documents, and according to my numbering, this document goes up to page 17.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>	Shall we then mark this one - does it go up to 23, right?  Is it necessary to give the addendum a separate Exhibit number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I suggest it would be  Chairperson.  We handed in our memorandum, that was O, I don't know if there were any Exhibits after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it would be P.  The reply would then we Exhibit P.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, there were two replies, so might I suggest that the reply by the applicants be Exhibit P, that the reply by the SANDF be Exhibit Q and then the addendum will be Exhibit R.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The SANDF reply would then be Q, right?  The addendum to Boipatong index,  which consist of the application by Nosenga and the accompanying documents, shall be marked</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">Exhibit R:</span> .   Yes, very well.  Yes, Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Mkhize, you have told the Committee that you were the leader of the AmaButho.  How did that fit in to the other structures at kwaMadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Which structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were there any other structures besides the AmaButho in kwaMadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, there was a youth leadership and the middle leadership and that later on, that of AmaButho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who was in charge of, who was the leader of the youth leadership?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I wouldn't know exactly, but the one that I still remember is Mr Buthelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Which Buthelezi is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> There he is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You are pointing to somebody in the audience.  Is it one of the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where is he, in which row?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> There he is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you his first name, do you know his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> He is Mqambileni Buthelezi.  Nicholas is his other name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he was the leader of the youth in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that was an IFP structure, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you said there was a middle committee.  Who was the leader of the middle committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was Prince and ourselves.  We were part of that leadership.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That is Prince Vanana Zulu that you are talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say it was he, yourself and anyone else in the leadership?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, there were several others, but the one who was above us all was the Prince himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Can you give the names of the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is not easy, I have forgotten them, it has been a long time now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Surely you can remember the other people who served with you on this committee, being the leaders of the IFP in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, but then we did not know one another quite well.  I am from Mahlabatini and often times, they used to refer to me as Mkhize, they don't know my name, and I know them as Zulu, Shohesa, Mtjale, etc, and therefore it is not easy for me to know their actual name, apart from the surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a>	They too, like Prince Zulu for example,  he is the one who knows what my name is and my surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All that you are being asked is to give us the names of the other committee members, whether you knew them by surname or by first name, it doesn't matter.  All that Counsel requires is for you to tell us who else was a member of that committee, do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.  It was the Prince himself and Shohesa.  I am very sorry, I cannot remember the others, it has been a long time since.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have said Zulu Shohesa, is there any other person that you can still recall who was a member of this committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, there are others that I can remember, but the problem is that I cannot recall them now, but when I see them, I can recall that they were part of the committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>	We have gone our separate ways.  We left and I went to stay at a different place.  We are no longer together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mkhize, you served on this committee from 1990, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, if I am not mistaken, that is correct.  I think it was round about October.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You served on the committee for almost two years before the massacre, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the only people whose names you can now recall as being co-members with you on the committee is Prince Vanana Zulu and a man by the name of Shohesa.  That is all you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, these are the names that I can still recall.  The reason being that it has been a long time, and also the fact that we no longer reside in the same hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>	We are now around Sebokeng and some of them have remained behind at kwaMadala hostel, that is why I have lost their names.  I can only remember when I go back to the hostel, see them and I can recall that they were part of the committee.  Some came from Nongoma and I come from Mahlabatini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is Shohesa amongst the applicants, is he present in the hall today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You mentioned Zondo and Mtjale, were they also on the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I was just giving an example to the fact that we used to use our surnames to refer to one another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was this committee also known as the Steering Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not get it quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know about the Steering Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was a committee that was responsible for the residents of the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you also on that committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who else was on that committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I have said earlier on that the Prince, as well as Shohesa.  I cannot recall the others, I cannot recall their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If I am correct, when you refer to the Steering Committee and the middle committee, you are referring to one and the same committee, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, you were asked that question on page 66, paragraph 5, please identify those persons who were members of the Steering Committee of kwaMadala during 17 June 1992 and your answer, page 70, paragraph 5, Moses Mthembu, Vanana Zulu and myself, although I played just a minor role on this committee.  Is that answer correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you forget about Moses Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.  I did point out that it has been a long time since this happened.  We then parted ways and it has been a long time since we parted ways.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>	Not that I am trying to hide something.  Moses Mthembu was actually more on the side of the firm than us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mqambileni Buthelezi was asked the same question at page 50, question 3.  He was asked please identify those persons who were members of the Steering Committee of kwaMadala during 17 June 1992 and his answer which is at page 53, paragraph 3, is that the members were Moses Mthembu, Ntuli, Mkwanazi and Shohesa.  You can see some of the names are the same as you have given, some are different, but he leaves you off this committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>	My question to you is who really was serving on this Steering Committee or middle committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> You have already referred to Mkwanazi, yes, now I can remember that Mkwanazi and Ntuli were part of this committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where is Ntuli now?  Ntuli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think he is on retirement or pension, but I am not quite sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Mkwanazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, he is still around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that Sonny Michael Mkwanazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  No, I do not know his name quite well, I just know he is Mkwanazi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Apparently there was also a senior committee in the hostel, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who served on the senior committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> This is the very same committee that I am talking about, there was no other committee above it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So the committee that we refer to as the Steering Committee or the middle committee, was also known as the senior committee, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Have a look please at page 70 of the bundle of documents.   You were asked in question 4 on page 66, to supply details about the structures of the various committees at kwaMadala.  These questions were discussed with you by your legal representatives, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you then gave answers through an Interpreter which were then recorded from page 69 onwards, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You said there at page 69, paragraph 4.1 that there was a Steering Committee which was in control of the hostel.  That is the committee that you have told us about where you were on, Vanana Zulu, Moses Mthembu and the others.  You were all in control of the hostel, would that be right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you say in paragraph 4.2, the political structures were the senior men and the youth.  The political structures had nothing to do with the management structure in the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>	Are you saying that there were ISCOR structures, the committee that we have just referred to and political structures which were separate from those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say in paragraph 4.3 that the youth was responsible for the organisation of rallies, whilst the senior structure was responsible for discipline within the IFP party as well as decision making that relates to the IFP within the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a>	If I were to ask you who were the IFP leaders in the hostel, who would you say they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I was one of the leaders of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> People such as Mkwanazi and Shohesa and the Prince himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Moses Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, and Moses Mthembu.  But then I don't want to include him that much because he was working for the firm, he was working under the directorship of the firm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you say in paragraph 4.4 the Steering Committee was ultimately responsible to ISCOR, the structure I was the leader of, was called AmaButho and in that capacity, I was the leader of the IFP in the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>	As I understand your evidence now, you are not saying that you were the most senior leader of the IFP in the hostel, you are saying, and if I am wrong, correct me, you are saying you were one of the leaders of the IFP in the hostel but there were others, such as Mkwanazi, Shohesa, Ntuli, Prince Vanana Zulu, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And who would be the overall leader of the IFP in the hostel, who would be the most senior leader of the IFP in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was Prince Vanana Zulu and Mthembu.  Mthembu was in that senior position in so far as his job is concerned, being an employee of ISCOR.  That is at least the knowledge that I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And underneath Vanana Zulu and Moses Mthembu, who was next in line?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was Ntuli, Mkwanazi as well as Shohesa and then we would be just part of that list, at the bottom of those names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you say we, you are referring to yourself?  You would be at the bottom of that list of names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Damara Qunchu, he was not on that committee, he was your assistant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, he was not part of this committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would it be correct to say that Damara Qunchu was the leader of the group of men that came from Umsinga to the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I want to read to you what Victor Mthembu says at page 5, paragraph 5.  Let me start with paragraph 4, he says the Indunas of the IFP at the hostel at the time, were Prince Vanana Zulu and a certain Mkhize who came from Umsinga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>	They were the Indunas of the kwaMadala hostel during 1990 and up to 1993.  Do you have any comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, Qunchu did not hold any position at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, no, you are not listening to what I am reading.  I didn't read anything about Qunchu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Okay, I will read slowly.  Mr Victor Mthembu says the following, he says that the Indunas of the IFP at the hostel at the time, were Prince Vanana Zulu, that is Mtwana and a certain Mkhize, who came from Umsinga.  They were the Indunas of the kwaMadala hostel during 1990 and up to 1993.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am aware that the Prince was the person responsible for the entire hostel.  I am not aware of that Mkhize from Umsinga, because I am from Mahlabatini, not Umsinga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>	I know that I was an Induna at the hostel, but I do not come from Umsinga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well the Mkhize that Mr Victor Mthembu is referring to, is you.  You are the Mkhize he refers to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not dispute that, but I dispute the fact that that Mkhize came from Umsinga, I do not come from that place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He goes on in paragraph 5 and he says during 1990 Mkhize and Damara Qunchu came from Umsinga, kwaZulu-Natal to come and help us against the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a>	It is correct that you came to the hostel in 1990, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it also correct that Damara Qunchu came from Umsinga in 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is not correct.  Qunchu used to work at Cape Gate, he had been working there for a very long time.  When the conflict started, he had already been there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He goes on to say that they came at the beginning of the violence in Sebokeng in 1990, after the ANC had started burning the houses of the Zulu's and members of the IFP in Sebokeng, which resulted in all the Zulu's and IFP members gathering at the kwaMadala hostel.  Would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, this did happen.  We did meet and decide to stay in the hostel, because of the attacks that we were experiencing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>	Because of those attacks, we decided to come together and stay in the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He says they were there from 1990 until 1993 when I was arrested, that was the last time I saw them there.  I do not know who gave orders to Qunchu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>	Was it a secret that Damara Qunchu was your assistant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was not a secret.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then in paragraph 6, Mr Mthembu says Damara Qunchu was the leader of the hit squads from Umsinga.  He was the leader of the hit squad in the kwaMadala hostel as well.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am not aware of those hit squads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was there a group of men, 40 to 50 men, who came from Umsinga to stay at kwaMadala hostel who were not working at ISCOR and who lived in the hostel and who were supported by the other residents in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is not correct.  There were people from Umsinga, but they were not more than ten.  They could have been eleven at the most and I knew them.  We are still staying with these people.  They were not 40.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>	No, some of them used to work in the taxi business, just like Mr Qunchu, he owned taxi's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, because Mr Victor Mthembu talks in great detail in his affidavit about this Umsinga contingent, and his version coincides with your version about paying money, or money being collected from the residents for the purchase of guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>	He talks about it in paragraph 8 on page 6, he says that after the police had raided the hostel, no weapons were left and then this resulted in Vanana Zulu telling us that everybody had to contribute so that more weapons could be bought.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't remember it clearly.  What I do remember is that I was one of the people who used to call meetings where we would discuss how much was required to buy those weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there an incident when the police came to the hostel and confiscated firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The police normally came to the hostel and they would confiscate firearms.  It used to happen quite frequently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After they had been confiscated, would the residents of the hostel then collect money to buy further arms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Vanana Zulu would attend these meetings, call upon the residents to contribute money so that weapons could be bought, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't remember it that way.  What I remember is that I was the person responsible for collecting or asking people to collect that money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu says that the reason that he gave money and he talks about others also giving for the same reason, was that they were afraid that if they didn't give money for these weapons, that they would be killed by members of the Umsinga contingent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It could be, I cannot dispute what he is saying because as I also mentioned, I realised that my life was in danger.  He could have realised the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, that is exactly where I was coming to Mr Mkhize.  You say that you launched the attack on Boipatong because you felt that if you didn't do that at that stage, you yourself could be killed by some of the hostel residents, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And was it not this Umsinga contingent that you feared would kill you, if the attack was not launched?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I said it was the residents of kwaMadala.  I did not refer to specific individuals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a>	I just said it was the residents of the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, which residents in particular did you fear might go so far as to kill you if an attack was not launched?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was the residents of kwaMadala hostel who were complaining of being attacked and killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In the attack on the 17th of June 1992, did you feel that there was a group of residents in the hostel who were intent on killing you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you feel that if you had not launched the attack on the 17th of June 1992, that there was a group of residents whom you didn't know by name, who were intent on killing you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You made a confession or let me move away from a loaded word like that, let me say that you made a statement after your arrest to a Captain Radley, do you remember that, that was on the 11th of July 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you not remember making any statement to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember because we were assaulted by the police, because we were assaulted and we made several statements at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am referring to Exhibit E which is currently before the Committee, perhaps if my learned friend, Mr Strydom, could place a copy of that Exhibit before you, I would appreciate that.  If not, I will read it, it is fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>	I will read it to you and then it will be translated.  You say on page 4 of this Exhibit E, paragraph 12, that which I can say, happened on Wednesday evening.  That Wednesday was the 17th of June 1992, it was just after nine o'clock in the evening.  You are recounting what happened that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>	So far what I have read to you, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Okay, I will go on.  You continue, you say I was at the kwaMadala hostel, I live there in a room, it is room number 8.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That Wednesday at that time, I was at the stadium inside the hostel, that would be at about nine o'clock in the evening, you say you were at the stadium inside the hostel.  Would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you go on to say, I and other people who were living at that hostel, had decided that the people were preventing us from leaving the hostel to go to the shops, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We then decided to attack the people who lived in the vicinity of the hostel.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You can accept when I say the following, that there is no mention made in this statement of any other reason for the attack, other than the fact that people were being prevented from going to the shops.  That was your sole reason as stated in this statement for the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a>	My question to you is, why did you not make any mention of the fact that you launched the attack for two reasons, (a) because you, yourself were terrified that you would be killed if you did not launch the attack, and (b) that IFP members were being killed by people from Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>	Why did you make no mention of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think it was just an omission on my part.  It is a fact that people were being killed.  It is not something that I am making up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it a fact that, and I think your words were, IFP members were dying every day, being killed every day by people in Boipatong, is that a fact?  You say yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, although it may not have been daily, but it happened frequently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> They were being attacked by people from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were living in the area, you say from 1990.  Before you moved into kwaMadala, you were staying in Sebokeng, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the hostel, kwaMasisa hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, at Sebokeng hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You will know that many people were killed at the Sebokeng hostel on the 4th of September 1990, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember it well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In fact a total of 43 people were killed and many were wounded.  It was a confrontation between Inkatha, the IFP, and hostel residents at Sebokeng hostel.  Do you not remember that at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I remember that there was a lot of fighting at the hostel and when we were attacked and had to flee, a lot of people were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you will remember that before that, on the 22nd of July 1990, there was an IFP rally in Everton, Zone 7, do you remember that?  That was, if I am correct, the first IFP rally in the Vaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was not in Everton, but in Zone 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Zone 7 Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, in Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I beg your pardon.   That was when the violence started in the Vaal, am I correct, after that rally or from the time of that rally, 22 July 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> After the deaths on the 4th of September 1990, is it correct that there were many IFP members arrested including a person by the name of Sibusiso Qunchu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And is it correct that Sibusiso Qunchu and Damara Qunchu are the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then there were many other incidents of violence that happened in Sebokeng, in Everton, around the Sebokeng hostel, but there was no violence around Boipatong, and I am talking now right up to the beginning of 1991.  No violence around Boipatong, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would say that that is correct to a certain extent, because we were being attacked by the entire Vaal Triangle area.  It could have been the people from Bopuleni, Boipatong or wherever else in the Vaal Triangle.  Everyone who was Inkatha or Zulu speaking, was being attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't the position rather Mr Mkhize, that the IFP had no real presence in the Vaal, prior to July 1990 and then after that rally, I beg your pardon, in July, the 22nd of July 1990, the IFP established a presence in the Vaal by continuously waging a war against the residents of the Vaal.  Isn't that what was happening at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, that is not correct.  That rally was held to commemorate the burning down of our members' houses which had been burnt by the ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And also I am referring now to the beginning of 1991,  there was a gang operating based at kwaMadala hostel and headed by Victor Keswa, also known as Katisi.  Do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't have knowledge thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You don't have knowledge about Victor Keswa at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I know Keswa very well.  What I know was that there was a gang that he was with, the people who came from the township.    Whether he was their leader or not, I am not aware thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am asking you whether you know that Victor Keswa's gang operated from kwaMadala hostel?  Not that they worked at the hostel, that they were based, Victor Keswa and his gang were based at kwaMadala hostel and launched their attacks from kwaMadala hostel on residents of the Vaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't have knowledge of that sort.  If you have knowledge or evidence of such, I would not dispute it because they used to reside at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Victor Keswa and his gang did reside at kwaMadala hostel, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, they did reside at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would you describe the AmaButho as the military wing of kwaMadala hostel, would that be a fair description?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I could describe them as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And so you were the leader of the AmaButho, you as the Commander, you would have been aware of what fighting units were resident in kwaMadala hostel and what they were up to, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I would have known, except in circumstances where a person was secretly involved in criminal activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>	I knew all that there was to know about the AmaButho and the activities in the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On the 12th of January 1991, there was a night vigil for Christopher Ngalembe and at that night vigil, the people at the vigil were attacked, 35 people were killed and over 40 people were injured.  Do you know about that attack, it was in Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I heard about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you also heard that Victor Keswa's gang was blamed for that attack, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I heard about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know whether Victor Keswa and his gang were responsible for that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not have such knowledge.  I was away at home at that time, I returned when they had already been arrested and their trial was in progress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Victor Keswa was released after that.  Did you never question him about his participation in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I never discussed it with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that because you were afraid of him and his gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, he was a small kid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Victor Keswa was a small kid?  Did you say Victor Keswa was a small kid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, he was very young, much younger than I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you know that amongst the people arrested in relation to the Ngalembe night vigil massacre, was Darkie Qunchu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I was aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He was the brother of Damara Qunchu, Sibusiso Qunchu, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As well as Thomas Lukhozi, he was also arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was Thomas Lukhozi with you on the night of the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't remember, but I think he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Daniel Mabote, Themba Mabote, he was also arrested with Victor Keswa following the night vigil massacre?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> When those people were arrested, Victor Keswa was in hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That was in January, February 1991, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Although I cannot remember quite clearly, but I do know that Victor Keswa was in hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know a person by the name of Aaron Mtjale?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> What is the name again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Aaron Mtjale?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Maybe I know him by another name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that not the Mtjale who served on the senior committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know of an incident which occurred between the 4th and the 10th of March 1991, where Vanana Zulu went with Inkatha members from the kwaMadala hostel to some shebeens in Boipatong, and threatened that Inkatha would invade residents to teach them a lesson?  This is March 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not have any knowledge thereof.  I don't remember ever having accompanied Prince Zulu anywhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, did you ever discuss with Vanana Zulu, Prince Zulu, his attitude towards the residents of Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you ever discuss Prince Vanana Zulu's attitude towards the people of Boipatong, did you ever discuss that with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was something that we used to discuss and he would tell me that we should wait a while because he was still trying to find a way of discussing this issue with the leaders from Boipatong.  That is what we usually discussed with the Prince.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say that Vanana Zulu would say to you, you must wait?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did the applicant want to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We used to tell him that people were complaining that they were being attacked and killed daily and I was of the opinion that we should launch a revenge attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a>	The Prince said we should wait whilst he was still trying to meet leaders from Boipatong, with whom he will discuss this matter, so that the killing would stop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We are talking about the period 1990 to 1991, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know a man by the name of Ernest Tsotso?  Ernest Tsotso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know the name of any leader of the ANC in Boipatong during the period 1990 to 1992 or even 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not know any.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you as the leader of the AmaButho, you did not know who was leading the ANC in Boipatong, you did not know any single member of the ANC in Boipatong, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I did not know anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you make any attempt to find out who the leaders of the ANC in Boipatong were, who the leaders of the SDU's, Self Defence Units in Boipatong were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never discussed it with Prince Vanana Zulu or Victor Keswa or anyone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What position did Victor Keswa hold in the IFP, during the period 1990 to 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know him to having had any position.  I do not know if he had a position in the youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You don't know that on the 3rd of July 1991, Mr Ernest Tsotso's wife, his daughter and his six year old son, were shot dead at their home in Boipatong?  You don't know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not know about that.  I may have heard about it, because there was a lot going on at that time, but I may not have known exactly whose family it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The allegations were that Mr Victor Keswa and residents of the kwaMadala hostel were responsible for this attack on Mr Tsotso's family.  Did that ever come to your attention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I have already said that I do not know about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see because Mr Ernest Tsotso was a prominent leader of the ANC in Boipatong at that time.  You didn't know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I have already mentioned that I do not know any leader, ANC leader, from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mkhize, did you at any stage prior to the attack on Boipatong, receive information that there were people from the hostel who were attacking people in the township, from time to time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you at any stage prior to the attack, hear that there were allegations that people like Keswa were attacking people in the townships?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  I did not hear about it.  They may have done this covertly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I understand that you may not have been aware of those attacks, but what I am asking you is, did you at any stage hear of those allegations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you ever heard that there were allegations that there were people such as Mr Keswa who would attack townships?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  I only heard after they were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As a leader of the AmaButho in the hostel, did you make any enquiries from Keswa about these allegations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I have never questioned him, because they did not reside at the hostel all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you concerned about the allegations?  You see, you were in charge of - were you in charge of AmaButho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you said AmaButho were the military wing of the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If an attack was to be launched, AmaButho would be involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So if there was an allegation that an attack had been launched from the hostel, would that not concern you that AmaButho would carry such an attack without your approval?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you not try to investigate about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> With regard to this instance, I was not able to investigate because no one claimed to have knowledge of that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you investigate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you ask anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I did discuss it with Prince Vanana and he didn't have knowledge of who had committed the act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Victor Keswa and other residents of the kwaMadala hostel were arrested as you say, in relation to the Ngalembe night vigil, but they were then released and in fact, Prince Vanana Zulu asked the Court at their bail hearing, to release the accused into the car of the hostel dwellers at kwaMadala.  Do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  Victor Keswa was not arrested for that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What incident was he arrested for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am not very sure.  There were various crimes that he was arrested for, but he was not arrested for the incident at the night vigil, because he was in hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know of an incident in July of 1991, where approximately 300 men from kwaMadala hostel attacked the residents of Boipatong?  Do you remember such an incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is precisely the incident we are discussing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, no, July 1991, about a year, eleven months before the massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know a person by the name of Billy Mokuthedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You don't know of the allegation that he was killed by residents of Boipatong, July 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The same Billy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Was he an IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would it make a difference?  Do you know of a person by the name of Billy Mokuthedi who was allegedly killed by Boipatong residents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not know him.  Maybe I do know him, it could be that I do not recognise the name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am still in July of 1991, do you know anything about an incident where two people were killed and houses were damaged, when armed men went on the rampage in Boipatong, July 1990?  This is now the 29th of July?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you say 1990 or 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I beg your pardon, 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you remember a stay away that was organised by COSATU in August of 1991 where COSATU protested against ISCOR for allowing kwaMadala to be used as a base for attacks by members of the IFP on residents of the Vaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a>	I can tell you the stay away was on the 12th of August 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember.  It could have been at the time when we were in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Unless you have been in prison for other offences, I am talking about August 1991, before the massacre, about ten months before the massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In the middle of August, the 15th of August 1991, between 300 and 500 Boipatong residents marched to ISCOR.  They had a memorandum which they handed over to the ISCOR management, demanding the closure of kwaMadala hostel because kwaMadala was being used as a base for attacks by the IFP on residents of the Vaal.  Do you remember that protest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know that the, or were you aware at the time that the residents of Boipatong were unhappy about the fact that they were being attacked from kwaMadala hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.  There was a  lot of conflict between us and the residents of Boipatong.  I know that they were unhappy about us.  We also were unhappy about them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No Mr Mkhize, the attacks were coming from the kwaMadala hostel.  I will tell you the attacks from the residents of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>	One I told you was in relation to the death of Mr Billy Mokuthedi, that was the end of July 1991.  There had been attacks before that by certain elements in kwaMadala hostel on the residents of Boipatong and the residents of the Vaal in general, that is July 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>	The next incident in relation to Boipatong, was on the 12th of January 1992, when Mr Bongani Mbatha was killed.  That was the next incident.  So it is from July 1991 to January 1992 and during that time, and before July 1991, there are these attacks from kwaMadala hostel.  Can you comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know about that.  What I do know is that Bongani Mbatha was killed in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you know that he was killed on the 12th of January 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Are you referring to Bongani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am not certain of the date, but I do know that he was killed in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You said that you held meetings in the hostel, and residents were complaining about the fact that IFP members and supporters were being killed every day and you held one such meeting, two weeks before the attack on Boipatong, that would put it roundabout the 3rd of June 1992, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I did mention that there were several meetings that were held, although I cannot remember the exact dates of those meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a>	Therefore I cannot say which meeting was on which date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you do recall a meeting about two weeks before the massacre where residents were complaining about IFP members being killed by Boipatong residents, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> As I mentioned before, there could have been two or more meetings where residents had voiced these complaints.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What I am more concerned about is the timing of these meetings.   You conceded when you were being questioned by Ms Tanzer, that one such meeting could have been held about two weeks before the massacre where these complaints were being aired, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I do not dispute that.  What I am saying is I cannot remember exactly when these meetings were held.  It could have been two or three meetings or more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a>	It is not that I am denying that I said that before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> From the 12th of January 1992 until June 1992, there was a lot of violence in the Vaal, Sharpeville, Sebokeng, but not Boipatong.   Do you know of anyone who was killed, any IFP member who was killed in Boipatong or by residents of Boipatong after Mr Bongani Mbatha was killed and until the beginning, 3rd, 4th, 5th of June 1992?  Do you know of any IFP member who was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Although I cannot be certain whether people were killed before or after the death of Bongani Mbatha, there were people who were killed in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know of an incident on the 4th of June 1992, where four ANC members were allegedly kidnapped, tortured, taken to kwaMadala hostel and forced to join the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I beg your pardon it was in May 1992, do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not know about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The next IFP supporter to be killed, was Mr David Mbele, did you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he was killed on the 13th of June 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There were other IFP members who were allegedly killed, I beg your pardon, there is one other IFP member who was allegedly killed on the 13th of June 1992 in Boipatong, a woman.  Do you know of her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I know of a certain Nomvula.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then on the 14th of June 1992, a Mr Bea Khumalo was killed in Boipatong.  Did you know Mr Khumalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> My point is this Mr Mkhize, from the end of January 1992 until the beginning of June, in fact until the 12th of June 1992, no IFP members or supporters were killed in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>	How then was it possible at a meeting held approximately on the 3rd of June 1992, for residents of the kwaMadala hostel to come and complain about members dying daily at the hands of residents of Boipatong, when in fact that wasn't happening on the 3rd of June, and hadn't happened for months before the 3rd of June 1992.  That is my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not believe that we would just go out and attack people without a reason.  What I know is that we actually launched a revenge attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Oh you had a reason Mr Mkhize, let me suggest to you what your reason was.  Your reason was part of an IFP strategy for the Vaal, in fact for the Transvaal at the time, and that strategy was to import people from kwaZulu Natal into those areas, and let's concentrate on the Vaal, and to create chaos in the Vaal so as to destabilise the political processes that were on the way at the time.  Wasn't that the whole reason behind this attack, this massacre on Boipatong on the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is not true.  I regard it as an insult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know what was happening at the time politically in the country, June 1992?  Did you know about CODESA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would hear about it although I did not know what was going on.  I heard about CODESA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And there were negotiations underway, designed to produce a new constitutional dispensation for this country, to change the country from apartheid to a democratic South Africa?  You knew that that was going on at the time, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I was not aware of that happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the attack on Boipatong, I am putting to you, was designed to derail those negotiations, wasn't that the purpose for the attack on Boipatong?  It went far beyond you and the residents of kwaMadala, it was an IFP decision to attack Boipatong, so as to derail those negotiations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is an insult.  I regard it as an insult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All right, well, you yourself didn't want to attack Boipatong, am I right, you were forced to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And these requests for action against Boipatong, were being made to you over a long period of time, over many months before the attack actually took place, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you, as one of the most senior leaders of the IFP in the hostel, who did you discuss a potential attack on Boipatong, with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I already mentioned that I spoke to the residents, because the Prince who was actually the most senior person, was absent.  Therefore I discussed the matter with the residents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mkhize, we are talking about leaders now.  You have told the Committee that over many months, there was this feeling amongst the residents, I won't put it any higher than that, feeling that there had to be an attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a>	My question to you is, which leaders of the IFP, either in the hostel or outside the hostel, did you consult with at any time, before you decided to launch the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did not discuss it with any leaders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You knew that, this is according to you, that Prince Vanana Zulu was against an attack, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were against an attack, you have already said that that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why were you against the attack and why was Vanana Zulu against the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The problem I had was that people were going to be killed, but I also felt that my life was in danger.  The Prince can speak for himself as to his reasons for his unwillingness to go and attack Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Which people were going to be killed?  You said you were against the attack, because people were going to be killed.  Which people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did mention before that it was members of the Self Defence Units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were against killing them, but you decided it is better that they get killed instead of you getting killed, would that be fair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you were against killing them, because you thought, I ask you, that this would be contrary to IFP policy and would be counter to the aims and objectives of the Inkatha Freedom Party, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You knew that Moses Mthembu was a senior member of the IFP in the hostel, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> He was not an IFP leader, but he was in a senior position under the ISCOR management.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why didn't you discuss a possible attack with him, or ways in which you could avoid attacking Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was not easy for me to tell something of this nature to him, because he was elderly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Because he was older than you, you didn't discuss your fears in relation to an attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Because he was older than you, you didn't discuss your fears with him in relation to an attack on Boipatong, is that your reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why didn't you discuss the problem with Mr Themba Khoza for example, he was a leader of the IFP in the Vaal, you knew that, you could have spoken to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Themba Khoza was not a leader in the Vaal Triangle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was Themba Khoza's position at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> He was a senior leader in Johannesburg, in the Johannesburg area, not here in the Vaal Triangle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He used to come to kwaMadala before the massacre to speak to you, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You knew where to get hold of him, you knew that he was a senior leader, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I did know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why didn't you contact him and say Mr Khoza, I am having problems here at kwaMadala, I need your assistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> With regard to IFP leadership, it is not easy for you to actually inform leaders that you intend killing some people.  You only have to discuss such matters with people at your level.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a>	Mr Khoza was a senior leader, it was not something that would have been easy for me to do.  He would have regarded that as disrespect and I could have been disciplined for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand your evidence, the residents of kwaMadala hostel, had been complaining for some time about the fact that they can't leave the hostel and they are being attacked, whenever they are out of the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When this was first brought to your attention, this is now this complaint, who did you discuss it with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I called a meeting and we discussed the matter with the residents of the hostel.  I also informed Prince Vanana Zulu and the Prince said I should actually hold on because he was going to communicate with leaders in Boipatong, so that ordinary members would be called upon to stop the fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about the members of the Committee of which you were a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We did not discuss this in the committee.  I thought it was better to inform the Prince.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What position did he have at the hostel at the time, was he the most senior IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, he was the most senior person at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  How long before the attack, did Prince Vanana Zulu leave the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It could have been a week or two, I am not quite certain.  I do know that it was not less than a week, before the attack was launched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Victor Mthembu has told this Committee that he saw Prince Vanana Zulu leaving the hostel to catch a taxi, during the afternoon of the 17th of June 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That was not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Prince Zulu has left you with instructions, not to launch an attack, this is now on Boipatong, this is now a week, possibly two weeks before the actual attack on Boipatong, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> He did not issue an instruction that we should not attack on a specific date, but he asked us to wait until such time that he managed to communicate with leaders from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, now you have said a week, possibly two weeks before the attack, he had already left the hostel.  My question to you is, a week possibly two weeks before the attack, you had already decided to attack Boipatong, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, because of the suffering of the people in the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, if Prince Vanana Zulu has told you don't launch an attack, and he leaves, and the pressure on you gets too great that you have to launch an attack because otherwise you would be killed, why did you make no attempt to discuss the situation either with members of your own committee or with any other leader of the IFP, whether in the hostel or outside, such as Mr Themba Khoza?  Why did you not speak to anyone?  To be clear, not to say we are going to attack, but to say there is this pressure for us to attack, what can I do, can you help me?  Why didn't you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Mr Khoza was not a person who was readily available to us at any time.  He is the one who usually came to us to inform us of various matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you make any attempt to contact or to speak to any other leader of the IFP, either in the hostel or outside  or in Johannesburg, did you make any attempt to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It did not occur to me to do so.  After informing the Prince, I thought that there was no other person that I should inform, he was the one who would have informed other leaders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> With respect Mr Mkhize, that can't be so because he had gone on leave, he had gone home, and you knew that.  He wasn't going to inform anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I think I made a mistake by not thinking of telling any other leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would I be correct to say that in your mind, at the time you decided that you had no choice, but to launch an attack on Boipatong, it was your view that such an attack was not in the best interest of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Despite that, you failed to call upon any other leader of the IFP, including Mr Themba Khoza for their assistance, to prevent what you knew was not in the interest of the IFP, would that be fair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I put it to you Mr Mkhize, that that is not correct and that, let me be specific on what is not correct, you launched that attack because you had the permission, the authority of other leaders of the IFP, including Mr Themba Khoza and you knew that the attack was sanctioned by the IFP, isn't that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, that is what you wish for, it is not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I put it to you, let me ask you this, at the time of the attack, were you a loyal and disciplined member of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I put it to you that as a loyal and disciplined member of the IFP, you would not have participated in conduct which you knew, was not in the interest of the IFP, unless you had the authority from the IFP to do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did mention that I did this because of the pressure that I was experiencing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This pressure was building up over many weeks prior to the attack, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, would you like to take a break Mr Mkhize, are you tired?  Are you tired at the moment, would you like to take a break?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Just continue asking your questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, just a point which I would like to clarify.    You say that you were the leader of the AmaButho, who chose you to be the leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I was actually elected by AmaButho themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> If you can just clarify to this Committee, not all of us are Zulu speaking, what is a AmaButho, is it the military wing of the IFP or how do you define AmaButho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would describe them as protectors, not necessarily for the IFP, but for Zulu's in general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a>	But we are divided in groups, when we attend ceremonial gatherings, I would lead the AmaButho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> How many groups were there in kwaMadala hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> There was just one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And did it consist of all the men, or how was it formed, who would be a member of AmaButho?  Would it be all the men in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Every male person at the hostel, was part of AmaButho.   There would be differentiation along the lines of youth, and senior members, but in cases where we went to rallies or maybe to ceremonial gatherings, to the king himself, we would go as one group, AmaButho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> What were your duties as a leader of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> For instance, if we were going to attend a ceremonial gathering, I would advise them on what we were going to do.  	I would also act as a mediator if there was a quarrel amongst members of AmaButho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you.  Mr Mkhize, how were the AmaButho subdivided within the hostel?  You had the whole structure of the AmaButho and then how were they placed into smaller groups, if that did happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was not subdivided.  There would for instance be a youth wing or maybe there would be other groups, but the entire group of men was AmaButho, they were known as AmaButho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Am I correct if I say that AmaButho is the Zulu word for warriors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when warriors went into battle,  was there no system of dividing them up into smaller units, or did the warriors just fight as one unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It all depends on the leader.  He would be the one to decide how his men would go into battle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you as the leader of the AmaButho, did you divide your men into smaller units and each smaller unit, having a leader, who was ultimately responsible to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, there were only two groups.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There were two groups of warriors in kwaMadala, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I said there was only one group of AmaButho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am not talking about on the night of the massacre, perhaps you think I am referring to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, then there was just one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> One group of AmaButho in the hostel and there were no sub-leaders, the only Commander, it was you and the AmaButho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And there were no Regional Commanders, Area Commanders, Block Commanders, Unit Commanders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, there were none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I see it is one o'clock, perhaps this would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will come back at half past one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Berger?   Let me warn you that we intend to rise for a short adjournment at about half past three again, so do bear that in mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, if I can just interrupt, some of the people that weren't here this morning, arrived shortly after we started this morning.  I can just inform you Mr Chairperson, that the following persons are here now as well, applicant 10, Tshabangu and Sipho Buthelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Microphone not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, and in the meantime we have established that Sonny Michael Mkwanazi is apparently in Sasolburg prison and we still don't know where Tebogo Magubane is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I will deal with Buthelezi and Tshabangu in due course.  Proceed Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Chairperson, if I may interrupt for a second as well.  It has come to my attention during the lunch break, that my client, Mr Nosenga has been receiving threats from within and from warders, which is frightening him and the whole aspect of Truth and Reconciliation is now intimidating him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a>	I just want to place on record that he has been receiving threats and if the Commission can provide some kind of legal witness protection for him, as he is feeling endangered and intimidated right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is a serious matter.  Who is threatening your client?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Chairperson, I have been unable to gather exactly which persons, because that also intimidates him, he doesn't want to point finger, because obviously the threat is that real, but he has since yesterday and now since the statement has been released, been receiving threats that is making him scared for his life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a>	He has been receiving threats at the prison, but he has also been receiving threats I understand, here in this, well in his, in the other room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say that he is receiving threats from the prison warders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I did Chairperson.  He just used the word warders, he would not point exactly which ones he was talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are these threats, are they only come from the prison warders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Chairperson, as I said to you, it was hard to get this information out of him.  He is just sitting there, very scared and basically has indicated that you know, he has received threats and he is scared.  He indicated it is from the warders, it is from locals around here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> From locals around, people you know around.  Mr Chairperson, it seems that there have been various threats, it is not one or two threats.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But when you say from locals around, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> As I said Mr Chairperson, he refuses to divulge too much information for the very reason that, and pointing fingers, that it could - it scared him.  It has intimidated him, he would not even point to me, I asked him to point out who is threatening him, he refused to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is Mr (indistinct) of the TRC Investigative Unit, here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No sir, I did not meet him, but the person who is here, I know is Mr Jan Olckers.  That is Jan Olckers, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What are your full names sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR OLCKERS:</span> My name is Johan Olckers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I gather that you are attached to the TRC Investigative Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR OLCKERS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We have been informed by the legal representative of one of the applicants, Andries Matanzima Nosenga, that he has been and continues to receive threats and that he desires to be put onto the witness protection scheme.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a>	Would you on behalf of this Committee, investigate the matter in the presence of his legal representative, and then come back and report to us before we rise this afternoon?  If you could also after you have been investigating the matter, indicate to us what your recommendations are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR OLCKERS:</span> Yes, I will do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is Mr Nosenga here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR OLCKERS:</span> He is placed in a room, in a back room, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you convey to your client, that we have directed that an investigation be made into the allegations with a view to determining whether or not, he should be placed on a witness protection scheme as he requires and that he should cooperate with the Investigator and to that extent, you will be excused from remaining in attendance until that matter has been sorted out.  Hopefully you will report back to us before we rise, so that we can resolve the matter today if possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Thank you, I will do that, he is actually listening right now, he is watching the television, so he is hearing the message.  I will convey to him though personally, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, Mr Berger, I gather that you intend cross-examining this applicant on the affidavit, on the sworn statement by Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I do Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Does it matter that his legal representative will not be here at the moment, probably doesn't, does it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I don't think so Chairperson, because I am not going to challenge anything that is in the statement, I am rather going to confront the witness with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  What is the feeling of other counsel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I don't have any objection Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Neither do I, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I have no objection Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have an objection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I have none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It seems to me that this is a matter which has to be attended to as soon as possible.  Very well, you will be excused Ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you sir.  I understand Mr Berger, that you are very anxious to proceed, please proceed sir.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who are the people that you saw during the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was at night, and there were many of us.  There is no one particular person that I can claim to remember quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And at the stadium, before you left to go and attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, it was at night I said, it was still at night, and therefore I am not in the position to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say you can't name anybody, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It has been a very long time.  I can only remember the people with whom we were arrested, but I cannot remember the rest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The people with whom you were arrested, were they all involved in the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, the majority of them were involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And can you give this Committee the names of those people with whom you were arrested, who were involved in the attack on Boipatong and who were acquitted during the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not quite remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If I gave you the charge sheet in the criminal matter, with the list of all the accused, would you be able to go through that list, and identify those people who were involved in the attack and those who were not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I think I can remember some of them, but surely not all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I will make the list available to you and if you could do that exercise please, overnight.   I see that your legal representative is saying that you can't read?  Is there someone who is living with you, who can assist you to read those names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I can try to get hold of someone who can assist me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you.  During the lunch adjournment, I had an opportunity to read the sworn statement of Mr Nosenga, and he says in paragraph 2 of that statement that there were many meetings prior to the massacre, held at the hostel, when discussions were held about killings of ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a>	Do you recall those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I did refer to numerous meetings that we held, trying to address the killing of our members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You must listen to me Mr Mkhize, I said the killing of ANC members.  Let me read to you what Mr Nosenga says and then you can tell me if you agree or disagree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a>	He says there were many meetings held at the hostel, when discussions were held about killings of ANC members.  The kwaMadala hostel was used by the IFP, to launch attacks on residents of the township.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> May the question please be repeated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He says there were many meetings held at the hostel.  I am asking you whether this is correct or not, when discussions were held about the killings of ANC members?  The kwaMadala hostel was used by the IFP to launch attacks on residents of the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Next sentence, Themba Khoza chaired the IFP in the Vaal Triangle, and he was a frequent visitor at the hostel, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is not correct.  He used to come, but I do not remember him being present when such matters as killing people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, am I correct to say that you are reading the last sentence of paragraph 2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That is so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is the question that is put to you, this is what Mr Nosenga says in his statement, Themba Khoza chaired IFP in the Vaal Triangle, and he was a frequent visitor at the hostel.  There is no suggestion that he took part in the discussions to kill people.  That is all that you are being asked at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I don't dispute that, I believe is the translation?  I didn't hear anything, I got it from my colleague.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there an extra statement so that we can make it available to the Interpreters?  Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Just for the record Mr Mkhize, is it correct that you said that that last sentence is correct, that Themba Khoza chaired the IFP in the Vaal Triangle and he was a frequent visitor at the hostel, just that sentence, is it correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did not say that.  I said he was a leader of the IFP in the Transvaal, not in the Vaal Triangle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mkhize, please listen to the question.  What Counsel is asking you about, he is asking you about the statement made by Mr Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You must answer the questions that are being put to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> May you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The question is, I want you please to comment on this sentence, is it correct or not correct, Themba Khoza chaired the IFP in the Vaal Triangle and he was a frequent visitor at the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where is the mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It is not true that he frequented the hostel and that he was Chairperson of the IFP in the Vaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who was the Chairperson of the IFP in the Vaal at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The one person I knew to have been Chairperson of everybody or the IFP in the Vaal, was Mr Vanana Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And who was his senior within IFP structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would not know, except that he was the one who was high up, above us all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mkhize, you do know.  You know that above Mr Vanana Zulu, was Mr Themba Khoza, don't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, then why do you waste time and say you don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am saying here in the Vaal, I am talking about the Vaal.  I know that Khoza was the Senior Supreme, but I am talking about the Vaal.  I don't know what position Mr Zulu was in relation to other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You have just told the Committee that Mr Vanana Zulu was the supreme leader in the Vaal, you said he chaired the IFP in the Vaal, that is the supreme leader, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I still maintain that is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then above him would be Mr Themba Khoza for the Transvaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Mr Themba Khoza used to come to the hostel, kwaMadala hostel on a number of occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> He did not come often.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He came to the hostel three days before the massacre, did he not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me read to you what one of your co-applicants says, page 8 of the bundle, paragraph 11.  On the Sunday before the Boipatong massacre, Themba Khoza and Dlamini came to address the meeting of the people in the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a>	Other residents of the kwaMadala hostel were present.  Only the men of the kwaMadala hostel were present.  Dlamini was accompanied by a member of the kwaZulu police, Gabelo, who was his bodyguard.  Did that not happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  Dlamini is actually the one person who used to come to the hostel, but then he was not a frequent visitor, he would come maybe once or twice a week, or maybe one week would lapse without him coming, and he would come thereafter, because he was a resident around here, in Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am reading from the affidavit of Mr Victor Mthembu, paragraph 12.  He says that Dlamini first opened this meeting, this was on the Sunday, it would be the 14th of March 1992, 14th of June, I beg your pardon, 1992.  He said there was a meeting because our people were dying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a>	They were being killed by the ANC people and Umkhonto weSizwe, do you remember that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Dlamini said this problem must be reported to Buthelezi.  He said the people had no transport to go to work, as all their taxi's were being hijacked by the ANC, and the people could not go to work.  This Buthelezi that is being referred to, is Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is reference to the Chief Minister, Mr Mangosuthu Buthelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were at the hostel on Sunday the 14th of June 1992, were you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> My problem is that I have lost count of the date, and therefore I cannot dispute some of these dates, but yes, I do not remember quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am talking about three days before the massacre, when you were preparing for war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Was Dlamini present in that meeting?  No, I do not agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did you take a decision that Boipatong would be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> On that very same day, that is on the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You did not take the decision before the 17th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> There is one other meeting that we held, but we did not decide as to which date we should, on which date we should launch the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did you decide that you were going to attack Boipatong?  Not of the date, but when did you decide that you would go ahead with an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was on the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We know that on the 17th you took the, you decided that you must now proceed to Boipatong and launch the attack.  What Counsel wants to find out, when was the decision in principle to attack Boipatong, taken?  Is that your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Indeed yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Even though I cannot quite remember very well, but I think it must have been the following day after the last meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How many days before the attack, did you take a decision in principle that Boipatong would be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember quite well really, I cannot remember how many days lapsed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question to you is, on the 17th you went to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before the 17th, was there already a decision that Boipatong was going to be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The legal representative wants to know when the decision to launch the attack, was taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is exactly what I am saying, I cannot remember the day of the week, or how many days lapsed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, was it a week or two weeks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think it was one week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have the answer?  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see a lot of your colleagues talk about a meeting on the 10th of June, do you remember that meeting, a week before the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I cannot remember very well, but I know there was not only one meeting held.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There was a meeting round about the 3rd of June 1992, there would have been a meeting on the 10th of June 1992, there would have been a meeting on the Sunday, the 14th of June 1992 and then there would have been the meeting in the stadium, on the 17th of June 1992.  Would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I would concur with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you had about a week or six days, in which to prepare for the attack on Boipatong, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If Themba Khoza came to the stadium, I beg your pardon, to kwaMadala hostel on Sunday the 14th of March 1992, as Mr Victor Mthembu says he did, you would then have had an opportunity to speak with him, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The month that my learned colleague referred to was March.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am sorry, I don't know why I am obsessed with March.  June, Sunday the 14th of June 1992.  Let me try and refresh your memory about what happened at that meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a>	After Mr Dlamini had addressed the meeting, Mr Themba Khoza says Mr Victor Mthembu, also addressed the meeting.  Themba Khoza he says, was angry at the killing of his people and he says if the people come and attack you, you are supposed to fight back and kill them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a>	Do you remember that meeting now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not.  I do not recall a meeting where Mr Themba Khoza indicted to us that we should fight back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga in his affidavit, page 19, paragraph 5, talks about the meeting approximately two weeks before the massacre, we are talking about roundabout the 3rd of June 1992.  He says that this meeting was in a big hall, lots of people there and he says Themba Khoza was at that meeting.  He also says that there were some policemen at the meeting, and he mentions Mr Peens and a certain Dani.  Is he correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  I do not remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you know Mr Peens, do you know Mr Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  I don't know him, except maybe I just know him by sight because I know several policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He says that Themba Khoza and Mr Peens, this is Mr Pedro Peens, chaired the meeting, and that Mtwana Zulu, that would be Prince Vanana Zulu, was also there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a>	He says that Darkie, a leader of the IFP, was also there.  You know Darkie, don't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Are you referring to Darkie Qunchu, if that is the one, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Kachene, an Induna, do you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I know Kachene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was he an Induna?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was he a member of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What is his surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It is Ndlovu.  Ndlovu is his surname and Kachene is his praise name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what other name does he go by, his first name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't know his real name, we used to call him Kachene, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is he one of your co-applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, he is not part of the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was he accused in the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga says that at this meeting, the hostel residents were told that people were needed to go to Boipatong to kill the dogs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't want to involve myself in this Nosenga issue, really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you see Mr Mkhize, I am putting this to you so that you will have an opportunity to comment on what Mr Nosenga says.  If you don't want to comment, that is also fine, just say I don't want to comment and I will move on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a>	Also at this meeting, Themba Khoza said that a certain insect should be killed and he was referring to the Boipatong residents?  Do you have any comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  There is nothing I know to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga says that Peens also spoke at that meeting, he spoke in Afrikaans, it was translated for the residents.  Do you remember a policeman speaking in Afrikaans at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember a single police present at the meeting.  I do not recall any policeman present at our meetings at kwaMadala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I won't go through all the details, but save to say that Mr Nosenga talks about the police saying, or Mr Peens saying that the police would supply you with caspirs, you the residents with caspirs and weapons and that the police would assist you during an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a>	Are you saying that that never happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What are you saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I say I know nothing about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you were there at that meeting, two weeks before the attack and you say Themba Khoza wasn't there and Pedro Peens wasn't there either, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In your, what preparations did you make for the attack in the six days that you had at your disposal, what did you do to prepare the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We had to get arms, that is all.  There was nothing else to do, there was no other preparation to be made really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you gave instructions to Damara Qunchu to get arms, to go and buy arms, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, but we already had some of the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you had to get more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, there was no need to (indistinct) the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well then, what did you do in the six days before the attack, you said you had to get arms, where did you get them from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did say earlier on that one person who had knowledge about firearms, was Mr Qunchu himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And did he go and get arms, and if so, from where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am saying he is the one who had knowledge as to where to find firearms, I don't know where he found them really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So all you did was you said Damara, we need arms, go and get arms and he went on his way and got the arms, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> There were already firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> At the hostel, at kwaMadala hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you said to him Damara, go and get all the arms in the hostel, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We already had firearms where we resided at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am sorry, I am being very obtuse, all you said to him was go and fetch the arms which are hidden in the hostel and he went about his business, is that what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, we already had firearms at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You know you were asked questions about weapons in this request for further particulars, on page 68 in particular, question 19.  You were asked did you have an AK47 automatic rifle on the evening of the 17th of June and your answer was yes.  It was in the hostel.  I didn't see when Damara Qunchu arrived, but he was responsible to organise weapons, including AK47's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a>	You were asked where did you get this weapon, 19.1.  You didn't answer that as far as I can see.  You were asked in question 19.2, did Mr Damara Qunchu bring weapons to the hostel in a vehicle, a blue Nissan Skyline.  I am not sure if you answered that question because you said you didn't see when he arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a>	I will ask you again, did Mr Damara Qunchu go out of the hostel to organise guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At what stage Mr Berger?  He has told us previously that whenever they wanted arms, they would collect money, give it to Damara Qunchu to go and buy the arms, he didn't know where they were bought from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a>	What is the stage that you are talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Between the time when you decided that you needed arms to launch an attack on Boipatong, we are talking about six days before the attack, or after the meeting of the 10th of June, seven days before the attack.  Between that time, the 10th of June and the 17th of June, did Mr Damara Qunchu leave the hostel and return with guns in a blue Nissan Skyline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember very well, but yes, he used to use a blue Skyline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Besides giving an instruction to Mr Qunchu to say go and get the arms, what other preparations did you make for the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We did not make any other preparation.  There was no need for any other preparation because we already had firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well there was a need Mr Mkhize, let me give you some examples.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a>	You had to plan the route for one, you had to plan the targets for two, where would you attack the SDU's.  You didn't plan any of that, routes or targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We knew too that we were going to find the Self Defence Units in the townships, that is all.  We knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the route to Boipatong, you were just going to go out the main gate and walk to Boipatong?  That was what you had decided?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We took the route to the township, we know the route to the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We know that you just walked to Boipatong, but what Counsel is asking you is, did you not plan where you were going to get the SDU and which route you were going to follow to get to them?  Did you not plan that beforehand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, we did plan those because we knew that they used to patrol at the entrance.  That is where they used to put up barricades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you say we planned, it is you and Mr Damara Qunchu, no one else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What about the guards at the main gate of kwaMadala hostel?  Surely they were going to be suspicious when a couple of hundred armed men leave the hostel, after nightfall?  Did you arrange with them what was going to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What about the Vaal Commando?  You knew, I am sure, I will ask you, did you know that the Vaal Commando patrolled the street outside the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  I did not have that knowledge, except to say we had knowledge to the fact that there were some police who used to patrol the streets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Police and military vehicles used to patrol the area around the hostel, around ISCOR, around kwaMadala, around Boipatong.  You knew that, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, we did have that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What made you think that several hundred armed men moving out of the main gate, along the main road to Boipatong, were not going to be stopped by either members of the army or by members of the police?  How did you think you could do that with impunity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It just did not occur to us.  It did not occur to me as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mkhize, you are the Commander of a military unit, a fighting unit.  You are leading a couple of hundred armed men out to commit murder, and it never occurs to you that the police might catch you in the act, it never occurs to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, it did not occur to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I will tell you why it did not occur to you Mr Mkhize, because you already had assurances from the police that not only would you not be stopped on your way to commit murder, but that you would be assisted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On the 14th of June, this is now the Sunday before the attack, says Mr Nosenga, paragraph 8, page 19, he also says there was a meeting at the hostel and he says that at this meeting, it was decided that the attack should take place on the 17th of June 1992.  Is he correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well then why do you say  he is not correct?  We know that there was a meeting on the 14th of June, Mr Mthembu says so as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a>	This is the Sunday, three days before the attack there was a meeting at the hostel, we know that, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not disagree with the fact that there was a meeting on that day, but all I am saying is that I have lost count of the dates during which certain things happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We know from your own evidence that by the Sunday, you had already taken a decision to attack Boipatong, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Will you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We know from you that by the Sunday, you had already taken a decision to attack Boipatong, the 14th, by the 14th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And is it not correct that on the Sunday, you told the residents that the attack would take place on the Wednesday, the 17th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why didn't you tell the residents that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I told them on the day of the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> My question to you is, why at this meeting on the Sunday, did you not tell the hostel residents on Wednesday, three days from now, we will go and attack Boipatong, get yourselves ready?  Why didn't you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was not easy.  This is not something to be done in advance, they ought not to have been informed in advance, because the information would leak and we might end up being arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The information would leak to the police and you might end up being arrested, is that what you thought at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you never thought that the police would arrest you on your way to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, it did not occur to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga says that at that meeting on the Sunday, the residents were told that in this attack on Boipatong, everyone was going to be killed, women and children included?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am not going to go through the further particulars of that meeting, save to say that he says that at meeting, there were no police officers present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a>	Were you an Induna Mr Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> During the criminal trial, you will remember that Prince Vanana Zulu gave evidence and at page 3126 of the criminal record, he was asked the following question:  Accused 9 and that was you at the trial, told the Court that there in the hostel, he is an Induna, Mr Mkhize, and Prince Vanana Zulu's answer was no, I don't know him as an Induna.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a>	Do you dispute that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I dispute that.  I am an Induna at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Prince Vanana Zulu also was asked, or he said that you were correct when you told the Court that you took over certain functions from him, the functions that he had previously fulfilled in the hostel, you took over from him?  That is correct is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That is what he said at the trial.  What he also said at the trial, he was asked the question can Mr Mkhize, this is now accused 9, on his own, can he take decisions in the hostel about when a meeting should be held.  I hope I have translated it correctly.  I am getting the nod, so my translation is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a>	He was asked that question and his answer was no, telling the Court that you had no authority to decide on your own when meetings in the hostel would be called, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that would mean that you had no authority in IFP structures, you had no authority from the IFP to call a meeting of the hostel, on your own, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And so are you therefore saying that when you called the meeting in the stadium on the evening of the 17th of June 1992, prior to the attack on Boipatong, you had no authority from the IFP to call that meeting, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct, but then the Prince was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Even in the absence of the Prince, you had no authority, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And everybody who attended the meeting, would have known that, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga goes on, page 20 paragraph 9, to say on the day of the attack, we alerted by a trumpet signal at about six to seven o'clock.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We gathered at the stadium at the hostel area, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When Themba Khoza arrived at the hostel, he gave certain commands to the Indunas who informed us that Khoza had obtained the guns and some of them were from Peens.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He says that Peens came to the hostel on the day of the attack, together with his colleague Shaka.  Did you see Mr Peens at the hostel on the day of the attack, this was now before the attack, I would assume?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did say that I don't know that Mr Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see any white man at the hostel on the day of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did say that I do not remember any meeting being held in the presence of a white person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am not talking about a meeting now, I am talking about the simple presence of a white man who arrived in a white Opel Monza on the day of the attack, at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He says he came with his colleague, a policeman by the name of Shaka.  Did you know a black policeman by the name of Shaka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he says that on that day, he saw Peens hand over money to Victor Keswa.  From that I infer and I am asking you, that Victor Keswa was indeed present at the hostel on the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not remember really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say you do not remember, but do I take it when you say that, it means you cannot dispute as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I disagree with that statement, I do not recall seeing Keswa on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you do not dispute that Keswa was there, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I disagree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He goes on in paragraph 11 to say that at the stadium, we were told that if we drank muti, we would become brave and strong.  We drank and also poured muti on our weapons.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was a medicine called Ntelezi.  This medicine is the kind of medicine that we use often times at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What is the Ntelezi used for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> When AmaButho goes out for whatever reason, we use this.  We still use this Ntelezi even now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it not correct that the Ntelezi is used to make the AmaButho brave so that they will be protected and do well in war, isn't that what it is for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is our belief as Zulu's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And in fact, that was your belief on the night and the Ntelezi was used, it was drank and it was also poured or sprinkled over the weapons, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am saying that any instance where AmaButho would have to go out, we use this Ntelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am asking you about the night of the attack, on that night, did the residents drink Ntelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is what I am saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And did they sprinkle the Ntelezi or pour the Ntelezi over their weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We only sprinkle it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There were a number of people who were given AK47's, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There were also people with revolvers and shotguns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I think so, even though it was night, I am not in the position to specifically indicate who was carrying what kind of a weapon.  I think yes, that was the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And we know that there were also spears and axes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then he says we all left by feet in the direction of the township, that is also correct, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he says we were about 100 people.  Most of us were from the hostel, but I believe that there were some people from Natal amongst the attackers.  Correct or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, the majority of us came from Natal, that is why we resided at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Some of the attackers were wearing red head bands, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Not some of them, all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it that some were wearing red and some were wearing white or am I wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember quite well, but I remember using red head bands, but yes, all of us were wearing head bands, I cannot remember whether there were some white head bands.  I don't want to agree with you when you say there were white head bands used as well, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It is not me who says that, it is Victor Mthembu who says that.  I will move on.  He says we walked on the road and passed under the bridge, which is located a few minutes' walk from the hostel, that is correct, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When we came out on the big open field before the township, I saw four to six caspirs parked on the field.  Your comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did say earlier on that I saw only one caspir, it was just driving passed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a>	I don't know anything about two or three or four caspirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It is correct that you came out into a big open field before you entered Boipatong, am I right?  After you passed under the bridge, you came out into an open field?  Just before?  Isn't it that you went behind the nursery and then you moved towards the lower side of Boipatong, or is that not the way it happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not recall that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where do you say you entered Boipatong, do you say it was at the top of Boipatong not at the bottom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a>	When I talk about the top, I mean along that road where the factories are, Cape Gate and all of those factories, you entered Boipatong from that side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> If you are  following the route from Vanderbijl, I would say yes, that is the route that we took to gain our entry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You have told the Court that you know where Umzimvubu Street is, right, the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you enter Boipatong along Umzimvubu Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, further down.  It was further down Umzimvubu Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You spoke about a caspir that you saw whilst you were moving towards Boipatong, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you remember what colour caspir it was, or what type of caspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember.  I cannot remember whether it was a military caspir or a police caspir, I cannot recall really, it was at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And this caspir was moving alone, would it be Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, the main road that separates kwaMadala hostel from Boipatong, is that the road that the caspir was moving along?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And moving in which direction, moving towards...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It headed towards Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In other words up towards the top of Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And weren't you afraid that you might get caught?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did indicate earlier on that this did not occur to me.  I think you are asking me this question for the second time now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, I am asking you now, when you saw this caspir, you were still not afraid that you might get caught, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We did think that it might be possible for us to be arrested, but the caspir proceeded on.  Had it stopped, yes, we could have concluded that now we were going to get arrested, but the caspir did not stop at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I put it to you that the caspirs were there, that in fact, there was more than one caspir, and that in fact, members of the AmaButho, some of them, actually got into the caspir and were transported into Boipatong.  Isn't that what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, that is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know a policeman by the name of Rooikop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What is his real name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I only know him to be Rooikop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is this a black or a white policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> He is a white one.   I know a white one.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is he thin or is he fat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> He is stout, not very big.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He was present during the attack, am I right?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Kachene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did say earlier on that I do not remember Kachene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You don't know who that person is, or you don't remember if he was there during the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did say that I know Kachene, My Lord, but all I am saying is that I cannot remember whether he was present on the day of the attack or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Themba Kubeka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I know him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And both of them were present during the massacre, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I think so.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  On coming back from home, I learnt that he had died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he was present during the massacre, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Tsamo.  Do you know Tsamo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not remember that one, I don't think I know him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">BHEKINKOSI MKHIZE:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> (continued)  Mr Mkhize, I take it that  you deny that there were any policemen involved in the attack on Boipatong?  You deny that there were any caspirs involved in the attack on Boipatong and you deny that there were any people wearing balaclavas who took part in the attack on Boipatong, would that be right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If there had been caspirs involved in transporting some of the attackers to Boipatong, you would have seen that, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I would have seen them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If there had been policemen involved, or whites involved, or people wearing balaclavas, you would have seen them, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And so the fact that you did not see any of this, means that they were not there, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I want to put it to you that you are not telling the truth with the Committee and that there were in fact policemen involved, there were whites involved, there were people wearing balaclavas, whites wearing balaclavas and there were caspirs which transported attackers to the township.  You don't wish to comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> My intention to come before this Committee is to seek amnesty and therefore would have no reason to hide any information if I had it.  I would have no reason to fear anybody including the policemen.  If there were policemen involved, I would say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a>	As I have already mentioned that I was present, I was armed with an AK47 and I do not know why I will be afraid to divulge information if I had it.    I am here to tell the Committee, to inform the Committee of what I saw and what I know.  Therefore I cannot say that the police were there if I did not see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You have every reason not to tell the truth Mr Mkhize, because if you do tell the truth, you fear that something will happen to you, something bad will happen to you.  We have seen with Mr Nosenga.  He has made an affidavit which sets out the truth, he is being threatened with his life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a>	Isn't that what you fear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, it is not what I fear.  I don't even want to involve myself in Nosenga's issue, because I don't even know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Two of the policemen who gave evidence at the Goldstone Commission about police involvement in the attack, are dead today.  That is the reason that you are not telling the truth.  You are too scared to tell the truth and you are too scared to tell this Committee that that is the reason, isn't that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am not afraid of anything.  I do not fear anything, I would say if there were policemen involved.  I don't really understand what I would be fearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You do know that you can be put into a witness protection programme if you tell the truth, if you fear for your life?  You know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You can be put into a witness protection programme if you are fearing for your life, you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not know that.  With regards to what you are discussing here, there is nothing that I am afraid of.  I would not fear to divulge that the police were present if they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you not afraid of Prince Vanana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  Would I be afraid that maybe he would assault me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> While we are on the subject of Prince Vanana Zulu, is it not correct that he was in fact part of the attack, that he was in Boipatong during the massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I have already told you that he was absent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What do you know about women who were raped during the massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> During the criminal trial, Lucky Stikenawu, Sonny Michael Mkwanazi, was asked the following question at page 3499 - he was asked, Gobi also said that on the 18th of June, that would have been the day after the massacre, you had a conversation with him and you told him that the previous night you had raped somebody in Boipatong.  Do you remember that evidence at the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That Lucky had said to someone who gave evidence for the State, that he had raped somebody in Boipatong, you don't remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did any of your men brag after the massacre that they had raped women in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not remember anyone doing that.  I did not get to hear of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would it surprise you, does it surprise you that women were allegedly raped in Boipatong during the massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, it would surprise me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you give instructions that women should not be raped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not.  It was not something that would happen, if you go out to attack, you would also engage in raping women.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you give instructions that there should be no looting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that also unusual?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Normally when you are engaged in fighting, there is no time to be also engaged in looting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So did it surprise you to learn that there was large scale looting during the massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, it did surprise me when I heard that some people's property had been looted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you give any instructions that women and children and old people should not be harmed during the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Even though there was no direct instruction to that effect, the people that we had actually targeted were SDU members, who I suppose were not children and were not elderly people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you give any instructions that no property should be damaged during the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We did not discuss property, we did not discuss people's property when we were actually discussing the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say it surprised you that people plundered and looted property during the attack, that surprised you, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why do you say in your statement, on page 77 at the bottom, that you gave the instruction to plunder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> This must have been a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Oh no, let me read to you what you said in your statement.  An instruction was given by me, to break the windows of the houses, and to loot and plunder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a>	You confirmed this statement this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not have knowledge thereof, I did not instruct anybody to break windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Just as you didn't instruct anybody to rape and just as you did not instruct anybody to kill women and children and old people, just the same?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I didn't do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it correct that anyone and anything, no matter how old, how young, anyone was a target in Boipatong?  Wasn't that the order when the attack began?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, that was not the instruction.  The people that we targeted in Boipatong, were SDU's.  I do not dispute that other people were also injured, because as it happened, it was dark and we could not see clearly who was who.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You don't dispute that there were IFP members living in Boipatong, who were injured or killed during the attack?  You don't dispute that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do dispute that.  There was no IFP member residing in Boipatong at that time, because people had been killed and some of them had even fled the area, they had actually fled to kwaMadala hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a>	I don't believe that there was any IFP member living in the area at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Themba Khoza the leader of the IFP in the Transvaal said both during the criminal trial, and in press statements immediately after the attack, that there were IFP members and supporters living in Boipatong and it was ludicrous to think that the IFP could be responsible for an attack on their own people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a>	Was Mr Khoza not telling the truth when he said that there were IFP members living in Boipatong and sympathizers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would not be able to dispute that, that must have been his knowledge, but as far as I know, there were no IFP people living in Boipatong at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a>	He must have been referring to something that he knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it correct Mr Mkhize, that there was no way in which you and the other attackers could say as you rampaged through Boipatong and Slovo Park, could say whether that particular person was a member of the ANC, a sympathiser of the ANC, a member of the IFP, a member of the SDU, you just didn't know.  You went through the township, killing everyone and anyone who didn't have a red or white band around their forehead, isn't that in reality what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> What I am saying is that there was no IFP member living in Boipatong at that time.  What I did mention also, was that there was no control at that time, when the attack took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that is because an order was given to kill everyone and anyone in Boipatong, in fact to destroy the entire township, isn't that what the order was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know how many times do I have to repeat myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, when you got into Boipatong, you fired you say in your statement, at a Self Defence Unit near the shops.  Am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did they fire back at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then did you run after them as they ran away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, we did chase after them, but we could not catch up with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where did they run to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Towards Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So then why did you and your men start destroying houses and going into houses in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I said I do not know about that, because that happened because people were out of control, you could no longer control them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you too, you also went through the township?  You were moving through the township and you were firing as you moved through the township, isn't that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You yourself, were moving through Boipatong and you were firing as you were going along.  Were you also out of control?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At page 78 you say, a third of the way down, you said it was dark and we were many.  We moved through the residential area and there was sporadic gunfire.   You yourself were going through, is that right, shooting as you went?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I said I actually fired when I saw people near the shop, but I did not shoot at random in the streets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you only fired at the shops, is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is right.  I would say yes, I did shoot near the shops and although I cannot remember if that was the only time, I cannot remember firing at any other point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you don't know if you killed anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never fired any shots in Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I did fire when we were at Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never saw any dead people in Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You only learnt the following day that people had died during the attack, you did not know that night that people had been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I want to read to you what you said in your statement to the police, Exhibit E.  You said we were a big group - let me start at page 4 - you are talking about being at the stadium and you talk about a person Situndwa Zulu.  Who is Situndwa Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't remember such a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who is Samsondwase Ngema?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Samson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Samsondwase Ngema?  You don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say in your statement page 5, that I had an AK47 with me with a magazine which was full of AK47 bullets, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In other words, this is the truth what I have just read?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also say page 5, that you left the stadium and you went across the road, you crossed the road which runs next to the hostel, to where the houses begin, which is correct, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you say when we came to the houses, those who had assegai's went into the houses, to stab the people.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It is the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think so, although a long time has elapsed since.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you say I and the others who waited outside, shot at those people from the houses, who ran outside and were trying to run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a>	So what you are saying is some AmaButho with spears, went into the houses to stab the people and as the people were coming out of the houses to run away, you and others stood there with your AK47's, and shot at them.  That is the truth, isn't that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So it is not true that you only fired shots at the shops and in Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did also say that I also fired with my firearm when we were going towards Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say in the statement that you fired five shots with your AK47 at people who were running away?  Is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't think it was five times.  It could have been more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you empty your magazine in Boipatong and Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How did the attack come to an end, how did you know that the attack was ending?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> When we assembled at Slovo Park, we just turned back and returned home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Hundreds of you in Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All the AmaButho finally got to Slovo Park, is that what you are saying, and then you turned back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, we returned to the hostel thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you hadn't attacked the whole of Boipatong, certain areas were left out, why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We realised that if we were to continue, we would end up being arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when did you realise this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> When we assembled at Slovo Park, we decided that we should actually return to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It suddenly dawned on you after an hour to an hour and a half, that the police might come and arrest you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that occurred to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On your way back to kwaMadala, did you see any police or army vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The problem with you is that you ask me one and the same question.  I did say that I only saw one car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The problem Mr Mkhize is that you don't listen to my question.  My question is as you were moving back to kwaMadala, did you see any police or army vehicles?  The vehicle that you spoke about was the vehicle that you saw when you were moving towards Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I said I saw that vehicle on our way back.  It was proceeding towards Sebokeng.  I did not say I saw it on our way to Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So if that vehicle had stopped, the one that you saw on your way back, if it had stopped, then you would have done what, because I remember your answer before was, if the vehicle had stopped, then we wouldn't have continued to go and attack?  Please explain what you would have done if it stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He didn't, he didn't say that.  He said we would have run away.  We would have known that we would be arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, my recollection of the witness' evidence is that on their way to Boipatong, they saw this vehicle moving along Frikkie Meyer Boulevard.  If the vehicle had stopped, they would have known that they would have been arrested, they wouldn't have continued going towards Boipatong.  The vehicle continued driving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He didn't add the part that you are adding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The witness said that they were on their way to Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> His original evidence was that he saw this motor vehicle when they were on their way, that is what he said initially.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Not on their way to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was his initial evidence.  Under cross-examination when there was a confusion, when he said this motor vehicle was proceeding towards Sebokeng I think it was, and it was put to him that they were on their way to Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he said yes?  Anyway, it is on record.  Mr Mkhize, then to clarify, is it your evidence that on your way from kwaMadala to Boipatong, you saw no vehicles, no army, no police vehicles as you were approaching Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.  I did not see any vehicle.  I did not see any army vehicle, nor police vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the caspir that you referred to, that you saw driving towards Sebokeng, that is the caspir that you saw on your way back to kwaMadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I put it to you that you are changing your evidence, but I will argue that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a>	The caspir that you saw, or the only caspir that you saw, you say if it had stopped, then you might have been arrested, but it didn't stop, it continued going towards Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If it had stopped, what would you have done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We would have run away.  There was no other option, except to flee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We know that there was in fact a military vehicle stationed near the corner of Frikkie Meyer Boulevard and Nobel Boulevard, that is where that Trek garage was, we know that that - I believe it is either a caspir or a buffel, was stationed there as you were making your way back to kwaMadala.  Are you saying that you never saw that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not see it.  The only vehicle that I saw, is the one that I mentioned before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that is the vehicle which did not stop, it continued driving towards Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In fact, we know that soldiers got out of that vehicle and stopped the traffic from proceeding, this is the vehicle traffic from proceeding along Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, in your direction.  You never saw that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So there was no reason for you to run, and I take it you did not run?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We did not run because the vehicle did not stop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And hundreds of armed men, carrying looted property with blood dripping from spears and blankets, walked from Boipatong back to kwaMadala along the same route that they had taken to come out of kwaMadala, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Walked under the bridge again, along that road, and re-entered kwaMadala through the main gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Nobody went running and hiding in the marsh or the veld outside kwaMadala, you all entered through the main gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, we all went through the main gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How is it that you only became aware that property was looted from Boipatong, the following morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a>	Remember you said you only became aware the following morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.  I just heard rumours that some things had been looted from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you were the Commander of these men, surely you remained behind until all your men had got into the hostel, so that you could be satisfied that they had safely returned to base, isn't that what you did as a Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I should have, but it did not happen because we all went through the gate at the same time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you went from the gate, you went to the stadium, you went back to the stadium, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, that is not so.  We went to our rooms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me read to you what you said to the police, page 5.  When we were finished with the attack, the whole group returned to the hostel.  We again went or assembled at the stadium, and Situndwa told us to hide our weapons away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know anything about this statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, it is your statement.  Is there any reason why you would have lied about re-assembling at the stadium if you didn't re-assemble at the stadium?  There would be no reason to tell such a lie, would there be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did mention before that a lot of what was said or a lot of statements that were made to the police, were under duress because we were being assaulted at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a>	There was no person who could have given me an instruction because the only single person who was the Prince, was away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We know that large items were looted from Boipatong.  We know that there was a grandfather clock, there were TV sets, there were quantities of meat stolen from freezers, there was a lot of heavy stuff looted from Boipatong, big stuff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a>	Are you saying that you were unaware of anyone carrying such heavy stuff back to the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I said it a long while ago, that I was not aware of any property being looted when we returned to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga says that he himself, took a TV set and money, he put the TV into a caspir and he says that there were other TV's, hi-fi's, blankets in the caspir when he put his in.  He says that all of this looted property was transported back to the hostel in the caspirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would like you to disregard what Nosenga is saying, because even the fact that there were police present there, is a mistake, that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> By the way, whilst we are on the question of mistakes, in your statement on page 77, you talk about white bands, two thirds of the way down, white bands being handed out to wear as head bands before the attack.  Would that also be a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did not say it was a mistake.  I said there were those head bands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You specifically said there were no white head bands, didn't you or am I wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I said I did not remember clearly whether it was red or white head bands that were used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga says that after you returned to the hostel, you all washed using a certain muti which was provided for by Chief Mtwana Zulu.  You were all happy and chanting and singing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So when you got back to the hostel, there was no celebration that you had finally destroyed the enemy in Boipatong, you all just went back to your own rooms, there was no ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We just went back to our rooms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There was no discussion at all about the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  There was no discussion because it was late at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What did you do with your weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We stored our weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The next day, the 18th, is it correct that Themba Khoza came to the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember quite clearly, but I think he did arrive at the hostel, that was the day when he actually pleaded with us to cooperate with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were asked this question, question 22 on page 68, did Mr Themba Khoza and Mr Humphrey Ndlovu visit kwaMadala after the attack and your answer, page 74, paragraph 22, is yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a>	So you admit that Themba Khoza and Humphrey Ndlovu did come to the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That was the following day, that was when Themba Khoza said you must cooperate with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I think it was on the following day.  If not that day, it could have been the 19th, but I think it was on the following day of the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you were asked in paragraph 22.1, page 68, to give particulars of the nature of this visit and your answer was that they, that is Themba Khoza and Humphrey Ndlovu just wanted to find out what had happened.  We denied all allegations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you say that that is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You denied the allegations because you knew that the attack was not IFP policy, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you were asked did Mr Khoza warn hostel dwellers at a meeting that they should burn all the evidence that linked the attackers to the massacre, including goods stolen from the hostel, and clothes stained with blood, and that should read including goods stolen from Boipatong and clothes stained with blood, and your answer was no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a>	Mr Themba Khoza did not instruct that the evidence should be burnt.  Is that still your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You know that Mr Victor Mthembu contradicts you.  He says Themba Khoza did come, Themba Khoza did instruct that the evidence should be burnt.  Why should he say such a thing if it is not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know.  I did not hear Mr Khoza saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He is not alone on this, because - I am sorry, I am just trying to find out who it is - no, I am incorrect, what Mr Nosenga says is that the following day, paragraph 25, Themba Khoza came to collect the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a>	He says we were told that other policemen, not the policemen from Vereeniging, would come and search for weapons.  Khoza was very happy and praised the people at a rally that was held at the hostel the same day.  Your comment please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You do know of course, that a decision was taken to burn the evidence from Boipatong or do you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I already told you that I do not have any knowledge thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know that a decision was taken to burn the evidence from Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't know what else to tell you now, because you are asking me this question for the fourth or fifth time, and I have already told you I did not know that there was property that was looted from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a>	When I heard of it, I could not find the said property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know that that property was burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  I think I should not respond to your question any more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All right Mr Mkhize, I was giving you an opportunity to be clear, because at page 78 of your statement, you say the following - I learnt ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which statement is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Page 78, it is a statement attached to his amnesty application, middle of the page, I learnt first the following day, I heard first the following day that many people had been killed.  Then you say some of the residents had brought to the hostel, goods which had been in the houses of Boipatong.  Then you say, it was decided to burn the evidence.  That is why I was asking you that question so many times, Mr Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a>	Perhaps now you know about the decision to burn the evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not remember any such decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why is it in your statement then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know.  I do not know how it came about, I do not remember anything of this sort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You know very well that it was Themba Khoza who ordered that the evidence was burnt, and you don't want to reveal that now, correct?  No comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a>	By the way the statement that we are referring to, was made by you on the 23rd of May 1998 and it was confirmed by you this morning, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1713"><a name="pos1713"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> How did I confirm it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1714"><a name="pos1714"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were asked by your Advocate and you confirmed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1715"><a name="pos1715"></a>	You say you have no knowledge about the rally in Ulundi, approximately one month after the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1716"><a name="pos1716"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember because there many rallies that were held.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1717"><a name="pos1717"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did anyone ever tell you that at this rally, the leader of the IFP, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, had given a speech in which he thanked Mr Nosenga and others who were there for the good job that they had done in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1718"><a name="pos1718"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is not true.  The Chief would have never praised or thanked the people for doing something of this sort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1719"><a name="pos1719"></a>	No one amongst IFP members would have gone and informed the Chief about such an act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1720"><a name="pos1720"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am reading from paragraph 26 on page 22 of Mr Nosenga's statement.  He also says in that same paragraph that they travelled in a kombi, driven by Darkie, that would be Darkie Qunchu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1721"><a name="pos1721"></a>	He says that Darkie's uncle owned the kombi.  You have told the Committee that Damara Qunchu owned a kombi, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1722"><a name="pos1722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1723"><a name="pos1723"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In the judgement of the criminal court, at page 295 to 297, the Judge found that you had been in possession of an AK47.  That finding is correct not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The Judge also found that a meeting had been held, well he said that although he was of the opinion that the attack on Boipatong must have been planned, well planned in advance, he couldn't say that there was enough evidence to prove that there was this meeting two weeks before the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a>	We now know that there was such a meeting, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The Judge also said at page 3744, 296 of the bundle, page 3744 of the record, that you confirmed - I am not sure, I am trying to translate from the Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why don't you get somebody to do the translation, whilst you get on with the other questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I can understand Afrikaans, I am just trying not to be inaccurate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, then put the question to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1732"><a name="pos1732"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You confirmed in court that as part of the military attire, bands were worn around the head and you also corroborated that Moses Mthembu, accused 73, Moses Mthembu, was a leader to the extent that you couldn't decide on your own that the residents should go out on attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1733"><a name="pos1733"></a>	You required the approval of Moses Mthembu.  Do you remember saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1734"><a name="pos1734"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not remember that, but Moses Mthembu was indeed senior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1735"><a name="pos1735"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you required the approval of Moses Mthembu before you could take the residents out of the hostel that night, the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1736"><a name="pos1736"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was not easy to inform Mthembu about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1737"><a name="pos1737"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1738"><a name="pos1738"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> He was an elder and a senior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1739"><a name="pos1739"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you chose to bypass him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1740"><a name="pos1740"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1741"><a name="pos1741"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did you choose the 17th of June as the date for the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was a coincidence, there was no major reason why that date was chosen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1743"><a name="pos1743"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was it a coincidence that it came immediately after the June 16 commemoration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is so, it was just a coincidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was it also a coincidence that the ANC suspended their negotiations with the government as a result of the massacre in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am asking you was it a coincidence that it happened, because you are saying that was not the intended result that the ANC pulled out of the negotiations as a result of this massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was a coincidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I just have some isolated questions and then I will be done Mr Mkhize.  You don't know who rang the alarm that night, but it wasn't the person who usually rang the alarm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1750"><a name="pos1750"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember really who did ring the alarm, but the person who would normally blow the trumpet, was Manqeli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1751"><a name="pos1751"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You said in your evidence in chief at one point, that you did not give anyone an instruction to sound the alarm, then shortly thereafter you said that you did give someone an instruction to sound the alarm, what is the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1752"><a name="pos1752"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The person who was responsible for the trumpet was Manqeli.  I do not remember whether on this particular day, he was present or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1753"><a name="pos1753"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> My question was did you or did you not give someone an instruction to sound the alarm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1754"><a name="pos1754"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1755"><a name="pos1755"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you were firing with an AK47, you were not alone, there were other people firing with an AK47 and there were people firing shotguns and there were people firing pistols.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1756"><a name="pos1756"></a>	What did you do with the empty shells that would have been ejected from your guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1757"><a name="pos1757"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> There was nothing that we could do about those shells, we just left them on the ground, because it was dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1758"><a name="pos1758"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There was no mechanism employed to collect those shells or to make sure that they were not left behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1759"><a name="pos1759"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was at night and dark and there was no way you could have been able to pick them up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Have you any explanation for the fact that the police only recovered about eight, I might be incorrect with the number, but it was approximately eight, empty shells and all the other shells that must have been ejected from the AK47's, shotguns, 9 mm's, none of those shells were found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would not dispute that, but I do not know how that happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1762"><a name="pos1762"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the shells that were recovered, were destroyed by the police.  Do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1763"><a name="pos1763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1764"><a name="pos1764"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it correct that the police only came to the hostel the following day, did not close off or surround the hostel that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1765"><a name="pos1765"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not remember well, but I know that the police did arrive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1766"><a name="pos1766"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I think it was 16 hours after the attack that the police sealed off the hostel, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1767"><a name="pos1767"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would not dispute it.  What I remember is that the police came and they cordoned off the hostel and no one could get in or out of the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1768"><a name="pos1768"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, but that was only the following day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1769"><a name="pos1769"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1770"><a name="pos1770"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> After Mr Themba Khoza had arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1771"><a name="pos1771"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Even though I do not remember well, but I think it might have been after.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1772"><a name="pos1772"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the weapons which were taken by the police, were just put into a big pile in the hostel and taken away.  There was no attempt made to determine to whom each weapon belonged, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1773"><a name="pos1773"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I think they confiscated spears, not guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1774"><a name="pos1774"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did I understand you correctly, Mr Mkhize, when you said that the reason you feel sorry is because you are sorry that you didn't kill the members of the SDU's, and that you killed innocent people instead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1775"><a name="pos1775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1776"><a name="pos1776"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was Mr Themba Mabote armed with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1777"><a name="pos1777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Although I did not see him, I heard that he had a small firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1778"><a name="pos1778"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you not tell Mr Da Silva that you knew what gun Mr Mabote fired with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1779"><a name="pos1779"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1780"><a name="pos1780"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Mr Mkhize, I have no more questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1781"><a name="pos1781"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1782"><a name="pos1782"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson, I have no questions for the witness.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1799"><a name="pos1799"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DA SILVA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1800"><a name="pos1800"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.   Mr Lax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Mkhize, you indicated in your early part of your cross-examination when you were being questioned by Ms Tanzer, that you had received threats from some of the residents.  Do you remember saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Who gave you those threats, which residents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I already mentioned that those threats were from the residents of the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1805"><a name="pos1805"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I am asking you which residents threatened you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1806"><a name="pos1806"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say you feared that you could be attacked by the residents of kwaMadala, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1807"><a name="pos1807"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I mean that when they placed these complaints that they were being attacked and killed by people from Boipatong, they actually uttered that if I could not protect them, or if I could not take a decision about what to do, they would actually take the matter into their own hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1808"><a name="pos1808"></a>	Even though they did not give a direct threat, but that is what I thought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did any of the residents of the hostel directly threaten you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  But the residents in general were complaining that they were being killed and I was not taking any action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You said that you were elected to this position as head of the AmaButho, why didn't you just resign if you didn't want to go on with this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1812"><a name="pos1812"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It did occur to me, but I thought that would make no difference because the situation was such that it had already gone too far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you see, you have already told us that it wasn't IFP policy to do this sort of thing, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You also told us that Mtwana didn't want you to do this sort of thing, he wanted you to wait.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1817"><a name="pos1817"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You told us you didn't want this attack to happen yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1818"><a name="pos1818"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1819"><a name="pos1819"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So why did you have anything to do with it, why didn't you just resign and leave it?  You could have said let them do it if they want to do it, I don't want to be any part of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was because of the fear and confusion I felt at that time, because people were indeed dying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you were on the one hand, slightly in favour of this attack as well, is this what you are saying?  You said there was confusion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a>	Was the confusion in your own mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is what I mean.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Who gave the order to return back to the hostel once you had got to Slovo Park and you had assembled there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I gave that order and Mr Qunchu as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you met Qunchu at Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So his group and your group had obviously joined up by that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, we had joined up at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And then you jointly left the area back to kwaMadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1831"><a name="pos1831"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1832"><a name="pos1832"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And did you follow a different path on your way out of the township or did you follow the same path?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We took a different route.  We actually took a route that was actually towards the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Please explain what you mean by that, towards the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We were actually going up towards the hostel.  When we went to the township, we took an easterly route, but when we returned, we actually took a route in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The question was did you take a different route on your way back through the township, not a different direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was a different route.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Are you able to describe that route to us at all?  Do you remember any of the roads that you went through?  Did you come out at a different place, can you describe that place, that is what we are trying to understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not remember.  It was a road that actually went up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> When you came out of Boipatong, did you come out near the factories, near the firms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> On the inside of the township, but it was near the firms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> When you went in, you went in much more on the other side, closer towards what your lawyer referred to as the highway?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1843"><a name="pos1843"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Please repeat that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1844"><a name="pos1844"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> When you went in, you went in on the other side, much more of a westerly side, westerly part of the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1845"><a name="pos1845"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1846"><a name="pos1846"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1847"><a name="pos1847"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Adv Sigodi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1848"><a name="pos1848"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I have no questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1849"><a name="pos1849"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1850"><a name="pos1850"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.    Mr Mkhize, in your capacity as the Commander or leader of AmaButho, did you have power or authority to take such a decision to attack the residents, or were you supposed to get approval from any person above you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1851"><a name="pos1851"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  I did have the authority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1852"><a name="pos1852"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> After you converged at Slovo Park and you started moving back towards the hostel, were there any attacks on the residents of Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1853"><a name="pos1853"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did not hear, please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1854"><a name="pos1854"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You said you broke up into two groups and you met at Slovo Park, and then thereafter you started going back to the hostel.  My question is, were there any attacks on the residents inside Boipatong, not in Slovo Park, inside Boipatong when you were moving back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1855"><a name="pos1855"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, there were no further attacks on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1856"><a name="pos1856"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was Prince Vanana Zulu aware of the pressure which was mounting for the people to attack, was he aware that you were under pressure to make such a decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1857"><a name="pos1857"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I had informed him before, but he was not present on this particular day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1858"><a name="pos1858"></a>	He requested me to inform the people to hold on so that he could communicate with leaders from Boipatong.  On the day of the attack, the Prince was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1859"><a name="pos1859"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You said a decision to attack, was taken some time before the actual attack.  Was Mr Zulu aware that the attack was now going to take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1860"><a name="pos1860"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, he was not aware.  He was in fact not in favour of carrying out such an attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1861"><a name="pos1861"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So when he left to Natal, was the decision already taken or it was not yet taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1862"><a name="pos1862"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, it had been taken already.  But it had not been decided exactly when the date would be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a>	He was not aware that such a decision had been taken, because he did not approve of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1864"><a name="pos1864"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> We are aware that this attack took place at night, but is it possible for you to give a rough estimation of the number of the people who participated in this attack, a rough estimation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1865"><a name="pos1865"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It would not be easy to estimate the number, but there were many people who were there, because everyone who was in the hostel, actually went out on the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Lastly, you said you saw the caspir travelling on the road.  Was it at such a distance that the people in the caspir would easily identify you, easily see the group, your group of people coming from Boipatong?  Was it at such a distance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1867"><a name="pos1867"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was a bit far so it was possible that they could have seen us, or maybe they could have not, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1868"><a name="pos1868"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When you left, I am sorry Mr Chairperson, two more questions, when you left the hostel, where were the security which were supposed to be at the gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1869"><a name="pos1869"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> They were not at the gate, I did not see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1870"><a name="pos1870"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And when you returned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1871"><a name="pos1871"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, they were not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1872"><a name="pos1872"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1873"><a name="pos1873"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Lax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1874"><a name="pos1874"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you Chair, just one question that arose out of my colleague's question.  Did Vanana Zulu ever speak to you after the attack, on his return from kwaZulu and say to you what is going on, why did you do this thing, why did you just go ahead, you knew I didn't want this to happen?  Did he ever question you about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1875"><a name="pos1875"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, it was not possible for that to happen because the police arrested us and we did not get an opportunity to discuss that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1876"><a name="pos1876"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Even up until today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1877"><a name="pos1877"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Well, we did explain as we were seeking, or as we were preparing to seek amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1878"><a name="pos1878"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And what was his attitude?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1879"><a name="pos1879"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> He complained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1880"><a name="pos1880"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1881"><a name="pos1881"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In relation to the day when you went to attack Boipatong, when did the people in the hostel begin to complain about no action being taken against Boipatong residents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1882"><a name="pos1882"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> They had been complaining for quite a while, although I will not be able to specify exactly when.  As from the first time, the first day when people were killed, the people started complaining.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1883"><a name="pos1883"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the nature of their complaints?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1884"><a name="pos1884"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> They were complaining that they were being killed, they were being eliminated and no action was being taken by the leadership.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1885"><a name="pos1885"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To whom were these complaints addressed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1886"><a name="pos1886"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Although I do not know whether they did address these complaints to Prince Vanana, but in most instances, they were addressed to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1887"><a name="pos1887"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did the committee of which you are a member, ever discuss this complaints?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  They were never discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1889"><a name="pos1889"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1890"><a name="pos1890"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am not sure.  It could be because it had never been brought to their attention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1891"><a name="pos1891"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But did you not as a member of that committee, raise the matter with the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1892"><a name="pos1892"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not discuss it with them.  The only person I reported it to, was the Prince.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1893"><a name="pos1893"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you perhaps attempt to seek guidance from senior members of the IFP, apart from Mr Vanana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1894"><a name="pos1894"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I did not.  I did not inform anyone who was senior to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  As I understand your evidence, you said that as the leader of AmaButho, you had the authority to order the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1897"><a name="pos1897"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know why people would come to you with this complaint and not to the other members of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1898"><a name="pos1898"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.  They came to me because they knew that I was the leader of AmaButho.  I was the one who would actually take their complaints forward to the Prince.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1899"><a name="pos1899"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you get the feeling that they came to you because you had the authority to order the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1900"><a name="pos1900"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand the position, there were regular patrols around the hostel, kwaMadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The patrols were normally at the firm, not necessarily in the hostel where we resided.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the course of the patrols, did the police or the army, come to the hostel or at least to the gates of the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Sometimes they would come to the hostel and we will see them if they came during the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1905"><a name="pos1905"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The entrances to the hostel, how many were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> There is one main gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1907"><a name="pos1907"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And is this gate manned by security officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1908"><a name="pos1908"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Initially there was no security, but as time went on, there was somebody who was posted at the gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1909"><a name="pos1909"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was this individual posted at the gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1910"><a name="pos1910"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Although I cannot remember correctly, but I think it was after, subsequent to the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know any reason why there would have been a security at the gate only after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  As you prepared, you have been asked this question and I am going to repeat it, as you prepared to leave the hostel, armed in the manner in which you described, did it not occur to you that you might come across one of the police patrols before you reach Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It did not occur, but it did not occur at that particular point when we actually proceeded to Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1915"><a name="pos1915"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1916"><a name="pos1916"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know why, but I did not think of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1917"><a name="pos1917"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I take it because you were the Commander, and you would ordinarily be concerned about the safety of your men, were you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1918"><a name="pos1918"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What steps if any, did you then take to ensure that they would not be exposed to any arrest by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1920"><a name="pos1920"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did not take any steps.  What was on my mind, was that we were just going to go out and launch this attack.  No one questioned if we were ever going to meet police or if we were going to be arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1921"><a name="pos1921"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   Is it a fact that prior to the 17th of June, which is the day of the attack, or at least immediately before that day, it was generally known in the hostel, that there will be an attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1922"><a name="pos1922"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not think that is true, because no one had been informed about the decision.  We feared that if that information were to leak, it could even get to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1923"><a name="pos1923"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am not saying that it was known that the attack was going to take place on the 17th, but what was known was that there will be an attack at some point, at some future date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1924"><a name="pos1924"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1925"><a name="pos1925"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Was this announced at a public meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1926"><a name="pos1926"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1927"><a name="pos1927"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did you make that announcement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1929"><a name="pos1929"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may have been asked this question, but let me ask you again, do you know Andries Matanzima Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1930"><a name="pos1930"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1931"><a name="pos1931"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you ever heard the name Nosenga at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I have heard of the name Matanzima, although I have never seen the person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1933"><a name="pos1933"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you know about Matanzima?  What did you know about the name Matanzima?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1934"><a name="pos1934"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I heard that there was a certain Matanzima who had actually arrived at the hostel when we were arrested, and he said that he had been actually sent to go and kill people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1935"><a name="pos1935"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is Nosenga, but this was only after you had been arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1936"><a name="pos1936"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, after we had been arrested.  I do not know him at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1937"><a name="pos1937"></a>	I don't think he would be able to identify me, himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1938"><a name="pos1938"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  I just want to give you the opportunity to comment if you will, on the allegation that he made.  You see, he has made a sworn statement which is to the effect that there were police who escorted AmaButho into Boipatong.  Your evidence is that there were no police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1939"><a name="pos1939"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1940"><a name="pos1940"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you perhaps think of any reason why Nosenga will make this allegations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1941"><a name="pos1941"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> What he is saying, is not true.  It is not the truth at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1942"><a name="pos1942"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you think of any reason why he would make this allegation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1943"><a name="pos1943"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know.  The allegation that there were police accompanying people or who were transporting people, is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1944"><a name="pos1944"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we have been furnished with a memorandum  which was submitted on behalf of the victims, one of the allegations which they make, is that white men were seen amongst the attackers in Boipatong.  Did you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1945"><a name="pos1945"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I understand you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1946"><a name="pos1946"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you say to these allegations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1947"><a name="pos1947"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> What I can say is that it is not true.  As I mentioned before, I did not understand why when seeking amnesty, I would hide or fear to divulge information on who was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1948"><a name="pos1948"></a>	I would actually give all that information, if the police were present, I would say they were part of that attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1949"><a name="pos1949"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Is there a possibility that because of the large numbers of persons who were in Boipatong to attack, and the size of Boipatong, there were police but you didn't see them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1950"><a name="pos1950"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would dispute that, because there was no car, no vehicle that was seen in that vicinity at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1951"><a name="pos1951"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Very well, thank you Mr Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1952"><a name="pos1952"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, might I ask two questions flowing from questions from the Chair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1953"><a name="pos1953"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1954"><a name="pos1954"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> Thank you.  Mr Mkhize, how many days before the attack on Boipatong, did you make the public announcement that there was to be an attack on Boipatong, without giving the date?  How many days before the actual attack, did you make that public announcement that Boipatong was going to be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1955"><a name="pos1955"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I mentioned before that I have forgotten what time lapsed before the actual date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1956"><a name="pos1956"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Approximately how many days?  Three days, a week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1957"><a name="pos1957"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It could have been a week or more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1958"><a name="pos1958"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You have told the Committee that your immediate superior, Vanana Zulu, specifically told you not to launch an attack on Boipatong, and yet you say that you had authority to launch the attack on Boipatong.  From where or from whom did you get that authority?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1959"><a name="pos1959"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did say that I had the authority because the Prince was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1960"><a name="pos1960"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, the Prince had told you that when he is not there, you are not to launch an attack on Boipatong, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1961"><a name="pos1961"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The Prince said we should wait.  He did not specifically tell us not to launch an attack in his absence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1962"><a name="pos1962"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He said you should wait before you launched an attack, wait for him to come back.  My question remains from whom or from where do you say you had authority to launch an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1963"><a name="pos1963"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> What I am saying to you is that the Prince was absent, he had gone home and therefore I had that authority to launch an attack.  He did not issue an instruction that we should not attack in his absence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1964"><a name="pos1964"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> According to you, Mtwana Zulu said that you should allow him to speak to the residents of Boipatong, that there should not be an attack, that was your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1965"><a name="pos1965"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1966"><a name="pos1966"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So who gave you the authority to launch that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1967"><a name="pos1967"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No one.  I took it upon myself, because people were dying continuously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1968"><a name="pos1968"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1969"><a name="pos1969"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1970"><a name="pos1970"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mkhize, you may step down.  Before you return to your seat, because would be rising shortly, there are a couple of matters that we have to deal with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1971"><a name="pos1971"></a>	Firstly Mlupeki Tshabangu and Sipho Buthelezi, you were not present at these hearings when we resumed yesterday, is that right?  Would you please come forward and speak next to the microphone.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1973"><a name="pos1973"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I am Sipho Buthelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1974"><a name="pos1974"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were not present yesterday when the matter resumed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1975"><a name="pos1975"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1976"><a name="pos1976"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1977"><a name="pos1977"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I was actually waiting for the people who normally transport us to the venue, to pick me up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1978"><a name="pos1978"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the only reason?  Do you understand English or do you want me to speak in Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1979"><a name="pos1979"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I was prevented from arriving here yesterday by the fact that I was waiting for the people who normally pick us up and they did not arrive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1980"><a name="pos1980"></a>	One other reason is that I did not have money so that I could travel on my own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1981"><a name="pos1981"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was supposed to bring you here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1982"><a name="pos1982"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> I am referring to the two white persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1983"><a name="pos1983"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you in custody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1984"><a name="pos1984"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUTHELEZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1985"><a name="pos1985"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Tshabangu, you were not here when we resumed yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1986"><a name="pos1986"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABANGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1987"><a name="pos1987"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1988"><a name="pos1988"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABANGU:</span> There was a communication problem.  On the last day of the previous sitting, I had requested at the previous hearing that I should be contacted by the people who are my co-applicants and I could not contact them telephonically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1989"><a name="pos1989"></a>	On Monday morning I assumed that the people who normally pick us up, would come for me, but they did not arrive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1990"><a name="pos1990"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, you are the applicant, both of you are the applicants in this matter.  You have the obligation to ensure that you are here so that your application can be heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1991"><a name="pos1991"></a>	I know that we have heard your evidence, but we haven't heard the evidence of Buthelezi.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1992"><a name="pos1992"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABANGU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1993"><a name="pos1993"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think in future, this will not be tolerated.  You must make sure that you are here in time.  If there are any problems, notify your Attorneys that you have a problem, so that there are no delays.  I am not suggesting that we did not proceed yesterday because you were not there, but it may well occur in future that your absence may lead to a delay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1994"><a name="pos1994"></a>	It is in your interest to be here always, because the evidence that may be given here, may effect you one way or the other, and you've got to hear that evidence and give instructions to your Attorney so that that evidence if necessary, can be disputed.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1995"><a name="pos1995"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABANGU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1996"><a name="pos1996"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I cannot pronounce your name, how do you pronounce your name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1997"><a name="pos1997"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHELLBERG:</span> Shellberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1998"><a name="pos1998"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Shellberg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1999"><a name="pos1999"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHELLBERG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2000"><a name="pos2000"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shellberg, in regard to Mr Nosenga, you have now had the opportunity to interview him in the presence of his legal representative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2001"><a name="pos2001"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHELLBERG:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.  I have interviewed Mr Nosenga, together with Ms Tanzer</p>
<p class="line" id="line2002"><a name="pos2002"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am sorry, you may return to your seat gentlemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2003"><a name="pos2003"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHELLBERG:</span> Based on the information that I obtained, I have recommended that the Witness Protection Unit that has already been in place since this morning, should be stepped up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2004"><a name="pos2004"></a>	I have also been in contact with the prison authorities to change, or to step up the security concerning Mr Nosenga in the prison, and I also had discussions with the police present at this location, also to make sure that the protection is as good as it can be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2005"><a name="pos2005"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you discussed these matters with Mr Nosenga and his legal representative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2006"><a name="pos2006"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHELLBERG:</span> Yes, we have discussed this together and Mr Nosenga is satisfied with these arrangements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2007"><a name="pos2007"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.  Do you confirm that Ma'am?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2008"><a name="pos2008"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I do Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2009"><a name="pos2009"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.  Thank you Mr Shellberg.  We will leave the matter in your hands then, to make sure that he is afforded the necessary protection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2010"><a name="pos2010"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHELLBERG:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2011"><a name="pos2011"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, if I ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2012"><a name="pos2012"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the issue of protection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2013"><a name="pos2013"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, I thought that issue was dealt with, I've got another issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2014"><a name="pos2014"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no.  I think for the record, Mr Shellberg, would you convey to the responsible Head of the Prison, where these threats are supposed to emanate from, that these threats have been made, we are told, that there have been threats made against Mr Nosenga and if he could please to investigate these allegations and then report back to you and then you can give us a report in due course because I consider it to be a fairly serious matter, if a witness is threatened in any manner whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2015"><a name="pos2015"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHELLBERG:</span> Yes, I will do so Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2016"><a name="pos2016"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2017"><a name="pos2017"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson, I would like to get a directive from the Committee with regard to applicants that have already testified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2018"><a name="pos2018"></a>	Are they under obligation to remain present, I would assume that it would be in their interest to remain present to give instructions if there are certain things said against them, but I would just like to get a directive as to the legal situation, if they are - if they have to be here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2019"><a name="pos2019"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, it would seem to be prima facie that to the extent that a decision has been made, that their applications would be heard together, and they have to remain here until the applications have been finalised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2020"><a name="pos2020"></a>	Having said that, however, it may well be necessary that the applicant may wish to be excused for whatever reason.  It is a matter which we would have to consider as and when it arises.  But I would have thought that it would be in the interest of each and every applicant to be present throughout the proceedings, so that they can hear for themselves what evidence is being given and if there is any evidence that is given, which is prejudicial to them, they should be in a position to give instructions to their legal representative, a matter which they can't do if they are not here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2021"><a name="pos2021"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes Chairperson, I am faced with such a situation because one of the applicants, Mr Tshabangu, must attend certain lectures, he is busy studying some course and he told me that he must attend certain lectures tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2022"><a name="pos2022"></a>	That is the reason why I asked for this directive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2023"><a name="pos2023"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, the Committee has no objections to him being excused, as long as there is someone here who is going to look after his interest.  If his legal representative is here, we don't have a problem with that, so he may be excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2024"><a name="pos2024"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2025"><a name="pos2025"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Another matter which I want to raise, and this is directed to you Mr Shellberg and Mr Mapoma.  The affidavit of Mr Nosenga which was handed in this morning, directly implicates the police in the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2026"><a name="pos2026"></a>	It seems to me that the police must therefore be given the necessary notice under the Act.  Would you make sure that that notice is sent out to the police as soon as it is practicable to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2027"><a name="pos2027"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes Chairperson, I will do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2028"><a name="pos2028"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there any matter that Counsel wishes to raise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2029"><a name="pos2029"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairperson, there is one aspect that perturbs me.  You referred in the cross-examination of the previous witness, previous applicant, to this document.  It is a document that exceeds 80 pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2030"><a name="pos2030"></a>	I don't know from whom it was meant to have been handed in, I don't know if it is before the Committee, I don't know what its evidential value is, and I don't know what the purpose of it is, with respect Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2031"><a name="pos2031"></a>	A further aspect Mr Chairperson, that perturbs me is why so late in the day, on the second day of the hearing, at three o'clock, this document which is an extensive document, is made available to Counsel?  Counsel - it is required of us to study the document, possibly consult with witnesses in regard to the allegations that are made here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2032"><a name="pos2032"></a>	I personally feel, this is my personal view, that it is unfair towards Counsel to be given a document of this nature, at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2033"><a name="pos2033"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Throughout these proceedings Mr Da Silva, we have been receiving documents, not at a time when those documents should have been received, but fairly late, and that is the circumstance you have to live with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2034"><a name="pos2034"></a>	You must just do your best as all of us have been doing in the past, go through this document tonight, consult if necessary and make sure that you are ready tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2035"><a name="pos2035"></a>	As I understand this document, it is prepared by - it has been put together by the Investigative Unit of the TRC, is that right?  Yes, it has been compiled by the Investigating Unit of the TRC, it is intended to assist whoever who needs assistance from these documents, to go through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2036"><a name="pos2036"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I am indebted to your explanation Mr Chairman.  The only, if I can put it this way, the objection that I have is that a document is made available and with due respect, and it is not that I am pointing fingers at anybody, that is not my intention, but as far as I am concerned, I was the only person sitting here during the tea adjournment, and there is no explanation whatsoever given, from where the document comes from, with respect Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2037"><a name="pos2037"></a>	I will leave the matter there, I understand that we are dealing with this matter in exceptional circumstances.  I just thought that I would raise this concern because it is a real concern that I have in the matter, and it is not an intention, and I say this with the utmost respect, of pointing fingers at anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2038"><a name="pos2038"></a>	It is just that I felt that it is unfair that such a document, of this nature, is made available at such a late stage.  But I accept what you have said Mr Chairman, and I don't think it is necessary to take it any further than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2039"><a name="pos2039"></a>	I am indebted to you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2040"><a name="pos2040"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, just to satisfy Mr Da Silva, do you know why this document was given to him this late?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2041"><a name="pos2041"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, this document was prepared by the Investigative Unit together with my predecessor, Adv Prior and he made a suggestion that this document be made available to all the legal representatives and the Committee members, for whatever assistance that they may need through it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2042"><a name="pos2042"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I am indebted to the explanation Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2043"><a name="pos2043"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you are perfectly entitled to challenge the contents of this document, and on a perusal, it would appear that it includes documents such as the report of the inquiry into the police's response to the events in Boipatong, this is the Goldstone Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2044"><a name="pos2044"></a>	I think one should accept that a decision has been made to make this document available, and it is just before us.  We will have to do our best to go through the document and if necessary, Counsel will be given time to consult with his or her client if necessary.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2045"><a name="pos2045"></a>	Again to the extent that the issues that Counsel intends to raise, are relevant to the issues before us,  should we give it a number at this stage?  Perhaps we should give it a number.  It would be marked as Exhibit S.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2046"><a name="pos2046"></a>	Very well.  Mr Berger, did you have anything to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2047"><a name="pos2047"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No Chairperson, it is not necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2048"><a name="pos2048"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I have something to say whilst we are talking about documents, I know it is late in the day, but I just want to make sure that we don't end up with the same situation that documents aren't received, or received at a late stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2049"><a name="pos2049"></a>	At a previous hearing, there were certain documents outstanding for Mr Mxoliseni Mkhize and Paulos Mbatha.  Those documents I handed over to the Committee, but I see it has not been added to the bundle.  That is just the affidavit of these people and further particulars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2050"><a name="pos2050"></a>	I just want to make sure that all the relevant parties have copies of this document, otherwise I will have to make further copies and have it available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2051"><a name="pos2051"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> None of the Committee members as far as I am aware, are in possession of those documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2052"><a name="pos2052"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We were given documents for Mbatha and Mkhize, if that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2053"><a name="pos2053"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I will just make then sure that further copies are made and made available as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2054"><a name="pos2054"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will reconvene tomorrow morning at half past eight.</p>
