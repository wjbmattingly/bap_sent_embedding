<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>	Yes, Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, just before I start, in the bundle you would only find two pages relating to this applicant and that is page 209 and 210.  That is a request for further particulars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>	At the beginning of this session a bundle of documents in relation to this applicant was handed to the Committee and all other parties, which includes a Form 1, the annexure, his reply to the further particulars and an affidavit by the applicant.  I suggest, Chairperson, that we mark the documents 210(a) to 210(i).</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom, I'm still struggling to get hold of those documents.  I know that they were furnished to us - oh, I beg your pardon, yes very well, I do have those documents now.  That consist of Form 1 ...(intervention)</p>

<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, Chairperson, my suggestion is that we mark Form 1: 210(a) (b) and (c).</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any objection to that course?  So Form 1 will be marked - did you say ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> 210(a) (b) and (c), and the annexure to that Form 1, 210(d) and (e).</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right.</p>

<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, since the beginning I've instructed the other applicants to try and get hold of him and to warn him to be here.  At this stage there is still no sign.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Yes, very well, proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>	Mr Mbatha, I want you to have a look at the so-called Form 1, I'm going to show you your signature on page 210(c).  Do you confirm your signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And do also confirm the contents of this document as it has been translated to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In paragraph 9.4 you stated</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>"I had a spear.  I was part of Chonco's group.  I stabbed two people.  The one person died, the other one ran away."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>Do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In paragraph 11(b) you stated</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>"I heard for the first time of the attack on the 17th of June 1992, at the stadium.  Chonco said that we should attack Boipatong because we had enough of the people from Boipatong."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now there's also an annexure to this Form 1, which is actually a reply to some of the questions in this document.  Do you agree with the contents of the answers as they've been translated to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you agree with the political objective for the attack as set out in this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Is that the reason why you were part of the attackers on the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Then certain questions were asked and answers were provided.  These answers as they have been shown to you, are those the answers to the questions on page 209 and 210?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And just for the record, your reply appears on page 210(f) and (g).  Then you made an affidavit on page 210(h) to 210(i), do you confirm your signature on the last page, 210(i)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And do you also confirm the contents of this document, the affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In Boipatong itself on the night of the attack, can you just describe your role and what you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I went to work on the 17th of June, that was in the morning and I came back late in the evening and I found people coming out of the arena saying that they were going to Serele and I said: "Thank you for a long time I have been wishing that such a thing could happen, not knowing what to do seeing that I didn't have the power."</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why did you say thank you, why did you want to go to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I was very angry in those days as a result of the Boipatong problem, the death of people day in and day out.  My brother was killed there as well.  Those were the reasons that bothered me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Apart from Boipatong, were you cross with the residents of other townships in the Vaal Triangle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> They too, we couldn't walk freely around the townships that were a distance from the hostel but because Boipatong was closer, killing us from just a distance, that is why I got so angry, overly angry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And why did you want to attack the residents of Boipatong, or let me ask you this, who in Boipatong did you want to attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I wanted the so-called defence.  I didn't know this defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know who are the people who supported the defence, as you call them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was the community of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were you cross with the community of Boipatong as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, but I very much wanted the actual people who were killing people in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now just to move a step back, at the stadium before you went to Boipatong, tell me who gave the order and what was the order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not get that but I later on discovered that it was Damarra.  You see, I couldn't go to the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I had just arrived from work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During that period did you work a normal day shift or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, it was a day shift.  I was working during the day only, not in the evenings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Where did you work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I working at the Sam Jam(?) contract.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Whilst you were in Boipatong, did you see any police or military vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, not whilst we were inside Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see any military vehicles or police vehicles at a later stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> There is one vehicle that I saw coming from the Vanderbijl Park direction, moving towards Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When did you see that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> At the time shortly after we exited from the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now in Boipatong itself you say that you stabbed two people, the one died and the other ran away, can you just give particulars of these instances, starting with the instance where you killed somebody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The situation resulted from circumstances in which I found myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, just give more particulars about what you did in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> My participation pertained to the killing of people or the dying of people at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mbatha, we understand from the affidavit that is before us that you stabbed a person who died and that the other person that you stabbed ran away, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What your counsel wants you to do is to tell us in your own words what you did in Boipatong, do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.  I went into a house, broke a window to gain entry seeing that the doors were locked.  I found a girl who was trying to jump out of the window, I apprehended her and I asked her where the other comrades were and she said she didn't know.  I stabbed that instant and she fell.  I opened the wardrobe ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where did you stab her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I stabbed her here.  I then opened the wardrobe ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just indicate again where you stabbed her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I stabbed her here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, you are indicating just below the right ear in the vicinity of the collarbone, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, but then I pointed or directed my spear downwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know how old this girl you referred to was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would not say but she could have been my age.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> How old are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I am 35 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why did you stab her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We were frustrated by the fact that we could not locate the people we were looking for.  I was therefore infuriated because these are the people who get so excited when we get killed, they are the ones who are always found in the forefront.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When you asked her where the comrades are, did she say anything in reply?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> She said she didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After you stabbed her what happened to her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> She died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know where in Boipatong this incident took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I am not quite familiar with the area, I was there for the first time that evening.  I do not even know the streets, but there is one shop that is near the taxi rank and that is the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was that shortly after you had entered Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did I understand you correctly, did this happen inside her house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After that, did you leave the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I opened the wardrobe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I found two males in the wardrobe hidden there.  I then called upon Themba ...(end of tape) ... because they had trapped the doors to the wardrobe so that we could not open and they were shot from inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who shot them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Themba Mabote.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know if they died or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> They died because they collapsed and we could see their heads outside the wardrobe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did anything further happen in that specific house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, we then left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now you also said that you stabbed another person but this person ran away, can you tell the Committee about this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Just go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I found this person in this one particular house.  When we left that house just about to enter another house I saw him coming out trying to escape.  There was a Peugeot vehicle and he tried to conceal himself behind the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>	I noticed and I approached during which time he fled.  I chased him and he jumped over a fence and I stabbed him as he was jumping the fence.  He landed on the other side and he continued running.  I don't know what became of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> This person, was it an elderly person, or can you just give an indication of the age of this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was a person older than myself.  Even though it was at night I think he could have been older than myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Tell me generally, what was the situation with light in Boipatong, was it dark or could you see what you were doing, what was the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Apart from the two instances you've referred now, were you personally involved in any other instances where people got killed or injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would say yes, even though I was not directly involved.  I was doing that myself even though not directly killing someone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What do you mean, did you see other people doing things or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We went into a house which was empty.  We searched inside and I found these people under a bed and I removed them.  It was a male as well as a female.  I pulled them out and Themba shot them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> That's it.</p>

<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And this last instance where you chased people which Themba shot, can you give any indication where in Boipatong this happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I am not in the position because I was just walking around not being able to tell in which area we were.</p>

<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After the attack did you go to the stadium or directly to your room?</p>

<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>	The vehicle that you saw, the military vehicle, do  you know the streets that surround Boipatong, do you know Frikkie Meyer Boulevard and Nobel Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I cannot differentiate between the two streets.  There is one that comes from Vanderbijl Park and the other one that leads towards the firms.</p>

<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was the kind of vehicle wherein you can see somebody or somebody's head peeping from inside.  I don't know what kind of a vehicle it is, I don't know it's name really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Can you say whether it was a military vehicle or any other vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I saw it and concluded that it must be a military vehicle.</p>

<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> At what time did you see this vehicle, can you estimate?</p>
