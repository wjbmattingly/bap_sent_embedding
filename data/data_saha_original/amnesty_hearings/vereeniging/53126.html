<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> The process of amnesty, I did not have any idea as far as this is concerned, but I heard when Buthelezi and Mthembu were being questioned.  I did not have any idea.  I only got the idea when I was listening as they were questioned.  I came here to clear my name in front of the people of Boipatong and to mention that I was falsely implicated.  I was convicted, falsely convicted by the Judge.  I knew very well that my hands are clean.  I know nothing about the Boipatong incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Could you speak slowly so that we can get the interpretation clearly because if you speak fast we can't get it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You were asked if you want to withdraw your application, you said no, you want to carry on with the application, why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> My reasons are as follows:  I am prepared to tell the people of Boipatong that I am innocent, I know nothing about the attack.  That is the reason why I came here, because I know this place as a place to tell the truth.  I wanted to come here and tell the people that I know nothing about the Boipatong incident.  I as sick on that particular day, I had flu.  I was not feeling well, and that is why I had to go to bed as early as 8 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I've got no further questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So you don't know whether he was staying at the hostel or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> I won't even mention anything about him.  I don't even know what to say about him because I don't even know him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, just one question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I beg your pardon, do you want Mr Berger to start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> I would be ...(indistinct) to say it that way, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>	Mr Mdiniso, if I understand you correctly, you did not attend any meeting prior to the 17th of June 1992 at which there was talk about an attack, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> Yes, that is correct.  The only meeting that I attended is only one where there was a complaint when a car was burnt down.  A gentleman by the name of ...(indistinct) Sibiya and the other one whose surname was Zulu, they were together.  Their car was burnt down at Sondela.  I heard the complaints from the people and previously people had died and people were complaining because they were dying.  That was the only meeting that I attended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The only question is, at no meeting at which you attended was there ever any talk about an attack on anyone, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I just want to ask you one question or I want to concentrate just on one sentence in your affidavit at page 201 where you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>"I know many people in Boipatong."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>At the time of the attack, did you know many people in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> Do you mean during the attack?  Will you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm not suggesting that you were part of the attack, I'm saying, at that time, June 1992, did you know many people in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> No, I would request you not to refer to me about the time of the attack.  What I said is that I knew people from Boipatong prior to the attack.  Just before the politics I grew up in that place and I knew quite a number of people.  Please don't refer me to the attack because I was not present but I know the people from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mdiniso, please listen to my question.  You say in your affidavit, which was signed by you in 1998, June 1998, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>"I know many people in Boipatong."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>Is that correct? </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> The people who are residing at Boipatong, I know the residents, the real residents of Boipatong, not people from KwaZulu Natal.  I was also a tenant at Boipatong.  I did not own a house there, I was just a tenant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And these people that you know who are living in Boipatong, they were also living in Boipatong at the time of the attack, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> You mean during the attack?  There was a meeting at Zone 7 on the 22nd.  I'm not sure whether the month was July because that place is far away.  On our way from that meeting, when we went to the hostel at Sebokeng, the hostel was closed.  They told us the Zulus were not welcome.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>	The following day on the 23rd, there were pamphlets that were distributed all over the place, in the houses in the townships.  The pamphlets were saying that the Zulus were not welcome.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mdiniso, please, you're going on a long story.  You're being asked a very simple question.  it's really a simple matter.  Mr Berger is asking you that as at June 1992, is it correct that you knew many people who were involved or were living in Boipatong, simple as that, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> Yes, I knew people there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Mr Mdiniso, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR STRYDOM:</span> Just one question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>	During 1992, you were working at Iscor, is that correct?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And you worked shifts, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> Yes, I was working three shifts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And some people that worked at Iscor lived in Boipatong, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> The people who were working for Iscor, among them there were people who were residing at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No further questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mdiniso, you do understand that this Committee only has the power to grant amnesty to persons who have committed an offence with a political motive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> Yes, that is what I got to understand when I arrived here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As we understand your evidence you never committed any act of violence in relation to the Boipatong massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The only reason you came to this Committee was to tell the people of Boipatong that you are innocent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDINISO:</span> Yes, that is the reason, because in Court I was found guilty.  I wanted to apply for amnesty and to clear my name.  Among my brothers and the people of Boipatong they should know that I'm innocent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was done by the High Court cannot be undone by this Committee.  If you persist in your innocence, only the Appeal Court has the power to undo what was done by the High Court.  Do you understand that?</p>
