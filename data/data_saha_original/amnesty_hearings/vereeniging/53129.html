<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">PAULOS MCIKELENI MBATHA:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mbatha, what is your standard of education?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Standard four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you presently in custody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you released on bail when your co-accused in the criminal trial were released on bail, and have you been out of jail ever since?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When were you released on bail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I cannot remember the date, but I think it was in 1995.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And since then, where have you been living?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I went to stay at Khayelitsha, and I went back home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that Khayelitsha Hostel in Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did you go home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I stayed there for only a week and I went back home thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You stayed at the hostel for a week, and then you went back home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that's to Nongoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when did you return to the Khayelitsha Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I cannot remember very well, but I stayed home for quite a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you back in the Khayelitsha Hostel in 1997?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you've been staying in the Khayelitsha Hostel from 1997 until now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you leave from time to time to go home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, sometimes I go home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did you decide to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I took that decision last year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When, can you be more specific?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I cannot remember the date, but it was just after I was discharged from hospital, round, just around the Easter holidays.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So would I be correct to say that the first time that you decided to apply for amnesty was Easter 1997?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well when was the first time you decided to apply for amnesty?    I beg your pardon, Easter 1998?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was (indistinct) 1998, during the Easter holidays I was home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, my question is, when did you first decide that you were going to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was in 1998, I cannot remember whether it was August or September, it was when I had just arrived from home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If you have a look at your application, which starts at page 210A, have a look at page 210C and you'll see there a date, the 7th of August 1998, would that be the time when you first decided to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I can say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Before that you had not given anyone an instruction that you wished to apply for amnesty, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I did not tell or instruct anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, you told the committee yesterday that when you heard that there was going to be an attack on Boipatong, you said, "Thank you, because I've been waiting for this", remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And yet you tell the committee that the first time that you ever heard about any talk about an attack was on the 17th of June 1992, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never attended a single meeting, prior to the 17th of June, at which there was talk of a possible attack, not on Boipatong, but of a possible attack, you didn't attend any such meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Will you please repeat your question, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Prior to the 17th of June, you never attended a single meeting where there was talk of an attack, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's not right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I never attended such meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Not only that, but you never heard from anyone else that there had been such meetings, am I right?   You say no, but... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I never heard anything to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How is that possible, because we know that there were meetings prior to the 17th at which there was talk of an attack, and if you were so keen to attack, how is it possible that you never had a single conversation with anybody discussing a possible attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> My problem is this, I was always at work, I was only there at Kwamadala Hostel on a Monday, the date was the 15th and the following day was going to be the 16th, which was going to be a holiday, that is why I had to come back from work.   During the mampara week, I wouldn't come to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What's the mampara week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It is the week where you work Saturday and Sunday without a pay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did you sleep at your place of employment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And where was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was at Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How often would you sleep in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would sleep there sometimes if I was off during weekends, I would go to the hostel and spend a weekend there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that's how it was throughout 1991 and the first half of 1992, that you would spend weekends at the hostel, if it wasn't the mampara week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> During those weekends, you never had a discussion with anybody during which you were told that there was talk of a possible attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If you were at work on Wednesday, the 17th of June 1992, why did you not sleep there that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> On the 17th of June, I was at Kwamadala Hostel.  I arrived on a Monday, because I was off on a Tuesday, and I woke up early on the Wednesday, I went to work, I came back in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well that's my question, Mr Mbatha, if you went to work on Wednesday, the 17th of June, why did you not sleep there as you normally did on a Wednesday night, because you were going to go to work again on the Thursday, the 18th of June, why was it necessary for you to come back to the hostel that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was not easy to get public transport, taxis, during the weekends, it was better during the week, but it was very difficult for us to get public transport on weekends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I think what counsel is asking you is this, you've told us that you normally slept at your place of employment, and during the week of the 17th you returned to the hostel on Monday because you were not working on Tuesday, and that on Wednesday you were working, but you returned to the hostel after work.   You were working on Thursday and you were working on Friday.   Now what counsel wants to find out is, because you normally spent, if you normally slept at your place of employment, given the fact that you were working on Wednesday and you were going to go to work on Thursday and on Friday, why was it necessary for you to come back to the hostel on Wednesday, why didn't you sleep at your place of employment, as you normally do?    Do you understand the question?   Is that what you want to put, Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> You mean the reason that made me to come to the hostel on Wednesday or Thursday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me see what I can explain to you in Zulu.  You told this committee, you have told the committee that you would work and sleep at work, stay over at your workplace on this week - no, no, no, not at your workplace, Ms Interpreter, during the week of the 15th, you went back to the hostel on a Monday.   You did that because you were not going to work on the Tuesday, but you were going to work on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday.   Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What the counsellor wants to know is this, as you used to sleep at your workplace during your working days, what made you to decide to go back to the hostel on Wednesday instead of staying over at your workplace?   Do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was just a coincidence, because I came back on Thursday also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, Mr... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Sorry, can I just get some clarification on this point?   You said, did I get you correctly when you said that you would sleep at work when it is a mampara week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And your definition of a mampara week is the week when you would not be paid but you would work even on Saturday and on Sunday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that was the previous week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> So were you paid fortnightly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And then on the week that you would be paid, where would you sleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would come back and sleep at Kwamadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> In other words, the weekend preceding - when you wouldn't be paid, you would sleep at work and then the following week when you would be paid, then you'd sleep at the hostel, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, sometimes I would come back to the hostel if there was a need for me to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Would you come back during the week or would you come back during the weekend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would come back even if it's during the week, but I used to come back mostly on weekends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mbatha, I thought I understood from you that you spent most of your time at work and sleeping at work, and occasionally you would spend weekends at the hostel, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I would be present during some weekends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's just see whether we can get clarity on this.   Did you always sleep at your place of employment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How often would you return to the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would come back after knocking off on a Friday, if it's still early I would go to the hostel and leave on a Monday.    Sometimes I would just come or sometimes I wouldn't, I would stay over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is the position that you would return to the hostel during the week at times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, if I happened to knock off early, I would go to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and sometimes you would only go to the hostel over the weekend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know whether that clarifies, madam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mbatha, do I then understand you correctly to say that you actually spent more time at the hostel than just the occasional weekend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Not most of the times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I didn't get that translation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I used to go to the hostel and stay there, but most of the times I would be at my workplace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And in order for you to get to the hostel, am I correct that you would have to take public transport from Vereeniging to Kwamadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How did you get to the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would take a taxi to Terela, and I would alight at the robots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you would have to pay for that taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, the transport is not free, public transport is not for free.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So unless you had a need to return to the hostel during the week, it was cheaper for you to sleep at work during the week and only return to the hostel on weekends, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that used to help me also, but most of the time I would stay over because of knocking off very late.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And so the reason you went to the hostel on Wednesday, the 17th of June, was because there was a need, am I right, it wasn't just a pure coincidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I said it was a coincidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the need, I put it to you, was because you knew that there was going to be an attack on Boipatong that night, that's why you didn't sleep at work, that's why you returned to the hostel that afternoon, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> If I knew that, Mr Berger, I wouldn't hid that now, I wouldn't mention all the people that I injured there during that incident and decide to hide this simple information or minor information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's not so minor, because then we would go in to all the meetings that were held before the attack, wouldn't we?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I regarded it as a minor thing, because no-one would die in such meetings, there were no murders or deaths.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the stadium, on the 17th of June - well let me ask you this, when the alarm went off, you went to the stadium, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not hear the siren, I didn't even go to the stadium, I was not yet there at the hostel at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well let me read to you what you say in your affidavit at page 210(I), the second paragraph on that page, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>"On the evening of the 17th of June 1992, the alarm went off and all of us went to the stadium."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>Is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you confirmed this yesterday, Mr Mbatha, as being true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, all I said was this, when I arrived, the people were from the stadium.   I inquired as to what was happening and they said it was time go and attack, that is when I said, I mentioned that (Indistinct)... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mbatha, we understand what your evidence is often concerning your role on the day in question.  I think what's being put to you is that at the commencement of your evidence in chief, you were asked to confirm the contents of certain documents which were made available to you.   One of those documents contains the statement that counsel has just put to you, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I do understand that, but this issue about the stadium is confusing me, I did not go to the stadium on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we understand that.   I think what you're being asked is the simple question as to, if you didn't go to the stadium, why then did you tell us that the contents of the statement that was read to you were accurate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would like to apologise for that, that was a mistake from my side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You go on in your statement, the next sentence, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>"There..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>meaning at the stadium:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>"...Quonquo said that we must attack Boipatong."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>Now, leave aside the point that what you're referring to is what was said at the stadium, was it reported to you that Quonquo had said that you must attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I was told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were told that Quonquo had told the people at the stadium that they must attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And is it correct that you were told that Quonquo said, "We must attack Boipatong because we have had enough with the people of Boipatong"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now that's all the people living in Boipatong, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I can say so, because it was mentioned, they mentioned all the people of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And so the attack was an attack on all the people of Boipatong, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, but it was also mentioned that the people that were most wanted were the defence people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why is there not a mention in your statement at 210(H) to (I), not a word about the self defence units, why is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I'm the one who did not mention that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We understand that.   I think the question is, why didn't you mention that in your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I do not have a reason, I do not have a reason for omitting that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The reason that you omitted it is because it was said at the stadium that "We are going to destroy Boipatong", and there were no fine distinctions drawn between the self defence units and the people of Boipatong, everybody knew at the stadium that there was now an attack to be launched, and everyone and everything in Boipatong was to be destroyed, that's the reason it's not in your statement, Mr Mbatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> That is not true, I did not hear that instruction as to how to kill the people or who to kill at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do I understand you correctly that you would have attacked the other townships like Sebokeng or Sharpeville, but Boipatong was chosen because it was the closest to Kwamadala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If there had been police in Boipatong during the attack, and police vehicles in Boipatong during the attack, are you saying you would have seen it, you would have seen them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And your evidence is that there was not a single police vehicle in Boipatong at the time of the attack, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Not only would you have seen it, but even if you had not seen it, you would have heard about it from your co-attackers, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would have seen them in they were in there at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And since the attack on Boipatong until today, you have never had a discussion with anybody, or heard anyone talk about the presence of the police in Boipatong during the attack, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you did see a military vehicle as you were leaving Boipatong, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that was when you were in the veld between Boipatong and the main road, the road that separates Boipatong from Kwamadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not see it at the road, I only saw it on our way out from the township, we were at the veld and this vehicle was headed towards Sebokeng, it made a turn at the filling station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If you're standing in the veld looking towards Kwamadala, are you saying that that military vehicle drove on the road in front of you, coming from your left, moving past you and going to your right towards Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was a distance after we had left the township, we saw this vehicle approaching, making a U turn at the filling station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But am I correct, do I understand your evidence correctly that this military vehicle passed in front of you, quite a distance in front of you, but passed in front of you, from your left moving to your right and towards Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And after it had gone past you and got towards the robot, that was when it did a U turn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And once it had done a U turn, what did it do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It moved towards the firms (?).</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And was any attempt made to interfere with you or any of your co-attackers... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Sorry, Mr Berger... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Sorry, my notes say that it made a turn at the robots, I didn't hear them saying it made a U turn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm sorry, maybe I got it wrong, but the Zulu was not... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Ja, (indistinct) said a turn, made a turn, made a turn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mbatha, just to be clear, this military vehicle, when it got to the robots, are you saying it turned right and moved towards the firms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what attempt was made to interfere with you or any of the co-attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, we were disturbed by their lights and we thought that they may have seen us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Other than that, was any attempt made to interfere with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It moved slowly, thinking that it had come at a higher speed, but this time it moved slowly, we thought it was suspecting something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Shots were fired, directed at this vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> By whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Domorotonga used his AK47 firing the shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Anyone else fire any shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, he is the only person I saw shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the soldiers, did they do anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, they just proceeded straight past the Cape Gate (?).</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, at the criminal trial, Mr Bojosi testified that he saw you at the stadium with a spear.   Is that false?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> He must be mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you did have a spear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I did have a spear on our way to Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he testified that later in Boipatong, he saw, he saw you chasing a person who had climbed out of a Peugeot motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just a second, if you don't mind.   You told us that when you arrived at the hostel that evening, you were told that it had been announced that the day has arrived, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you also say that people were supposed to arm themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Did they say people should arm themselves?   Yes, that's what I said, I wanted to know what was happening, and I was informed that Damara said that everybody should arm themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you went to your room and you fetched your assegai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where did you go to after fetching your assegai from your room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We then went out for intelezi(?), it was just outside the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Near the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you say that Bojosi was not telling the truth at the trial when he said he saw you with a spear at the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I was referring to the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you were near the stadium, or the arena in the hostel with a spear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So he was telling the truth, was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I would say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And later he said, or he says that he saw you later in Boipatong and he saw you chasing a person who had climbed out of a Peugeot motor vehicle.   That's correct, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I don't know whether he said that or not, I cannot remember very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know, what counsel is putting to you now is what was said by Bojosi at the trial.   You can take it that what counsel is reading to you is accurate, that's what Bojosi said at the trial.   Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So all that he wants to find out is whether, was he telling the truth when he... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, he was telling the truth, because yes I did those things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   His evidence is that the man had been hiding behind the Peugeot, was it not?   That is the witness' evidence, that's my recollection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> My note is that he tried - there was a Peugeot, he tried to conceal himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, behind the - yes, all right.   Yes.   Yes, thank you, Mr Berger.   You say he was correct, he was telling the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Moloi also gave evidence at the trial, and he said that he saw you on the road to Boipatong in possession of a spear.   He was also correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I would say that, because yes, I was in possession of a spear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, I want to show you, or ask that you be shown the map of Boipatong, Exhibit J.   Thank you.   Have you seen that map before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I do see this map, but I cannot make head or tail of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, let me try and explain it to you.   You'll see the little boxes in rows on this map, those are the houses in Boipatong.   On the left-hand side, I beg your pardon, on the right-hand side of the map, those little boxes are the houses in Slovo Park.   To the left of the map, but not on the map, is Kwamadala Hostel.   At the top of the map, that last street, Amatolo, is the last street in Boipatong before the firms, so the firms would be at the top of the map, but they're not indicated there.   At the bottom of the map is where you entered Boipatong, in the middle there, at the bottom.   Perhaps if my learned friend could point it out?    Thank you.   And then right in the centre of the map you will find the shops, and next to the shops you will see an empty space indicated as a park.   Now, are you in a position to indicate how you moved through Boipatong and where it was that you stabbed the two people that you spoke about yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I do not see a thing here, somebody may have to show me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me try a different approach.   The house where you found that woman, or a girl, I'm not sure, trying to jump out, and you asked her where the comrades were, remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You said that that house was near the shops?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Sorry, chair, if you'll just bear with me for a moment?   Chairperson, I'm in a difficult position, because I don't want to set off another, well I don't want to set off anything, and yet the victims want to know - want me to try and establish as accurately as possible who is responsible for the death of their loved ones, I'm going to be a little bit obtuse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what must be understood is that this committee is the only one which has to make a decision whether or not the applicants are entitled to amnesty, which is dependent upon whether the committee is satisfied that they have made the full disclosure and that whatever they did was associated with political motives, those are the issues that are we concerned with, and I think one has to be, all of us understand what happened that night, we're sensitive to that, but I think our duty is the one that I've just outlined.   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, chair, and in the interests of full disclosure, I have to put certain things, but I'm going to try and be as obtuse as possible, without being vague.   Mr Mbatha, at a house near the shops, five people were stabbed in that house... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you going through your memo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, I am... (intervention).</p>

<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's very close to the shops, in fact it's over the road from the shops, and that's the only house in the vicinity of the shops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it No 625?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Indeed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Five people were stabbed in that house, two men, two males and three females, I beg your pardon, three males and two females, and one of them, a very small boy, a very young boy, three of them young children, but a little older, and one a woman.   I don't know if I've put that accurately, but... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I'll take it that you are referring to the names that appear... (intervention).</p>

<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...across No 625?</p>

<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.   It is three males and... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Two females.</p>

<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I think it's accurate, you know, ja, it's fair enough.   Mr Mbatha, did you understand what counsel is putting to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you see, what I'm suggesting to you, Mr Mbatha, is that you're downplaying what happened in that house.   You say one person was stabbed, I'm putting it to you five people were stabbed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, it's not been established that this applicant was in that house, so I think it's an unfair statement to say that he's downplaying what happened in that house, because it's not been established that the applicant was in that specific house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that's a fair question.   The evidence that we've heard from Mr Mbatha is that he entered a house in the vicinity of the shops, he is not able to tell us which house, where he stabbed a woman.   Now, according to Mr Berger's instructions, as would appear from page 29 of the memorandum, at a house, No 625, which is in the vicinity of the shops, five people were stabbed, three males and two females.   So what's being put now is that that is the house where he went into, you know, and that he is under-playing his role, it's entirely up to him to say, "No, I didn't enter that house", or "I'm not under-playing", but I think that's the best way, I think, it can be, the issue can be canvassed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, chairperson, I can just put it that I also checked the e..., well the list of all the people that died and established that another house, with the same description, although it's not so close to the shops, it's not far from the shops, and that is Sinque 194, there two males died and one female, and that will also fit in with the evidence this witness gave at a previous occasion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's what re-examination is designed for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I take the point, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Sorry, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We're waiting for his comment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, I'll just - I'll put the question again, because there's been a delay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The house that my learned friend refers to, Mr Mbatha, is five blocks away from the shops, the house I'm referring to is over the road from the shops, and that was the only house in the vicinity of the shops where people were stabbed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, a vicinity is a relative concept, you know, is a relative concept, I think the question that you put was a fair question, just repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So the question I'm putting to you, Mr Mbatha, is that at that house in the vicinity of the shop five people were stabbed, and one of the people who were stabbed, and this is common cause, paragraph 6.6 of our memorandum, page 8 of the actual memorandum, was a 15 year old girl, who was stabbed with an assegai in the chest and the assegai went right through her.   Now I'm putting it to you that on your description, that is the house you went into, and I'm putting it to you that there wasn't one person in that house who was stabbed, but five?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would not know really, but I thought there was only one person and the male that I referred to, maybe the houses are confusing me, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mbatha, I think what's crucial that counsel is putting to you is not so much the houses, but what happened inside the house.   Do you understand what I'm saying?   The one thing that's important, as counsel points out is not which house you went into and what number the house bears, but one important thing that he puts to you is what happened in that house.   Do you understand the difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have told us that you stabbed a woman and a man at a particular house, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I did not say I killed the male.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no, that's the man who came out of, who had been concealing himself either in or outside of the Peugeot, who tried to jump the fence and you stabbed him and he ran away, as I understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, what counsel is putting to you is that at the house that you're talking about, three males were stabbed and two females.   The essence of what he's saying is this, you're not telling us the truth, you're under-playing what you did, you didn't only stab one woman who had just come out of the window, who tried to come out through the window, but you stabbed three males and two females, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you say to that?   Mr Berger, is that what you want to put to this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, it's either that, or there were other people with Mr Mbatha who stabbed the others in the house... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> ...but the essence is that to say that only one person was stabbed in that house, that is false.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you understand the qualification that he's just added?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, let's get the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I will not deny that, because there were many of us, there could have been others who went into the house and found other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, you see you would know if there were others in the house, because you were looking for comrades, you say, and after you killed that girl, you continued to search the house, because you've told the committee that you then went and opened the wardrobe, remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And it wasn't a big house, and you would easily have seen if there was a woman aged 39 in the house, a young boy aged 15, a small boy aged 7, a young man aged 19, you would have seen them in that small house if they were there, if they had been stabbed before or if they were hiding, because you searched that house, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The house was not small, it had rooms, I went to the wardrobe to search because I was suspicious, there were other rooms and some of my co-applicants came out of some of these rooms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And if anyone had been stabbed in the other rooms, you would have heard that, you would have heard people screaming in the house, Mr Mbatha.   You left that house because you were satisfied that there was no-one else in the house, isn't that what you've told the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not say that had there been any other person in another room I would have heard screams, I didn't say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, I'm putting it to you, you would have heard it if there was screaming?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would not say I would have heard such screams, because the one person that I stabbed was such that he didn't get a chance to scream.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mbatha, I'm just going to leave this point by putting it to you that you know more about what happened in this house and you are not telling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I do not dispute, I am saying I did not see anything else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who else was with you in this house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would not know, there was a commotion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You can't name a single person who was with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, you knew that this young woman was not a comrade, because you asked her, "Where are the comrades?", am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I knew that she was toeing the line of her comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> She was 15 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I don't know her, I estimated her to be my age.  I am not 15 years old, I am 35 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You knew she was not a member of the self defence units, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I did not know that, I just knew her to be a member of the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Oh, really, then why did you tell the committee yesterday that you stabbed her because you were frustrated and infuriated that you could not find the people that you were searching for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I was ventilating on her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were taking your anger at her?   That's exactly what counsel is putting to you, that you told us yesterday that you stabbed her because you were frustrated at not getting the people that you were looking for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Suggesting that she was not a member of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> She was a member of the SDU, except to say she was a female.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So is your evidence that, although she was a female, she was still a member of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, Mr Mbatha, why did you say that you stabbed her because you were infuriated and frustrated that you could not find the people that you were looking for, if she was one of the people that you were looking for?   It doesn't make sense?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, she was one of the people I was looking for, but then I had priorities, I had other people who came as first priority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mbatha, just help us understand what you're saying.   Yesterday you suggested in your evidence that she was not one of the persons that you were looking for, but you stabbed her because you were infuriated.   Today you are telling us that she was a member of the SDU, and we know that, from your evidence, you were looking for members of the SDU.   Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> May I please ask, what is this SDU, is it the same thing as the defence, really I don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well perhaps we use the term that you didn't use, I think you used the defence yesterday.   You see all the evidence we've been hearing here is to the effect that people, the hostel dwellers were looking for the SDU's, because they were primarily responsible for killing IFP members and hostel dwellers, that's what we've been told, so we assumed that when you referred to defences, you're also referring to SDU's, but perhaps you should tell us what is it, what is it that you understand by defences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I really cannot differentiate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you set out to look for defences, who were you actually looking for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I was looking for the people who were patrolling the streets, killing people.   These are the people whom I heard of as being SDU's, or defence should I say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is also what we understood from those applicants who referred to these people as SDU's.   Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well we come back then to the question, yesterday you told us, that's what counsel's putting to you, that you stabbed the woman because you were frustrated at not getting the people that you were looking for.    Do you remember telling us that yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What you're telling us today is that she was also a member of the defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would explain this as follows:  when I got to her, it's not that I didn't know, I knew that she too was a member, she too was toeing the same line as the others, except that she was not first in the list of priority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, I think the record speaks for itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, chairperson, my learned colleague who took notes of the evidence in chief, I couldn't take notes myself, but - points out that he said that was asked to her was, "Where are the other defences or comrades?", the other, the word "other" appears on the note.   I haven't got a recollection as to that detail myself, but that's been pointed out to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well the record will clear this up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is my recollection that's what was asked of the woman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it your evidence today that this girl was amongst the people that you were looking for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What is your reason today for having killed her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The reason is the same, that I was frustrated after failing to get the people that I was looking for, she did not even give me the information I was looking for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If she had said to you, "They are in the house next door", would you have killed her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would take her there, I would take her along to show me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> She says they're next door, would you have killed her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would have wanted to go and see them, I would bring her along.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You're going to take her along to a house where there are these dangerous people who could kill you, you wouldn't kill her first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you were acting on your own at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So there were other of your comrades standing around as you asked this girl where the others were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, they were present, even though I cannot recall what their names are, because some of them came in and went to other rooms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And if you had taken her next door and found that the defence were there, would you have killed her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would have killed her there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But then you wouldn't have been frustrated and infuriated, because then you would have found the people that you were looking for, so why would you have killed her?  What's the translation, sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> She is toeing the same line.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying it's because she associated herself with the defences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.   She is equal to the defences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's because she supported the defences, even if she wasn't a member of the defences, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I don't think that one can support an idea that one is against.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, one definitely can't, but she supported the defences, whether she was an actual member or not, when you say she toed the line, you're saying she was a supporter of the defences and that justified killing her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And as far as you were concerned, and all the residents of Kwamadala, all the people in Boipatong supported the defences and toed the line, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So therefore all the people in Boipatong, whether members of the defences or not, were targets for attack, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I would say that, but concerning children and old women, the aged, I don't think so, because they could not control their children.   I, for one, wanted people from around 45 years of age downwards, the same applies to females.   I did not care about the aged and children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So are you saying not all people in Boipatong were legitimate targets for attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And a seven year old boy was not a legitimate target for attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> He is still too young.   It's better to attack a person from ten years of age upwards, because those people are grown-ups.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, when you opened the wardrobe, was it in the same house and you found the two males, was that in the same house that you stabbed this young girl?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, you're referring to a young girl.  His evidence is not that he stabbed a young girl.   According to his evidence, the person that he stabbed was about his age.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I will rephrase it then.   I'll refer to her as a female.   The two males that you found in the wardrobe, was that in the same house as the female that you had stabbed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How big was this wardrobe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was big enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was it a standard, two door wardrobe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not notice that, I found both of them inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It was a wardrobe that stands against the wall, it's not part of a wall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I'm not sure whether it was a built-in wardrobe, but it didn't fall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And these two males were how old?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> When I looked at them, I think they were older than myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, did you in fact look at them when they fell out of the wardrobe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I opened the wardrobe because I wanted them to be shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> In other words they were shot at whilst the wardrobe was open?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I had already opened the wardrobe, they fell thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, we will take the tea adjournment at 11 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You've just told the committee that you opened the doors, you saw the two men hiding in the wardrobe, you could see that they were approximately your age, and Themba Mabota then shot and killed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, he said they were older than himself, Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I apologise.   You could see that they were older than you, the doors were open and Themba Mabota then shot and killed them, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yesterday you told the committee that you could not open the doors, Themba Mabota shot at them and you could see only their heads as they collapsed out of the wardrobe.  Which version is the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The wardrobe was open and they fell and I could see their heads out of the wardrobe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You told the committee yesterday that you could not open the doors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> How were their heads exposed if the wardrobe was not open?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I've been referred to a note by my learned colleague again, and I can just read from that.   Again, I don't have a recollection, because I didn't take a note</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>"I opened the wardrobe and found two males inside.  I called Themba Mabota.   They died, we saw these heads outside the wardrobe hanging."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understood his evidence, it was that he opened the wardrobe, found these two men, and then the wardrobe couldn't be opened, and then Themba Mabota shot at them.   Perhaps Mr Berger you would want to clarify whether when he opened the wardrobe, did they pull it back, so as to be shot once the wardrobe was closed, because it just seems to me not to make sense that he would see that there were two people inside without first opening the wardrobe, unless it had a glass (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I'll just clarify it briefly and then we can take the adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When Themba Mabota shot at the two males in the wardrobe, were the doors to the wardrobe open or closed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The door was already open and it was easy for one to shoot or to see a person inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you use the word "silbulga"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes we were struggling with the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> In other words are you saying that the occupants inside the wardrobe were trying - were holding the door so that you would not be able to open the door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Was it wide open or was it just open enough so that you could see the occupants inside the wardrobe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was opened in such a way that you could see that there were people inside, but they did not want us to open the door, the door was opened widely after they were shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So when they were shot, the doors of the wardrobe were closed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> They were not completely - the doors of the wardrobe were not completely open, we overpowered them as they were holding the door and as we were also trying to open the door, but the door was not completely closed and it was not completely open.   The door was shot at, the door opened thereafter because no-one was holding the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, perhaps this would be an appropriate time to take the adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.   We'll take a tea adjournment now, we will return at 11:30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>COMMISSION ADJOURNS FOR TEA </p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">PAULOS MCIKELENI MBATHA:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER CONTINUES:</span> Mr Mbatha, for the record, I just want to tell you that I was approached by Mrs Phale, P H A L E, during the adjournment and the young girl, aged 15, who died at 625 Bapele Street, the house over the road from the shops, was her daughter, and her name was not Ronica Msebe, as it is in the annexure, her name was Ronica Phale, and she was visiting the Msebes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the page again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's page 11 of the annexure, chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, all right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> She was visiting the Msebes on the night of the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Her name is Ronica Phale.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you spell that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> P H A L E.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Not Ronica Msebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But she was 15 and she was stabbed right through her body.   The other person that you stabbed - I'm sorry, before I get to that person - when I asked you earlier whether you could name anyone who was with you in the house where you stabbed the female, you said you couldn't, but you say that the house in which you shot, or in which the two males were shot, the two males who were trying to hide in the wardrobe, that was in the same house and Themba Mabota was in that house when you called him, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then you went to another house, and that was where you saw a person trying to escape, that's the person who tried to hide himself around the Peugeot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And can you indicate where that house was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> As I have indicated that I cannot point out, I was just walking, I'm not quite familiar with the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And who were you walking with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was Themba and the other people, I don't know them quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The only two people that you saw shooting were Damara Quonquo and Themba Mabota, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where did you see Damara shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I saw him shooting last shooting at the defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you never saw anyone else shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say that the lighting in Boipatong was bad, it was dark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was there not a full moon that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I do not know, but it was dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are there not Apollo lights in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was not lit, it was dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Berger, just to help us, those Apollo lights, are those those big mast lights that one sees in townships?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> (No audible reply).   After you had tried to kill the man near the Peugeot, you continued searching houses, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the only other house that you found people in was the house where Themba Mabota shot the male and the female under the bed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And how old were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why is there no mention of them in your statement, at page 210(I)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I wouldn't know, maybe I was not asked about them, we may, we could not have continued, or should I say it's possible we didn't continue with the questioning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then did you go into Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I don't know whether I did get there or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why do you say in your statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>"I was not in Slovo Park",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>if you don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I said I don't know whether I did get to Slovo Park or not.   I was just walking, I do not know the place, I think it was in the middle, we were in the middle of the township, so I could not make out my way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you follow Themba Mabota wherever he was going?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We parted ways.   We were destroying, we did not stick together all the way through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see people looting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, I did see some people in possession of items on our way out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did it surprise you to see them carrying these items?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, it did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you ask them, "Why are you carrying these things?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I did not, I did not even have that chance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Afterwards, back at the hostel, did you ask anyone why they had stolen stuff from Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> When we arrived, we did not have a chance to talk, we rushed into our homes to sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We knew that we had destroyed, so that even if there are suspicions, we should be asleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you enter the hostel through the main gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Together with everyone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would not know whether some people were left behind, but as far as I know, I think we all went in through the same gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Damara went through the same gate with you, didn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would say so, even though we could not see each other at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what did you do with your spear, your assegai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I came back from work the following day and discovered that the police had confiscated all the spears.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I think counsel wants to find out, when you returned to the hostel after the attack, what did you do with your spear?   Is that what - yes, or... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I kept it in my room as usual.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The next morning, what time did you wake up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I left quite early, because I had to be at work at six o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, when you got home to your room, did you wash your spear, did you wash it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who did you share a room with in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I was staying with Buthe and others, my brother and others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who were the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> They were others, whose name I don't know, it could be Tulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that the only name you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, there were two of them, Tulus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How many people were there in your room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We could have been five.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you all went on the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who stayed behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> My brother, he had gone to work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The others went on the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The next morning, what time did you leave the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I used to leave at five o'clock or round about ten to five.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you had no difficulty leaving the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I didn't have a problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There was no police presence, no military presence, no Iscor security, around the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I did not see any one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What time did you return from work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It was in the evening, quite late, it was quite late, because there was no longer public transport to Terela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So it would have been in the evening that you returned back to the hostel on Thursday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, it was not quite late, but I think it was headed for nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then you went back to your room and you went to sleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, but then when I arrived, there was a police contingent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On the Friday, did you go back to work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I could not</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> They didn't allow us to leave the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That was on the Friday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when you say "they", are you referring to the police and the army?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Iscor security?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I don't know whether they were present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when did you attend a meeting which was addressed by Themba Khosa, did you attend a meeting addressed by Themba Khosa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> The one meeting that I know, even though I cannot recall the date, that was the day on which the police did not allow us out of the hostel, that was the meeting, that is when - that was the day when he came along with the police, that's the meeting that I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But would that have been the first day during which you couldn't go to work because the police wouldn't allow you to leave the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.   The meeting was held, I'm not sure quite when, it could have been Friday or Saturday, I'm not quite sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that was the meeting where, in the presence of the police, Themba Khosa said you must help the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you didn't attend the meeting on the Thursday, the one on the 18th, that was addressed by Themba Khosa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And so you wouldn't be able to dispute it if I put it to you that at that meeting on the Thursday, Themba  Khosa instructed the hostel residents to burn all the evidence which linked them to the massacre, you can't dispute that, can you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would not admit, I would not dispute that either, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You don't know who gave the order to burn the goods looted from Boipatong and the evidence which linked you to the attack, am I right?</p>

<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Never heard about an ANC spy who infiltrated the hostel with plans to blow it up, never heard about such a person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I only heard about that when I was at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In Kwa-Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And did you ask questions about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why not, didn't you want to know if he's still there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I heard that he was allowed to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> To leave or to live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I was told that he was leaved, he left.</p>

<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who told you about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Dlamini told me that there is one person who came, but he was later released.</p>

<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Mbatha, will you please look at Exhibit M1, being the aerial photograph of Boipatong and its vicinity.   I see you've got the photograph in front of you.   If you look on the left-hand side, above the letter D, there's a road that runs across the photograph to above the letter M on the right-hand side, do you see that road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> That is Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, the road that separates Boipatong from the Kwamadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You'll see on that road there's a point marked H, that is where the footbridge is where the group crossed after the attack on the way to Kmadala.   Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Now if you look at point C, that's where the Trek Garage is, and you'll see, running in an easterly direction there's a road, that's Nobel Boulevard, it's the area which separates Boipatong and the factories, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And then if you look on the top of that photograph, do you see there's a point marked F?  If you look on the top of the photograph, do you see a point marked F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Do you agree that that is where Cape Gate is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> In fact, Cape Gate's premises extend from approximately that point right till the end of Nobel Boulevard, would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mbatha, can you yourself understand the, on your own, the photograph that's in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> My attorney did show this to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well your attorney is, your legal representative, is in fact pointing out certain things on the photograph for you, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, continue Mr Da Silva.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Now I understand your evidence to be, and you must please correct me if I'm wrong, that immediately after the attack, the group gathered in the veld between Boipatong and Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Would you agree that it was more or less in the middle of that veld that the group gathered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, it was just opposite the footbridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Would you agree, you say opposite the footbridge, would you say that the majority of the group was to the north of the footbridge, in other words towards the Trek Garage, or do you say that the group all congregated directly opposite the footbridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> That's where we had gathered, near the bridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Right.   And I understand your evidence to be that Mr Damara Quonquo was close to you, is that right, at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, even though he was not very close, but I could see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I haven't received a translation, Mr Chairman, but I assume the witness assented to that, he agreed with the proposition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> His answer was, even though he was not very close, but I could see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Thank you, Mr Lax, I didn't receive a translation.   And you say Damara fired in the direction of the military vehicle with an AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Was this AK47 set on automatic or was it single shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, as far as I know it was raised to fire a single shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Did Damara fire more than one shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I think he fired twice, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Now you also testified under cross-examination that the soldiers moved past Cape Gate, that was your testimony, in an answer to Mr Berger's question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> At what stage did you see the soldiers move past Cape Gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> They drove past Cape Gate after the shot was fired.   They wanted to stop before reaching Cape Gate, but then they continued driving past Cape Gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I'm sorry, Mr Chairman, I think my receiver's defective, I'm not receiving an answer at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> If you pick it up, Mr Da Silva, if you pick it up like that, then it will be in line with the transmitter, which is this little box just behind the TV.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Lax, while you're speaking, I'm not receiving anything at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you swop these, get, you know, another that's... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I've changed transmitters, Mr Chairman.  Mr Mbatha, the question was, when you saw this vehicle moving past Cape Gate, where were you at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> By that time we were approaching, just about to cross the road.    The cars, or the vehicle, was just about to turn at the robots, not yet, it had not yet arrived at Cape Gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> What I'm trying to establish is, you said that you saw the motor vehicle, or the military vehicle, move past Cape Gate, I want to know where were you at that stage when you saw the vehicle going past Cape Gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I am saying I saw it approaching Cape Gate during which time the shots had already been fired and we swiftly crossed the road to avoid being arrested in case the police come back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So are you saying that you had not crossed the road when the vehicle was in the direction, going in the direction of Cape Gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes, we were just about to cross the road when this vehicle approached Cape Gate and we could see it just about to disappear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You see, would you agree with me that this is a very flat area?   The point that I'm trying to make is that if one stands on the bridge, at the footbridge, you can't see Cape Gate, because Boipatong is in the way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And I understand your evidence now to be that the vehicle was going in the direction of Cape Gate, you did not in fact see it go past Cape Gate, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I did not see it go past Cape Gate, but I noticed that it was just about to move past Cape Gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Now when you saw the vehicle and you made the assumption it was going in the direction of Cape Gate, was the vehicle still at the Trek Garage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It had already gone past the garage or the filling station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you should just put to this witness, what your instructions are, because we seem to be going in some details, we have no idea what is it that you are disputing from his testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairman, I will put my instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, just put it to him and let's hear what he has to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Mbatha, you also testified that you saw this vehicle move from the left to the right in front of you.   At the stage that you saw it, were you still on the eastern side of the road, or had you crossed the road, when you're describing this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Would you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You testified, under cross-examination that you saw the military vehicle moving in front of you, from left to right, in other words, if you look at the letter M, the vehicle was driving in the direction of the Trek Garage to Sebokeng, that was your evidence, you saw it from left to right.   I want to know where you were when you saw this vehicle moving from left to right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> We were already outside Boipatong, just about to reach the footbridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So you were still in the veld, in the open veld, when you saw the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Would you agree with me that the vehicle that you saw did not move beyond the footbridge in Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, in other words it didn't go further than the footbridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> It drove past, it came from the direction of Vanderbijlpark, headed towards Sebokeng, and it turned at the garage, that is the Trek filling station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Mbatha, my instructions are that the vehicle did not come from Vanderbijlpark.   Do you have any comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I don't know where I should say it came from then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> My instructions are further that the first time the commander of that vehicle saw the group, it was in the vicinity of the robots near the Trek garage.   Do you have any comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I would not dispute that, because the vehicle was just in front of the garage, with their headlights on facing towards the east gate direction.   It was shot at when we were just closer to the garage and it proceeded on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> The vehicle moved slowly down Frikkie Meyer Boulevard in the direction of the footbridge, and stopped approximately 50 to 30 metres away from the group, because they were too scared of approaching the group and they were scared they might be attacked by the group.   Do you have any comment about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> The vehicle then turned around and moved back to the vicinity of the robots and it did not turn right in Nobel Boulevard in the direction of Cape Gate.   Do you have comment in that regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I am telling you my first-hand experience.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're telling us what you saw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I don't have any further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DA SILVA</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS TANZER:</span> Prior to the Boipatong attack, did you know, whether directly or indirectly, any policeman policing the area or the area of the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> The question is, did he know any per..., was he aware, did he know of any policeman that were in the Vaal Triangle around the area of the hostel, did he know them by name, either directly or indirectly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I still don't understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I think the question's quite simple, did he know any policemen, whether directly or indirectly, more specifically indirectly, did he know of policemen that were policing the Vaal Triangle prior to the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Are you trying to say did he know any of the policemen that may have been involved in policing the Vaal Triangle area in the vicinity of the hostel before the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Yes, that is my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I knew no police who were policing the vicinity of the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Now when you said on the day after the attack Themba Khosa addressed the residents of the hostel, and he was accompanied by policemen... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, the evidence was that two days after the attack, I understood it, the Friday, not the Thursday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I apologise, two days after the attack, and he was accompanied by policemen, had you seen these policemen before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> And it was not the policemen that were identified here a few days ago?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I haven't seen them before, I just saw them for the very first time here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did these policemen identify from which station they came from, or from where they came?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I cannot remember whether they said they were coming from Van der Byl or from Vereeniging, I cannot recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Now last question, you said the next day you left early to work, did you take public transport that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> I boarded a taxi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did you take a taxi from Terela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBATHA:</span> No, I did not go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I have no further questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, as far as I know at this moment he hasn't arrived, but apparently he works at the taxi rank at Vereeniging, but that's the only information I have, but he's not here.</p>
