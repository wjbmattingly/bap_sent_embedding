<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why were you prepared to go to Boipatong to kill people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> I wanted to pay a revenge for what they did to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> During that period, could you move freely out of the hostel, in the townships, or not?</p>

<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Whose group were you in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> I was in Mkhize's group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When you went to Boipatong, what was your idea, what would happen in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> We were going to attack and kill members of the Self Defence Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you briefly describe what happened in Boipatong when you arrived there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Before we entered Boipatong, we sat under the tree, then we divided ourselves into two groups.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, and after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> We entered in the last street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, I want you to continue with what happened in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> When we entered in that street, that is where we had a barricade next to a house, in front of that, on the other side of the tank, there were a group of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>	I thought those were members of the Self Defence Unit because they were of our age.  After that, we directed fire to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Could you see who was firing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> The one who was next to me, shooting, was Doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What kind of firearm did he use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> He had a pumpgun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see anybody else firing shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Who did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What kind of firearm did he have with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> He had an AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What happened when those shots were fired in the direction of the Self Defence Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> They ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Others entered the houses nearby, others ran on the street.  Then we ran after them, those who were in the houses, and others followed those who ran through the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Personally, what did you do whilst you were moving through the streets of Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> I was not able to catch one of them, we entered in one yard and we broke the window panes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Apart from that one house, did you break windows at other houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, the others continued to break windows in other houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you tell the Committee what else did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> After I broke those windows, there was a house on the corner which I opened the door.  After I had opened that door, a group of people entered that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>	Whilst they were inside the house and whilst I was continuing breaking the windows, one person burnt a blanket which was inside the house.  I took that blanket and threw it inside the house.  Whilst we were breaking the windows of that house, I jumped the (indistinct) and entered in another big house next door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>	I broke the windows, the big window panes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you enter the house or did you enter the yard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> I only broke the windows, I never entered that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> When people entered that house, others took TV's, there was one who was scared to take the TV, the big TV.  The person who picked up the big TV, was a little big scared and put it down, then I took it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know the name of that person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> No, I was not able to identify that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At this point, you were at the hostel at that stage, since approximately January to April 1992, did you know many people in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, there were people I knew, and many of them were those who came from the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And do you know the names of all the people in the hostel or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> No, I don't know them all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In any event, you were telling that you then received a TV from this person.  What did you do with the TV?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> When we left Boipatong, then we proceeded to Madala hostel, we saw police vans.  Then I put it down, because I was scared that I would be arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can you give an indication, where did you see the police vans that you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Those cars we used to call them suitcases, and they belonged to the SADF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But where, where did you see that vehicle or vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> They came from the direction of between Tserela and as if they were going towards Vanderbijlpark, and they turned at the robot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The robot that you refer to, is that the robot at the intersection of Nobel Boulevard and Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Whilst you were in Boipatong itself, did you witness any killing of any person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> No, I never saw any person being killed inside Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you take the same route back to the hostel which you took when you went there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> No, we never used the same route when we returned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When you went to the hostel, did you still have that TV with you or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> I left it behind.  I held that iron bar which I had when I went inside Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When you got to the hostel, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> I went straight to my room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When did you hear for the first time that many people were killed and injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> I heard the following day, in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know anything of loot being burnt after the attack in the kwaMadala hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> It was Richard, that is Richard, Matanda and Mkhize, those who were going around the rooms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The Mkhize you refer to in your statement, is that Bhekinkosi Mkhize?</p>

<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> I know because we used to go and visit him in Vanderbijl in the cells or in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> You say there were two groups of attackers in Boipatong.  Can you tell us how big the group was more or less, how many people it consisted of, the big group?</p>

<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> How big was the group of the AmaButho going to Boipatong, how many people did it consist of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Approximately we could have been 200 to 300.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> The trouble you had in the township, you say where the SDU shot you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, can you just repeat the figure, we just didn't catch it very clearly on the interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> It is approximately between 200 to 300.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> You say you left Sebokeng because you were shot by the comrades.  Who were in charge of the comrades in Sebokeng, which organisation or didn't they belong to an organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> They were ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Were the comrades and the SDU's the same people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> To my understanding, I think it means the same people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Did you ever attend a meeting during that week from the 10th until the 18th of June, where Themba Khoza addressed the residents of kwaMadala?</p>

<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were asked whether, you talked about two groups that went into Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then you gave the figure of approximately 200 to 300 persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that an estimate of persons in one group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Da Silva?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DA SILVA:</span> May it please you Mr Chairman.  Can you give an estimate of when the group entered Boipatong, what time was that more or less to start the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Well unfortunately I cannot estimate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Can't you estimate at all, do you know if it was late in the evening, near midnight, later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Well, it was not yet midnight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You say that you saw, your testimony was that you saw police vans, and because of this you put the TV down, because you were scared that you were going to be arrested?  Do I make the correct deduction that when you saw this police van that you mentioned, that you were in the open veld between Boipatong and Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Can you estimate how far you were from this police van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> It was quite a distance.  Let me explain this, I said we saw military vans, not the police vans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> It was translated as police vans, are you saying that it was interpreted incorrectly just now when you testified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Mr Da Silva, he did correct it.  He spoke about, he used some unusual term, suitcases.  He said these vans were SADF vehicles, we used to call them suitcases, they were coming from Tserela towards Vanderbijl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I would like to clarify this aspect, because the actual evidence was we saw police vans, I put it down because I thought I was going to be arrested.  They are suitcases of the SADF and I would like the witness to clarify that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> That was a mistake from the interpretation not the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The Interpreter is saying that was his mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I understand sir, thank you.  In regard to the distance, can you estimate how far you were when you saw this vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> I think it can be a distance from this wall to the back of the hall there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairman, that is approximately 30 meters I would estimate, 30 meters.  I can measure that tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Unless something turns on the distance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We are happy with 30 meters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To the extreme that it may be necessary, just pace the distance roughly and let us know for the record tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I will do so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You described this or let me clarify this aspect, your testimony was that you saw suitcases, your testimony interpreted incorrectly was police vans.  Did you see one vehicle or more than one vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> I saw three vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I didn't hear the figure, please repeat it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> I saw three vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Can you describe these vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, I can describe them.  They are brown vehicles.  When it is facing you, you only see the driver, so the people who are sitting at the back, you only see their heads and their hats.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>	There is a big iron on top of it, that is why we refer to it as a suitcase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And you are quite sure you saw three vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, I am sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Were all three vehicles as you describe them, suitcases?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you ask him whether all three vehicles were in suitcases?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I will follow that up Mr Chairman.  The vehicles that you saw, were all three vehicles as you describe them, suitcases?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> All of them were suitcases.  We used to call them suitcases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And you mention suitcases because of this iron bar on top, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Now you know the difference between a military vehicle and a police vehicle?  At that stage my information was that police vehicles were painted yellow or green or camouflage, were you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, I am aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So after you saw these vehicles, you put down the TV and then what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Then I joined the group and then we crossed over the road.  We were all rushing, we only wanted to cross over the road, so that we can be near our place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> To join the group, did you move away from these vehicles, towards the group, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> They were facing the road that is moving towards Vanderbiljpark, so we were just passing in front of those vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>	After they had turned at the robot, they were moving with a slow pace, so we managed to cross over the road in front of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So, the road that you crossed was Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Well, I don't know the name of that road, but it is the road that moves from the garage towards Vanderbijlpark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Do I understand your evidence to be that when you saw these vehicles on your version, that they were on the same road as you crossed, the group crossed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So the first time you saw these vehicles, on your version, these vehicles were on this road, and then you crossed in front of them, crossing Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So where did you leave the TV?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> I left the TV at the open veld before the crossed the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Do you know a gentleman by the name of Daniel Mabote or Themba Mabote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Was he part of the group that perpetrated the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Do you remember him being in the group when you gathered in the veld?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Do you remember if he was armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> What was he armed with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> He was armed with a small gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Were you quite close to him when you were in the group in the veld, when you were gathering in the veld?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> From when we entered Boipatong, I was always next to a person armed with a gun.  Even when we returned, I was always next to Themba Mabote because he had a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> At the criminal trial you heard the evidence of a Mr Holi Bajozi, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, I heard his evidence but I don't remember what he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> With reference to Mr Themba Mabote, he testified that Mr Themba Mabote fired a gun in the direction of a Defence Force vehicle, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So you recall that when Mr Mabote saw the Defence Force vehicle, that he actually fired in the direction of the Defence Force vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And he was pointing his firearm at the Defence Force vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And how many times did he fire his firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Even though I do not remember, but he ... (tape ends) ... that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> It stands to reason, he also thought he was going to be arrested, and that is why he started firing at the Defence Force vehicle, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Well, I don't know why he fired at the military vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> But he must have had a similar fear that you had, he thought he was going to be arrested, that is why he fired?  Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Well, I don't want to agree, what I can say is that I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Yes, but you say he fired more than once, you were standing next to him?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> After you crossed Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, is it correct that between kwaMadala hostel and Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, on the eastern side of Frikkie Meyer Boulevard there is a marsh, do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> There was an affidavit handed in, it is Exhibit L earlier in this enquiry, and it is in fact two affidavits by Security personnel of ISCOR, if I remember correctly their affidavit is that they arrested a person whose legs were wet up until the knees.  Is that possible because you crossed this marsh that you would have got wet in crossing the marsh?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Well, where we crossed on our way from Boipatong, there is a footpath, there were no water.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> How did you enter kwaMadala hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> On our return from Boipatong, we passed the ISCOR place surrounded by the trees, and then we moved on the other side of the bridge towards kwaMadala hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Weren't there people hiding in the marsh from the Defence Force vehicles?  Are you aware of that, was there any person which formed part of your group, that were hiding in the marsh?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> No, I heard about that in court, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Is it not correct that part of the group entered kwaMadala through a hole in the fence in kwaMadala, do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> The first time I heard about that, was in court.  What I remember is that we returned, using the same way that we used when we went to Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>	The first time I heard about people who damaged the fence, I heard about it in court for the first time.  I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So did you not use this hole in the fence to enter kwaMadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> No, we did not use the fence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You say you put the TV down because you were scared of being arrested by the Defence Force vehicles.  Did they normally arrest people, what was your experience?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Since during the times of the riots in the township, they used to arrest people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So you were expecting them to arrest you, you weren't expecting them to cooperate with you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> If they had been cooperating with you, you would have carried the TV over the street and you wouldn't have been scared of them, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I want you to think carefully back, my information is that there was one Defence Force vehicle on Frikkie Meyer Boulevard.  Is it possible that you are making a mistake, that you only saw one vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> No, it is not a mistake, I saw three vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Why don't you make mention of the vehicles in your affidavit?  You made an affidavit describing the attack and you don't mention them in your affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Well, I don't know why it doesn't appear there, but I told my lawyer that I took a TV and I left it on the open veld and the reason why I left it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So you are saying, you consulted with your lawyer and your lawyer made a mistake?  Is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And you also told him you saw three vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> That is an important aspect that is not in your affidavit?  Can you give an explanation why that is left out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Well, I cannot explain why it does not appear on my affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I put it to you that you are mistaken, and that all you saw was a single solitary buffel on Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> I disagree with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And did you see this buffel, what it was doing before you crossed Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Well, I don't know what is a buffalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Okay, let's call it a suitcase.  Did you see what the suitcase was doing, before it crossed Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> The first time that I saw this suitcase, it was moving from Cape Gate along the road, towards Vanderbijlpark.  It was moving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And then it must have turned left in Frikkie Meyer Boulevard because you explained that you saw it in Frikkie Meyer Boulevard.  Do I understand your evidence to be that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> The first time that I saw this vehicle, it was next to the firm and the garage and then it turned left towards Vanderbijlpark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>	They reduced their speed and then they ended up stopping and that is when we crossed the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> In what direction was the headlights of this vehicle looking, was it in the direction of the group or was it away from the group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> They were facing towards Vanderbijlpark.  They were not facing at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So they turned around?  Is that what you are saying, they were looking away from the group, at Vanderbijlpark, towards Vanderbijlpark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> They were not going to Vanderbijlpark, they were just facing towards Vanderbijlpark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Were they ever facing in your direction, in the direction of the group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Let me put it this way, only one of them faced in our direction because it was turning around, so the others just reversed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> At what stage was this one, that was facing in your direction, was this while you were crossing Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And where were the other two that were reversing?  The answer hasn't been interpreted to me Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He wants to know whether you mean when they were crossing the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you repeat the answer?  Mr Interpreter, is there a problem there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The applicant was asking a question whether does he want to know when we were crossing the road, when these two cars were reversing or not?  He is asking the legal representative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The question is, what were the other two vehicles doing while you were crossing the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You referred to the two that were reversing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman, I want to know where were these two vehicles that were reversing, while the applicant was crossing the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> They were at the back, because they were reversing while we were crossing the road, they were next to the robots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Will you please look at a photograph of the scene, it has been handed in as Exhibit M1.   Do you have the phonograph in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Do you see there is a road that runs across the photograph, approximately just above point (d) on the left hand side, to point (m) on the right hand side, do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> If you look along that road, you will see at the top of the page, there is a point marked (h), that indicates a foot bridge on Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Right, is that where the group crossed from Boipatong into kwaMadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And I understand your testimony to be that the first time you saw these vehicles, was after the attack, while you were gathering on the eastern side of Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, in that veld between Frikkie Meyer Boulevard and Boipatong, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Only after the attack was completed, did you see these vehicles, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> The first time I saw them, they were there at point (c).</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Point (c) is where Unipark Motors is, that is where the Trek garage is?  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is correct.  Point (c) is where the garage is, at the back there, there is a firm.  So the first time I saw them, they were there and then they turned left at the garage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> If you are saying they turned left, does that mean, did they move in that direction along Frikkie Meyer Boulevard in the direction of the foot bridge, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So the first time you saw this vehicle, the attack had already been completed.  You were gathering to go to kwaMadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Right.  Now, the two vehicles that were reversing, were they reversing in this Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So were they reversing towards the group, you are saying that the headlights were not facing you, that they were reversing.  Do I make the correct assumption, were they reversing towards the group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> No, they were reversing towards the robot next to the garage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So were they reversing from the garage towards the robot, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> They were not reversing from the robot, they were reversing, I don't know how can I explain this.  Let me explain it this way, there at point (e), when you go down with that road, they started reversing from that point towards the robot, until they reached the robot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So you are saying that they were at point (e) at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> They were not exactly at point (e), but when you move down that road, they reversed from there towards the garage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Why do you refer to point (e)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Just to save time, I have been looking at the indication here, what the witness is doing, is extending that line of point (e) right to Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, that is not on Noble Boulevard, but he just uses that as a marker, but he points to Frikkie Meyer, lower down, so you must actually extend that line to Frikkie Meyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have a pen, could you ask the witness to please indicate the - on the map, on that Exhibit, the point at which he saw those vehicles?  Show it to Counsel.  Can you have a look at that?  Is that the mark that is almost below (e)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I understand so Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I understand it to be at the end of the nursery.  You will note that there is a ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mazibuka, will you please put a circle on the mark that you have made so that we can see which one it is, there are two x's there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>	Show it to Mr Da Silva first.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Mazibuko, the point that you have marked is on the road, on Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, at the end of the nursery, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You testified earlier and I understood your evidence to be that the other two vehicles, the vehicles that were reversing, were reversing from the garage to the robot, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> They were not reversing from the garage to the robot.  They were reversing from that point, that is where they stopped and one of them, turned around and the two of them reversed from that point that I have already indicated, and they reversed from that point to the garage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Mazibuko, my information is that immediately after the attack, there were only to use your words, two suitcases available and if necessary I will lead evidence to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>	Aren't you mistaken when you say you saw three vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> No, I did not make a mistake, I saw three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Yes, there were only two vehicles available from Vaal Commando and only one vehicle was in this vicinity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZIBUKO:</span> Well, I did not see one vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I don't have any further questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DA SILVA</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.   The time now is approximately half past five.  Ms Tanzer, we intend rising at this stage.  Do you have any objections to commencing your cross-examination tomorrow morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> None whatsoever, I can prepare Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Yes, thank you.  Just before I forget this point, Mr Da Silva, the witness has been referring to a suitcase and you have been referring to what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> A buffel vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Does your, is what you understand to be a buffel, the same thing as what he refers to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, my information and my instructions are that a buffel is (indistinct) known in the area, in Boipatong, as a suitcase.  It is one and the same vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you put it to this witness that according to your information, there was one Defence vehicle, buffel, in and around that vicinity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> That is correct, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right.  Is there, on your information, is there any indication at what time that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I can revert to you tomorrow morning and I will be able to give you an approximation of the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, because it may well be that he did see these two motor vehicles, but at some other stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Yes, I will do that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So will you please be - okay, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>	Mr Strydom, after this witness, after this applicant, who do you intend calling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Tebogo Magubane.  I have been given the assurance that he has arrived in Vereeniging, he is in Vereeniging prison and he will be here tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Mr Da Silva, the Committee has decided to accede to your request that we start tomorrow morning at nine o'clock and finish at five o'clock.</p>
