<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The first matter set down for hearing to-day was the adjourned matter of the application of Messrs Gumbi and Zuma.  The matter was adjourned for today, after Mrs Dlamini had given evidence.  The purpose of the adjournment was to enable the legal advisors of the Applicant and the evidence leader to check on various aspects of her evidence and to get her evidence transcribed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	It gives me - I'm very sad to have to say that we have been told this morning that since the hearing on Monday, her child at this hearing - at this hall on Monday has died.  In those circumstances we feel it would be totally wrong for Mrs Dlamini to have to give evidence today and be subjected to cross-examination.  It would be both unfair to her and unfair to the cross-examiner who would obviously feel in those circumstances that he would have to treat the witness with kid-gloves and we have agreed that is, the members of the Committee, having discussed the matter with the various legal advisors appearing that the only proper course to follow, is to adjourn this matter to a date to be arranged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	We would like to - is Mrs Dlamini still here?  We would like to express and I'm speaking now on behalf of all the members of the Committee, our deepest sympathy to Mrs Dlamini and trust that she will be comforted by those around her and attention...(inaudible) and perhaps the attention of friends and neighbours and we adjourn now to give her time to recover.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, members of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I gather the next matter is not ready to proceed yet so we will adjourn again - if you'll notify us as soon as you're ready.</p>
