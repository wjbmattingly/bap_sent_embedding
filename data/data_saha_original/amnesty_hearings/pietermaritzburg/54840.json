Somewhere during June 1991 on the 23rd there had been an attack on us at our area.   People entered our area which was a low-lying area and they were coming from above and they shot at us and one person was shot and then we started running because we never expected to be attacked.  However, we came back.  When coming back the attackers ran away.\n\tWe stayed there and we gathered trying to find out as to how we are going to survive because we knew we are not going to be able to sleep.  We sat and discussed.  One of us by the name of Mbandla came with a view that we should pay revenge.  However it was quickly said that we can do it voluntarily, we are not forced to join the revenge.  Some people volunteered to go and attack, and I was one of them.  \n\tMyself and my fellow accused we arrived at the first home that was the Dlamini family and in front of the house there was a young boy standing there.  When arriving there we suspected that the house might be one of the camps where our attackers had camped therefore we started surrounding the house and we got into the house or family or homestead.  We started shooting at the person who appeared at the door.",

            "There was one person standing outside of the door, one of us shot at the person.  That person wasn't seriously wounded, he managed to run away and we managed to get into the house or the homestead.  When we arrived inside the house we found it was dark, we couldn't see clearly, therefore myself I don't remember well, it looks like we were competing to fight or attack the people because we were many.  However, I took part.  There was one person who was injured, I don't remember well, but when I found out later it was Gogo, it was Grandma maDlamini.\n\tWe were over 60 in number and I don't remember exactly.  However, we grouped into two, the others had to attack one of the homesteads nearby.  We injured one of the aunts and a child and we, after attacking that house, we continued to the other houses which had the light switched on because we thought there might be people inside these houses.\tWe were of the view that there wasn't anybody in those houses because it was rumoured that they had to leave that place.  All we knew that is that if ever we find a house with lights on there must be people inside.\n\tWe continued to the next homestead, that was the Kunene family.  The other group have already attacked that house so we passed that house and we went to another place called Matafene.  There we found some aunties in the bushes. We met them as we were passing.  One of the aunts was carrying a child, or had a child with her.  We told her to run away and she ran away towards the bushes.  Again we continued and we met other people on the way.  And I also suspect that the one that we met was also injured by the other group.\n\tAs we started arguing with the other group that they shouldn't take women and we had to take the young child and save her, however, we differed in opinion. We took the young child together with us and continued and we left the child at the Dlamini family and told them to take the child to court the next day.\n\tWe continued to Mtolo's family.  Mr Mtolo is an IFP member at that place.  He is also the one who informed us as to where the other people were camping.  He was referring to the ANC members.  He said we are going to find them at Zwandile Mbongo's home.  We also surrounded the house. While surrounding the house there was some shooting from inside the house.  I suspected that they saw us and we also entered the house while shooting and I was also in possession of a 9mm, a shotgun and also a spear.  There were some other people who were carrying big guns and one of them is my co-accused in the trial was also carrying a big firearm and most of us were armed.\n\tWe entered the house and we started shooting.  When we got there it was this house, a rondavel, and we started shooting through the windows and we injured a lot of people there.  I think there were four, but some of them survived.\n\tAfter that incident we continued to the Tosi family.  This Tosi man used to regard himself as an IFP leader in that particular area.  We arrived at Tosi's place and we had to pass his place because we ran out of ammunition and we thought he could help us with ammunition.  He gave us about eight rounds of ammunition and we continued to a place called Tshlahle.  I don't know this family name but the place was known by the name of Tshlahle.  \n\tWe arrived at one homestead, the lights were on, people were drinking in that family.  We shot one man and he died and also some other people whom we met on the way.  After attacking that particular homestead of Tshlahle people who came towards their house were also attacked by us and they died instantly.\t\n\tWe continued and we were going back.  When passing Matafene on our way back we passed the first homestead we found women, we didn't do anything to them.  However, on the second family we found women, we injured those women, I don't remember the number, there might have been four or five, so we were arguing at the time and we were not of the same view among our group.  Most people survived, they knew that we were divided at the time, I mean within us, our camp, some people said we shouldn't kill women, others insisted that we should kill them.  After that we went back home and that is how it ended.",
