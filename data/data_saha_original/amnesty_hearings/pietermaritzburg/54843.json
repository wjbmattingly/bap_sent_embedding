While looking for another target I heard music noise.  I went to inspect and found many white dancing inside this disco.  I reported that we can attack there.  Tanda then gave the order that we attack.  Only Tanda and I went to attack and one remained in the car and another was to give us firing cover as it became necessary.  When we got there the burglar door was locked.  It was not locked on my first inspection.  We stood just outside the door and fired inside.  The attack lasted about three seconds.  We got into the car and sped away\"\nDo you understand that and do you accept that that is what you told your counsel?",

            "Just a moment, before we go that far,  I'm uncomfortable about that aspect of the matter.  I think I must confer very quickly with my colleagues.\n\tBefore we, and in fact I don't think subject to what people may say and having conferred with my colleagues I think I'm still feeling very uncomfortable about whether we should counsel to explain what happened during his consultation with his clients.  It's just not done unless exceptional circumstances do exist to what I'm not so sure whether they do in this case.  \n\tBut perhaps Mr Prior I appreciate your concern but I think though that simply speaking it is not correct that you are prevented from using the statement because once the statement is given to you, you are free to use it in cross-examination like you have done.\n\tIt would have been something quite different if once you started wanting to use that statement Mr Arendse objected and said: \"No, you can't use that statement because during consultation my client told me that it was not true and soforth, he didn't do that\".  \n\tHad he done so we probably would have overruled him and said: \"Well, let your clients give an explanation\".  So you are free to use it in cross-examination and you did in fact use that statement during cross-examination.\n\tOnce you confront a witness with a statement which he would have made in consultation with his counsel, like an affidavit, once you confront him with the contents thereof and he says: \"Well, that's not what I told my counsel\", you can't take it further.\n\tUnless for some reason counsel himself feels that the witness is lying and counsel has got some other reasons why he would like to prove the witness a liar, like for example counsel wants to say that he feels that perhaps it's a reflection on himself and he wants to go into the witness box and then he wants to contradict the witness.\n\tBut once the witness has said: \"That's not what I told my counsel\", there could be a host of reasons.  For example plain ordinary misunderstanding between the two of them during consultation.  And we normally just leave it there once a witness has said: \"I didn't say that\".\n\tPerhaps I should say this because it would appear that you're going to have possibly more of this kind of problem and we don't want to set a precedent where we call upon counsel to come and explain because in terms of the proposed guidelines which have not as yet been proclaimed, the new guidelines which we have drafted, it seems to me that legal practitioners are going to be required in advance to submit a summary of the statements by their clients like just happened now.\n\tI can foresee that while this is going to be helpful in the sense that the leaders of the evidence would know in advance more or less what the applicants are going to say.  We are going to also have this kind of problem where the statement will be found to be wanting in one or more respects.  \n\tAnd if on each such occasion when an applicant says: \"Well that is not what I told my advocate\", we would require of an advocate or an attorney to give an explanation, I think it would lead to an untenable situation.  \n\tAnd I don't think we should start today to create that kind of precedent.  We are not saying that it can never happen but for now we feel that each has been sufficiently ventilated and that it should be left there.",

            "Thank you Mr Chairman, learned members of the Committee for allowing us some time to prepare very roughly a closing argument.\n\tMr Chairman, members of the Committee, the applicants have applied for amnesty in respect of several offences committed during an attack on the Crazy Beat Disco in Newcastle on the 14th of February 1994 when one person was killed and two people were injured.\nThese offences included murder, attempted murder and possession of arms and ammunition and hand grenades.\n\tThe applicants were properly convicted and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for committing those offences and they were convicted and sentenced in May of 1994.\n\tMr Chairman, although another tribunal trial court and therefore expressing it's opinion found the applicants and guilty and sentenced them.  We respectfully submit that the trial court was well placed to make it's findings on the evidence before it and it's therefore important to note that some of these findings included the following factual findings.\n\tThat applicant Molefu was a member of the PAC at the time and that applicants Shiceka and Tanda were soldiers of APLA.  The trial court also found that these offences were committed with a political objective, namely to further the aims and objectives of APLA.\n\tIn fact the court found that the applicants carried out the orders given by APLA High Command on the evidence before you by one, Power Mzala, also referred to as Jones.  \tThe trial court also found that these offences were not committed for any personal gain. \n\tWe respectfully submit Mr Chairman and members of the Committee, that the uncontroverted evidence of the applicants before you confirm that trial court's findings.  Based on these findings it is submitted that the applicants are entitled to amnesty and they have complied with the requirements of Section 20 of the Act. \tAlthough not a factor in terms of the statute it is of importance and relevance to the whole reconciliation process, the attitude of victims.  In this case none of the victims oppose amnesty.  Mrs Swart who is here whose daughter was killed abides the decision of this Committee.\n\tIf there is any basis for objection to this application then it's because of an alleged lack of full disclosure.  In this regard we respectfully submit that the applicants have disclosed all the relevant and material facts relating to the Crazy Beat Disco incident before, during and after the incident.\n\tThe evidence before this Committee in summary is as follows:\n\tAn order was given by Power Mzala in January that targets needed to be identified in Newscastle for the purpose of APLA carrying out certain operations.  \n\tMzala gathered together a unit comprising, Tanda, Shiceka, Sitembele and Funani who are not before this Committee, they formed the unit.  \nTanda was told that he commands the unit.\n\tTanda was also told that he must identify the targets.\n\tThey came to Newcastle, Tanda identified two targets, namely the restaurant and the Crazy Beat Disco.\n\tThey were identified on the basis that these targets are frequented by white people and they were told, in fact it was part of the order that they should do so.\n\tThe arms and ammunition were brought from Umtata by motor car by Molefu already in 1993.  He stored and hid these arms at his place here in Newcastle during all this time.  And these are the arms and ammunition used by the applicants to launch the attack on the disco.\n\tTo launch the attack a car was highjacked and that car was highjacked by Tanda and the two other members of his unit.  Shiceka was not one of them.  Molefu was driving the other vehicle which took them to the highjacked car.\n\tAs far as the operation itself is concerned Tanda and Shiceka have admitted and confessed to you that they were directly involved in perpetrating the attack.  They were armed with automatic weapons and grenades.  The automatic weapons were used.\n\tMolefu was involved in the attack, he supported it, he knew about it.  But his involvement was confined to a supporting role both before the attack and after the attack.  In fact he was arrested together with Tanda and Shiceka the next day, February the 15th.\n\tMr Chairman, the applicants have shown remorse, they have asked for forgiveness and we submit with respect, that their plea is a genuine one and that they too are the victims of our apartheid past as much as the actual victims are, who were either killed or injured during this attack.  And therefore Mr Chairman, they deserve amnesty.\n\tIn terms of supporting our submissions we would just like to refer to the decisions given in the Coetzee application and the Mitchell application and we submit that the case of the applicants before you is even more clear cut, if one can put it that way, than both of those decisions given by this Committee.\n\tThank you Mr Chairman.",

            "Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I only wish to draw the Committee's attention to certain aspects of the evidence, as well as certain aspects of the Act and certain general considerations when considering whether amnesty should be granted or not.\n\tI wish to refer to the submission made by a Mr D.J. Ackerman and Mr V.L. Smith, who represented the victims at the St James attack.  No doubt Mr Chairman you were involved in that matter and you'd alive to those considerations.  With submission I submit they are also of application here.\n\tThe submission made is that the Committee ought to be mindful that not every act committed in a political context is an act of a political character or one associated with a political objective.  \n\tSecondly, nor is every politically motivated act or every act committed in a name of a political party such an act.  \n\tAnd thirdly, nor does a political slogan amount to a political objective which justifies murder.  Particularly in the light of what the APLA command had indicated, Mr Sabelo Palma, that 1994 was to be \"The Year of the Ballot and the Bullet\".  That certainly doesn't justify murder at any level.\n\tNow the Committee must also be mindful of the limitations which is placed on acts, whether they can be categorised as acts of a political character or associated with a political object.  And in the respect the well-known principles upon which our Founding Act is based, being the Norgaard principles, I think it's appropriate to say that it was clear in the Namibian context where the Norgaard principles applied, that attacks on purely civilian targets were not considered to be acts of a political nature or sufficient political nature which justified amnesty.\n\tIt is also important to analyse whether the act of the applicants before this Committee was carried out in the furtherance or as assistance to the political objective alleged.  The general political objective stated by the applicants was to liberate AZANIA to dismantle the apartheid regime or the apartheid state and rewin the land taken by the oppressors.\n\tIt is significant that none of the applicants were able to explain how the attack on the discotech could have advanced that objective.  In contra distinction to that I think the Committee, with respect, ought to be mindful that the process which was in place at the time and in which is common cause, that is the negotiations which led to the elections in April, were far more likelier to achieve the ends which the attack was allegedly intended to achieve were in fact successfully in operation at the very time of the attack which was only two months away.\n\tIt is also significant that the very political party to which they belonged were party to those negotiations and were actively involved in those negotiations.  \n\tIt would appear from the evidence that all was not well in the PAC camp.  It appears from the evidence that during the conference at Umtata there appeared to be two schools of thought, one opposing violence and the other advocating violence or the armed struggle to continue.\n\tThat also seems to be borne out by the press clippings annexed to the bundle, which seems to indicate that the politicians were saying one thing, suspending the armed struggle, yet APLA was saying another thing.\n\tAnother aspect is the gravity of the act in questions.  It is significant that defenceless civilians who pose not threat, and certainly on the evidence, were unconnected to any state, organisation, or body were the object of the attack.\n\tIt is also significant that the weapons used, automatic machine rifles and hand grenades, although they weren't in fact used, the intention was to create maximum carnage.\n\tThe applicants have said they've acted under orders and in that context they were not at liberty to defy those orders.  \n\tIt is also significant that none of the applicants were able to advance any cogent reason what would have happened if such orders were disobeyed.  There seemed to be no sanction in place to have been an effective way to have cohersed the applicants to have acted as they did. \n\tWe heard from Mr Tanda that if one smoked dagga for example, one would be stripped and made to roll in the dirt or the mud and the water but certainly there was no indication that if they had failed to carry out the attack which they did, that there would have been a type of court martial where they would have been severely reprimanded or corporally punished or anything in that vein.\n\tIt certainly seems from the evidence that those on the ground were left to their own devices.  Power, alias, sorry with the other Mzala and soforth, seemed to give a general indication of what the policy was.  Yet it appears from Mr Tanda's evidence and Mr Shiceka's evidence that the selection of the target was left up to themselves.\n\tMy argument in this regard is, despite the evidence that it was because african people were on the pavement that desisted or caused them to desist from attacking the restaurant.  \n\tMy submission is that on a proper analysis of that evidence it would clearly indicate that they had a discretion of whatever nature in order to effect the attacks as their mandate indicated.\n\tRegarding the question of proportionality, my submission is that the very nature of the means used and the nature of the target and what was to be achieved thereby, as I've addressed earlier, was disproportionate in the circumstances.\n\tMr Chairman, I also highlight the remark made by the Committee which appeared to be forthcoming from the evidence of Mr Tanda, that if the target was selected purely because the people were white then, with submission, that seems to have been the motivation which was based on racial lines.  \n\tAnd if one then accepts Mr Shiceka's evidence as it is supported by Mr Tanda, that the restaurant was avoided because black people may have been injured, then the only inference that can be drawn was that white people were attacked purely because they were white people and for no other reason.",

            "Mr Chairman, yes just on the racial aspect.  I want to advance three reasons why it should not be held, certainly not against the applicants, that they - or found rather that they had committed a purely racist act.\n\tFirstly, the applicants, on the uncontested evidence were foot soldiers carrying out orders, that is not disputed.  They were not part of the APLA hierarchy or high command which it is well established made the policy decisions and decided on matters of strategy.  For the same reason that Brian Mitchell or Coetzee or any other ex-South African defence force soldier wasn't part of the inner ...[indistinct] of Botha's cabinet making decisions to pursue cross-border raids etc.\n\tSecondly, the struggle for liberation in this country inevitably had to have a racial dimension and the reason for that is quite simple and very glaring and we don't need evidence for that because the applicants lived through it.  \n\tBlack people in this country lived through it who were born here.  They were governed by whites, they were controlled by white, they were suppressed by whites and the overwhelming majority of the white electorate voted in the same government repeatedly by in fact increased majorities as we moved towards the April 1994 election.\n\tSo that was an inevitable part of the history of this country.  Now it's very important that our parliament a democratic elected parliament recognised this by making the cut-off date the 10th of May 1997.  It recognised, the law makers recognised that we were engaged in a racial struggle up to that point.  And the 14th of February falls within that cutt-off date.\n\tThen just thirdly, again on a parity of - because this is what this Committee must do, this is what the Commission as a whole must do is to be even-handed and to treat people in the same fashion.  The apartheid government targeted overwhelmingly black people.  Coetzee was told to get rid of Griffiths Xenge and he did so very effectively.\n\tGriffiths Xenge was a well-known human rights activist but he was a black civilian.  Brian Mitchell committed the trust feeds matter where he killed innocent black young men, woman and children, he slaughtered them.  Those were civilians and both of them got amnesty.",

They were also therefore seen by a logical extension as functionaries supporting the state.  Without them voting the government in who knows what would have happened.\n\tBut in any case, the point that I'm making, those considerations, do you just kill white people and so on, those considerations didn't feature for the applicants because they were not part of the decision making process they were soldiers and they carried out their orders.\n\tMr Chairman, then just on a few other matters.  I think I made the point that yes, there were negotiations on at the time.  If one must take this factor seriously, and with respect I say we can't, then the legislature would have made cutt-off point the time when we had the negotiations at CODESSA.  Then it would have been and I think maybe it was, I think earlier December 1993 but the Act was amended and it was extended to May 1994.  And that period covers the applicants more than adequately.  \n\tAnd in fact my learned friend made the point that even the PAC had by a majority decision decided to continue with the armed struggle, so it wasn't to be complete yet.\n\tThe issue of proportionality like all the other factors that are mentioned in sub-paragraph 23(a) to (f) is not on it's own decisive.  And clearly if we look at each case in isolation then I think this Committee would have difficulty in giving amnesty to anybody.  \n\tI mean how on earth could Coetzee's murder of Xenge or Mitchell's mistake where he kills 11 people, how could that possibly be proportionate to the end which is being sought i.e. to get rid, in Mitchell's case, to get rid of ANC, UDF activists.  And in Coetzee's case, to get rid of one functionary, a person who is alleged to have been a ...[indistinct] for the ANC.\n\tIt clearly must be seen in it's overall context, in the context of the struggle in this country.",

I didn't understand Advocate Prior's submission with regard to similar submissions made in the St James that not every act is a political act and not every - evoking a slogan doesn't mean that that's a political objective.  I think the evidence is very clear in this case.\n\tWith respect, it is very clear that these applicants, they are not what one can call ordinary criminals.  You've heard from them Mr Chairman and learned members of the Committee, how they articulated their position, where they found themselves in, where they come from, their background and why they joined the liberation movement. They clearly don't deserve to be locked up for committing what was purely a political act clearly on their evidence.\n\tThe Norgaard Principles which is referred to by my learned friend, the attacks on purely civilian targets are attacks of a purely political nature which justifies amnesty.  I'm sure that our law makers had regard to the Norgaard Principles but we have a process in this country which is unique and the Act is designed to cater for that uniqueness. \n\tThe law ...[indistinct] has recognised that lots and lots, hundreds and thousands of innocent people overwhelmingly black were caught up in the crossfire but to put the past behind us it was necessary to have an amnesty process. Civilians would be killed and they were killed and they were killed in this case.  \n\tMr Chairman and learned members of the Committee, unless there's any aspect you wish to raise with me, those are our submissions, thank you very much.\n\tMr Chairman, can I just raise one aspect which I raised at the previous hearing and that is your decision.  It concerns me and my clients who are not only the applicants but the PAC and those in the APLA High Command, that such a long time elapses and has already elapsed before the Committee makes a decision.  \tIt concerns us that it would appear that the Committee, not this Committee but the big Amnesty Committee, is waiting to hear all the evidence in all these matters.\n\tWith respect, I think that's irregular.  Like my learned friend says, each case depends on it's own facts and I can't see how if this is the intention that an applicant may have a credibility finding against him or her in some other or subsequent proceeding, that it would then influence the result in for example, this particular matter.\n\tI would accordingly urge this Committee to make a decision as soon as possible in this matter.  The applicants have been in jail now for almost five years.  Mr Molefu for example, who wasn't directly involved in the incident and was an accomplice is also sitting in jail for a long time.",

            "But it must be pointed out though that it's also a question of practicalities.  If you got only 12 members of the Amnesty Committee and an applicant has got 50 incidents in respect of which he could apply for amnesty, a difficulty may arise.  And this has been as a result of the attitude adopted by some of the applicants and I don't blame them for that, perhaps they are right in doing so.\n\tThey brought an application in respect of one incident and a particular combination of the Amnesty Committee heard that particular application and took a decision which was not favourable to the applicant.  And the next thing that same applicant comes again with another incident, in the meantime a decision had been given in respect of the first incident.  \n\tHe appears again before the same Amnesty Committee or slightly constituted, differently constituted Committee, he comes with the next application and he says: \"No, no amongst you there's somebody who sometimes turned down may application, I don't want you in this combination, let him go out.  And then that person or those two people get out of the Amnesty Committee because previously they turned him down.  And he's not through yet with his applications.  \n\tNext time we hear his third application, his fourth and his fifth, surely he's going to exhaust members of the Amnesty Committee.  Who is going to hear the balance of these matters in the end, after everyone of us have been asked to excuse themselves because they would have heard his applications one after the other.\n\tNow it's an over-simplification of the problem.  The solution may well be that when a person brings applications in instalments, we should reserve judgement until we have heard all his applications to avoid that kind of scenario.  Particularly if it is obvious that he has got a lot more applications to bring because the problem that I've explained to you may arise and force us to withhold the Judgement.
