I told the other young boys to blow the whistles and we blew the whistles.\n\tI started running downhill because I was afraid I was going to be injured.  They came downhill and they started shooting towards our direction.  We started running downwards and we happened to assemble and we became many in numbers.  They shot one person Behkani Mkune if I remember well, yes it was Behkani Mkune.  After shooting at us they started running because that's how they used to do, they used to attack and run away.  \n\tAfter their retreat we sat down and tried to discuss as to what we're going to do.

            "Bangi instructed us that or suggested that we should fight back and we all agreed with him.  We used to be armed in most cases.  We waited for some time and at about 5, because it looked as if it was going to rain and it was winter, we decided to cross and go towards their direction  Tabudeni.\n\tWhen we arrived at Tabudeni at the grounds we sat there because we knew that most people who were staying in that particular place - because most of the people who were staying next to area on the downhill have already vacated the place and they were running away.  We were about seventeen.   While we were still hiding somewhere there, one boy from the Dlamini family came out of the house - we could see because there was some moonlight and we could see that there was someone standing there and we started running towards that Dlamini place and we surrounded the house.  The boy ran away after one shot was fired.  \n\tI was thinking that the house was used as a camp because I heard some gunshots and people with me were shooting, myself I was holding a spear and some bolts.  I didn't manage to get into the house.  We were all competing to get in an attack.  When others got in I heard some women shouting from within the house and I got so afraid when I discovered that there were women inside the house.  I never intended to attack women.\n\tAfter these people were injured we continued with our journey.  We continued - I thought we attacked women and men or men only but when arrived in court I found that we also attacked women.  We went to another family which I couldn't identify - we found three young boys in the house.  We attacked and stabbed them in the house, we stabbed them.  \n\tI went outside and saw it through the window because some didn't die instantly - we wanted to kill them because we knew that these were the people who were attacking us.  Others might have ran away after hearing some gun sounds below.  After killing these three we passed to another family and we find women, there was a woman and her children.  I told the other comrades that they shouldn't kill the women because they've already killed some and I was warning them that they shouldn't kill them and therefore we have to leave the women in that particular house so we divided and the others had to go via another bush and we took the other way.\n\tWe happened to meet the women who were running away.  After seeing us they started running.  I was in front and I heard the women crying.  It looks as if they were attacked.  I had to run back and go back and tell them that they mustn't attack them because it looked as though those were the people who passed and decided not to attack.  That's where one child was attacked.\n\tI told them that they shouldn't kill the women and the children because the people who we were targeting were ANC young men, whom we intended to go and attack.  We're not killing women, we're killing young men.  I intended to kill these ANC young men, members because those were the people who were attacking us.  \t\n\tWe took the young child to another family.  I don't know to whom the family belonged but we left the child there and we continued to a place called Ndaleni.  We arrived at ...(inaudible) Sadam.  We were going by to check whether there were some other IFP members.  Sadam told me that we should go up to Kwambonga's  place as maybe the people might be meeting there.\n\tThey said Kwambonga, I didn't know the place so we continued, we went to some ...(inaudible) and we surrounded the house.  When we listened through the windows, we could hear some people inside who were laughing.  I suspected that they were happy because they think they have attacked us and killed us.  We started to - we hit the door  - there was a ..(indistinct) in the door and we used it to hack the door.  The door opened and we shot at the people and we also stabbed them with the spears and the bolts - one of them died instantly next to the rondawel.  That was the person who had these multiple stab wounds because he was stabbed by most of the people.\n\tSome of the people died right inside the house, some managed to jump out through the windows and run away.  After that we thought we killed all of them.  After some time we left them and continued to Mtusi's place because we ran out of ammunition.  Mtusi was one of our IFP member at Ndalene and we went to him to ask for ammunition.  He gave us eight.",

However, they shot that person and we, after that we left the place.  On our way we met two people and Gumbi shot them.  He shot at them because he thought they were coming to find out as to what's happening hearing the gunshots.  I don't know whether he killed them or not.\n\tWe continued to a place called Matafeni.   When we arrived at Matafeni we entered at the first homestead, it was a new homestead.  We asked the mother in the house and she told us that she's coming from a particular place and we discovered that it was only the woman and there was nobody in the house, so we left to pass that family an we continued.\n\tI was insisting to them that they shouldn't kill women on our way because I intended that we should fight the ANC's young comrades.  However, most of the people with us they said, we have to kill all of them because we also lost our mothers in the war so whoever we find on the way, even the children, we have to kill them.\n\tI realised that there was nothing that I was going to do because if I continued to disagree with them, they were turn against me and kill me so I kept quiet and kept on watching all the incidents, whatever, all the things they were doing.

Whatever, I don't like the fact that they're lying to say that they didn't know or didn't see that there were women inside the house when they were attacking and that there was no light in the house.  There was light in the house and there was a moonlight so I would say that they are lying to say that they couldn't see that there were women in the house.  To say they ask for amnesty because what they did was a mistake, it wasn't what they intended and to say that they were following their leaders - we do agree with the granting of amnesty if that is the case.  However what I don't like is that they're lying to say that they didn't see our younger sisters or didn't recognise that they were women.",
