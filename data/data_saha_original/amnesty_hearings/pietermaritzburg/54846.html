<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mpshe, the application, sorry.  For the record, this is a sitting of the Amnesty Committee to hear the applications of Mr S W Motaung, Mr N G Sibisi, Mr J M Sithole and Mr B P Dlamini.  The Committee consists of myself, Andrew Wilson, of Mrs Sisi Khampepe and Mr Denzil Potgieter.  Gentlemen, will you please put yourselves on record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, committee members.  My name is John Wills.  I represent all applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Mr Chairman, committee members, my name is</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>Colas Miranda.  I represent the victim's family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, members of the committee, J M Mpshe representing the TRC, particularly the Amnesty Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mpshe, I see that there are, there is application for four persons set down before us today, but that there are only three people present.  Could you perhaps explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, that is so.  The fourth person, B P Dlamini, is today not present due to the information that he may have received yesterday that the police, the SAPS, want him, they want to arrest him.  I can put it on record that they were here yesterday.  I had a talk with them in the afternoon and informed them that they have got to be here today to connect with the legal representative of Dlamini.  That is the reason why he is not here, I believe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it would appear his absence is not exactly voluntary.  Subject to what anyone may have to say, it seems to me that in those circumstances one should adjourn his application, but that it may not be necessary to have a separate hearing in the event of a decision being arrived at with the other three.  It may well be subject to anything his representatives may have to say.  It is possible to make a similar order in respect of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I am respectfully in agreement with that position.  I confirm what Advocate Mpshe has indicated, it does appear from the information I have received from the other applicants, that the reason for the failure of the fourth applicant to appear today is that he was threatened with arrest at this hearing, but as regards the adjournment of the application, I confirm that I, from his point of view it is in his interest and I would submit that that is in order.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does anyone else wish to say anything in regard to the question of adjourning the application of Dlamini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Mr Chairman, committee members, the opinion of my clients, the victim's family, is that they would like this matter finalised today.  So, they have no objection to this matter being adjourned and they have no objection to abiding by the decision of the committee in relation to these three also being implemented to the fourth person who is not here today.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> I will then, Mr Chairman, hand over to my learned friend, Mr John Wills, to lead the first applicant.  I believe it will be Motaung.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairman, may they be sworn in?  Mr Motaung.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Motaung.  Your full names please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Sipho W Motaung</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">SIPHO W MOTAUNG:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> The witness has been sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>EXAMINATION BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, committee members.  Mr Motaung, you are applying for amnesty in respect of what matters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> It is in connection with a murder and also escape, escaping from prison after the case was concluded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Excuse me, if you could just bear me with Mr Chairman.  I am just trying to get this apparatus working.  Mr Motaung, you made an affidavit in support of an amnesty application in regard to these matters on the 3rd of December 1996.  Do you confirm the contents of that affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is the affidavit which is at page ten of the record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.  Mr Motaung, can you tell me about how you got involved with the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I joined the ANC, because I was not satisfied by the former Government's policies.  The regime at that, time it was a regime which oppressed the people.  For example, I use to see police terrorising the people or harassing the people and it was so difficult for us to bear this.  Sometimes the police will harass us.  They even harassed my father.  MR WILLS:  What was your father's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> It is Walter Motaung.  He was Walter Motaung.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is it correct that you eventually joined Umkhonto we Sizwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct, I joined the ANC's armed wing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Can you tell the committee the circumstances leading up to you joining Umkhonto we Sizwe and a little bit about the training you received in relation thereto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I joined the ANC's armed wing in 1984 and I went to exile.  I came back to work underground in South Africa operating the guerilla warfare.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did you receive training inside or outside the country in regard to this period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I got training outside the country.  I went to Swaziland, Zambia, Tanzania.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> How did you cross the South African borders in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I skipped through the Pongola, I crossed the Pongola River.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do I take it that you did not, in fact, go through a formal customs post?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.  I did not skip the country, I did not get out of the country lawfully.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> When you returned to South Africa after having been trained, you have mentioned that there were certain people who were in the organisation that you worked with.  Can you give the committee the names of these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> The person that I met was Rita, Mandla and Sipho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you know the full names of these people and, if so, please give the committee the details thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I have a problem, because the two of them, Rita and Mandla, I only know them by their names.  I do not know their surnames.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what about Sipho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> He was Sipho Maloko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is that spelt M O L O K O?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> It is Maloko, M A L O K O.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> These people, were they, how did they fit into the structures?  Were they senior to you or junior to you or were they just ordinary members of the ANC or were they members of the, were they also members of Umkhonto we Sizwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> They were MK members and they were seniors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> At any stage, did you conduct the training in respect of any other persons in, did you train any other persons in respect of military activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Please may you repeat your question.  Please may you repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> At any stage did you, were you involved in the training of other persons in regard to military matters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Can you give ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wills, I do not want to interfere in any way with the leading of evidence, but looking at the affidavit it appears there is a three year period that we have jumped, that this took place not on his, as I understand the affidavit, not on his return to the country, but after he came out of prison in 1988, if you look at paragraph 12.  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So we now talk about 1988, not his earlier return?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do not think you need to go into it, because it sets out fully in the affidavit, but just to get the record straight that we have jumped three years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Alright, Mr Motaung, I want to concentrate now on the first crime in respect of which you are applying for amnesty and that is the murder of Lolo Lombo on the 31st of October 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> May you please repeat the question for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No, it is not a question.  I am just telling you now that I am wanting to concentrate, in the next few minutes, on the actual murder of Lolo Lombo in October 1990.  Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> What would you like me to explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Okay, if you could just tell the committee, in as much detail as you can remember, what your involvement was in that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Okay.  My involvement in that particular case, Mandla and Rita came to me and they told me that there is a mission which has to be carried out and I accompanied them.  They first pointed the person to me and then I went to Sibisi Nhlanhla.  I asked him to be involved in the mission.  Therefore, we left to carry out that mission.  We entered the Joshua Doore.  That is where we found him and we shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> The Nhlanhla you refer to is that Mr Sibisi, the second applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Were there, I want you go into a little bit more detail than that.  I want you to tell the committee exactly what happened prior to the incident occurring, the planning that was made, the way that you were transported to and from the scene up to the point of your arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is any of this in dispute?  I am asking the other, not you.  Mr Mpshe, do you dispute any of this version as set out in the affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> No, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you would not object to Mr Wills leading his witness on these points?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is on the factual aspect, not, there maybe some dispute as to precisely what each person was responsible for, but the fact of how they travelled and things of that nature ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... you are not disputing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is it correct that prior to this operation Rita and Mandla came to your home and that they told you that they wanted this particular person, Arnold Lolo Lombo, assassinated as he was an IFP warlord?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.  He was an IFP member and he was also considered a warlord who had killed a lot of ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is it correct that together with Rita and Mandla on the 30th of October you went to Sibisi's house, picked him up and then you met other people at Henley Dan just outside of Edendale?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, that is correct.  That is what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Who gave you the firearms in order to conduct the mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> We got the arms from Mandla.  There were two 9mm.  One was given to me and the other one to Sibisi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you remember getting into a combi and being driven by two other persons into town in order to conduct the mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you remember who was driving the car and who the other person in the car was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> It was Johnny Sithole and Kokleese Dlamini.  Phineus, I mean Phineus Dlamini.  I only knew their name after we arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Right, those two persons you have, obviously, come to know subsequent to this.  Those are the third and the fourth applicants in respect of this matter.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, they drove you down to town and you indicated that it was just you and Mr Sibisi who actually carried out the hit.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Can you tell the committee who actually shot Mr Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> It is Nhlanhla Sibisi, shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you know how many shots were used in this hit, how many shots were fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> One shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did you know from what range the shot was fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> It was at point blank range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> From the evidence you have given it appears to me clearly that you were in common purpose with Mr Sibisi to conduct this hit.  You also wanted to kill Mr Lombo, in other words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You then ran out the shot and shortly thereafter the four of you were arrested in a combi outside of the Alexandria Road Police Station.  Is that correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, do you know why Mr Lombo was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Can you tell the committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I would say that he killed a lot of ANC members and he harassed a lot of people and he was always in company of the police.  We thought maybe he had licence to kill the way he use to kill people.  That is the reason why we quickly decided that we should eliminate him and we thought that was a right thing to do, to eliminate him, because he was harassing the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say "harassing the community" do you mean everybody in the community or was he harassing the ANC people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I am referring particularly to the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You were then arrested and held in custody for some time, having been refused bail.  You then escaped from custody.  Can you give the committee the details as regards to this escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> In prison I use to have visitors, people like Mandla.  One of those days I discussed with them.  It was clear that we are not going to get bail.  We did not get bail.  Therefore, I personally planned, I decided that I shall break my finger so that they can take me to hospital.  I knew that they do not have bone doctors in prison.  I knew when I broke my finger they will take me to hospital outside.  That happened.  It so happened that I call Mandla before, the day before I was to be taken to hospital.  I broke my finger.  We needed to have a password, LOD, that is life or dead.  I knew that someone was coming to pick me up. We also arranged for transport and if someone had to come and collect me they have to use the password.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>	When I arrive at Eden Hospital, I asked to enter the toilet.  I entered the toilet.  When I got out of the toilet I pushed one of the police aside and he fall and I started running.  I got into the car.  After someone have passed using the very same password that I knew, I got into that car and we ran away in the car.  They took me to J Section at Mbali.  That is where I stayed the night and I went to Durban in one of the ANC members home.  Therefore, after that our regiments were met that I should go to Chesterville.  That is where I found Sibisi and other comrades.  I stayed there.  Later I left with some cadres, three of them, those whom I found at Chesterville.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>	They left us at the border where we had to cross.  They were given money for food.  We were told that we have to get some transport to Mazanie in Swaziland.  We went to Mbabane and they took us to some houses where they accommodate refugees.  After that they took us to Matsape Airport and we flew to Zambia.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did you later end up in the ANC Mgagao military base in Aringa region, Tanzania?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> May you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did you later end up at the ANC military base, Mgagao, that is M G A G A O, in Aringa region in Tanzania?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, that is where I ended up, Aringa region in Tanzania.  That is where I was trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And I take it that you continued with your military training at this place and returned to South Africa after the democratic elections in April 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You were then integrated into the South African National Defence Force and you remained there until your arrest in respect of this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Just, what rank did you have when you were in the Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I was a Lieutenant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, at the time you made this application, at the time you made this application you were in custody.  Is that not so and you later secured the bail and you are now out on bail in respect of these charges?  Is that correct</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now that the elections have come, how do you feel about the death of Mr Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I will say that what happened, have happened.  However, I would like to say that I would like to ask forgiveness from his family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, committee members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Motaung, who was in charge of this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Mandla was in charge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Before you could go out with the other three was there any meeting held by your organisation to discuss and plan this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I think Mandla, as a Commander, he might have discussed the operation with other people whom I do not know.  It was that it was an underground operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Were you not one of the leaders in the area at the time?  If I remember in your affidavit you stated that you would bring people to train and you even put some of them under your command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now can you explain why you could, why you were not involved or summoned by Mandla to that meeting wherein this whole thing was being planned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I would say I just took an order which was given to me, because I thought they have thoroughly discussed the issue.  I just only took the order from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> You mean you took the order to take the life of a human being just on what you thought could have been done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, that is correct.  The way they have explained to me, I thought there is a valid reason to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> What was Mandla's actual position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> He was a Commander.  I am not sure exactly, but he was a trained Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, who was the local Chair of the ANC in that area at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I do not remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Had you ever attended an ANC meeting in the area before the carrying out of this operation, as a Commander that is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, I use to attend meetings, the Youth League meetings and the meetings for the organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, who was the Chair at those meetings?  Who was chairing those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> It was Lamon Ngabie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> This area where, this area of Edendale, did you live in that area yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I was born in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Did you know the deceased, Lombo, yourself, personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I only knew him after he was pointed to me during the carrying out of the mission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, I am going to refer to your affidavit, a certain portion of your affidavit, page 15 of the papers, paragraph 19 thereof, the second line.  I will read for convenience of the witness.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>"On 27th October 1990 Rita and Mandla came to my home and informed me that they wanted me to carry out a mission.  They told me that there was an IFP warlord by the name of Arnold Lolo Lombo who was active against the ANC.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, you were told by these people and you went out and carried out this operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, I was told and they first went to point the person to me and I saw the person on that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Are you telling this committee that on what you were told, without yourself, as a Commander, ascertaining the facts and whether it is actually this person was what he was said to be, you went out and killed him, on hearsay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, I just took what they told me, because I trusted them.  I knew that they will not tell me some trivial stories.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> In your evidence, further, you testified to the effect that Lombo had killed many, a lot of ANC members.  He thought he had a licence to kill, he was harassing the community.  Can you tell us the people that he may have killed that you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I knew two people whom he killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Who are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> One of them is Bongani, Bongani Bopela.  The other one was Themba who died there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> And these, I believe, you were also told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, I was told by people who were present at that, at the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, the people you first mentioned, Rita, Mandla and Sipho Maloko, what are they doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Sipho Maloko has been killed by the gangsters in the security forces.  He has passed away.  Rita and Mandla, I have last seen them long ago.  I do not know where they are.  I last saw them when coming back from exile, 1994.  1995, I am sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, you went out to carry out this operation.  By killing Lombo, in your own mind, what did you seek to achieve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I did not have anything in mind to achieve.  However, I intended to kill him, because if we went, when we went to the police to report issues which might have occurred to the ANC people, police did not take that into mind.  So, I thought it is proper and justifiable to kill him, because the police could not do their job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Do I hear you to be saying that you killed him in order to make the police respond to your reports to them? What I am driving at, what was the reason of killing him?  What was behind all this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> It was because he harassed a lot of ANC people, he killed a lot of them.  So, we decided we shall remove him, eliminate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Had complaints been laid with the police about his behaviour, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, a lot of people have given reports to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did anything happen as a result of those reports?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Nothing happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Was any report being made to the higher authorities of the police about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I did not do it personally, but Mandla told me other people have given a report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> No further questions, Mr Chairman.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADVOCATE MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Miranda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MIRANDA</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> These people that informed you about Lombo's attacks on ANC members, exactly what did they say to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> They told me he is a warlord. Most of the time people were forced to join Inkatha and those who were not Inkatha members will be beaten.  Since I was not staying over the hill or above, so I heard it from other people telling me about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> What did they tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Mandla use to give, brief me about the situation, because he use to stay at that area.  So, he use to come and tell us about what is happening and also the activities of this man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Was Lombo, sorry Mr Chairperson.  Was Lombo, when he was shot, was he facing you and talking to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.  I got into the store and took him out.  I told him I was investigating a particular case and that I was a policeman.  I told Sibisi that when I open the docket, Sibisi shall shot him and we have to make sure that when he got shot, nobody, no bystanders will be shot at and that is what happened, with one bullet and he fall on the ground and we left the scene in a hurry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> How far away were you, how far?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> We were so close, as I said, he shot him point blank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> And what injuries did he sustain that you could see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> We did not have time to see what might have happened, because we were in a hurry to escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> And when Sibisi shot Lombo, was Sibisi standing behind Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Why talking to him holding the docket, Sibisi came from my back.  I told Sibisi that when I open the docket, the person, while the person is looking at the docket he shall shot at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Was Sibisi behind you or behind Mr Lombo when he shot Mr Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> He was between me and Mr Lombo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> So, when Mr Sibisi fired the shot he could see, Lombo could see what was going to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> He did not see that we were shooting at him.  That is how I perceive it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> And do you know why Dlamini was asked to come with you in the combi to Joshua Doore?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> The reason behind that was that they had to transport us to town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> The other thing that you mentioned in your affidavit is that when you left Joshua Doore, just after killing Lombo, shots were fired at yourselves.  Who fired these shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Sibisi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Who did he shoot at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> He was shooting at Lombo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> So, how many times did Sibisi shoot Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> But, let me just go back to what I stated earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> May I just interrupt you, Mr Miranda, because I am a little confused.  I think we have here at paragraph 23, I do not know whether you were referring to that, but who fired shot as they were living the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Yes, I am referring to paragraph 23.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I just want to ask Mr Motaung in that regard.  In your affidavit you have stated that "other persons" and I would like to assume, and I need your correction in that regard, that by "other persons" you mean people other than Mr Dlamini and those who were in and Mr Sibisi.  The "other persons" that you have referred to in this paragraph would be people other than Mr Dlamini and Mr Sibisi?  Is that not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> May you please repeat the question.  I did not get it very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> In your affidavit you have stated that when you were leaving Joshua Doore after Mr Lombo had been shot by Mr Sibisi, "other persons" fired shots at you and Mr Sibisi and that is why you had to change your plan, but Mr Miranda has put a question to you and that question was, who fired the shots at you when you were leaving the shop and you said it was Mr Sibisi and Mr Dlamini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> We just heard shots fired.  We thought maybe it was just people around there who were shooting.  We do not know whether they were police or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Thank you.  If the plan was that you would escape in the VW Golf, why was the combi still hanging around in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> We ran into the combi and escaped.  We used the combi.  At Berger Street we jumped into the combi after the operation and left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Where was the VW Golf when this incident occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> It was parked in one of the parking areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Was this parking area the area where customers can park to shop at Joshua Doore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> And who was in the VW Golf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> It was Rita and Mandla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> And if I understand your evidence correctly, the combi was parked in Berger Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> So, if you were in trouble, why did you not jump into the VW Jetta, VW Golf if it was parked just outside Joshua Doore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> It was a bit far.  So we decided that people should not see where we have hid the car which we will use as a runaway car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Would you have applied for amnesty if you were not recharged for this offence by the Criminal Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, I would have asked for amnesty, because I need to ask for amnesty even if they did not charge me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> No further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MIRANDA</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, with your permission, I just want to clarify something with the witness, with the Chairs permission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just to clarify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Motaung, when you were asked about the position inside the shop, I recollect you responded that Sibisi was between yourself and Lombo.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, I said he was between me and Lombo at the time when we shot him, but we were not standing direct on a straight line.  He was, he came from behind me and shot at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, how were you standing or how were you walking or standing in relation to Sibisi, I mean to Lombo?  Were you walking behind him or side by side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> I was on the other side of Lombo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> And Sibisi came from behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Yes, he came from behind and that is when I started opening the docket or file and when he started looking at the docket, Sibisi shot at him.  That is what we discussed.  I told him as soon as he looks at the docket he should shoot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said Sibisi came from behind.  Did he come from behind you or from behind Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTAUNG:</span> Behind Lombo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Then I am covered.</p>

<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> As I understand it Mr Lombo was shot in the back of the head by Sibisi.  Is that what you recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That does not accord with the post mortem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well, sorry, I was a bit vague, Mr Chairperson, my understanding of the post mortem is the top of the neck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you look at page 79, the bullet passed forward, slightly downward ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The bullet passed forward and slightly down through wound number one which was the wound on the lower lip, between the base of the skull and cervical one vertebrae, fractured cervical one vertebrae, lacerated the spinal cord and exited on wound number two, which is the wound in the right lower occiput.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, I withdraw that question, Mr Chairperson.  I am sorry.  Last question, Mr Motaung.  Dlamini and Sithole, they were waiting in the combi.  Is that correct?</p>
