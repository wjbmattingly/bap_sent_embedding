<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, the matter of Mthembui, which is a part-heard matter before this Committee, my information this morning was that Mr Mthembui was arrested in Eshowe District on Thursday last by members of the Murder and Robbery Squad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	We have been unable in this short space of time to find out exactly where he is, it is unlikely that he would be here today.  In the circumstances of the matter, I would ask that the matter simply be adjourned in absentia for a date to be arranged with his representative.  Mr Wills unfortunately was here, he left to go back to his office and won't be able to get back to the hearing within the next 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He is aware of this act that is going to be adjourned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> We've sent a message to him, to his office, that it will be adjourned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The next matter?  This matter will be adjourned in absentia to a date to be arranged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  The next matter is the part-heard matter of Gumbi and Zuma.  All the parties are present and Ms Judith Dlamini is present to be cross-examined.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">JUDITH DLAMINI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr De Klerk, at the last hearing you requested an adjournment for you to look at certain documents and to decide whether you wanted to ask any more questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>	I am told you have a few questions to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DE KLERK:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.   Ma'am, I just want to get clarity.  Is it correct that you also testified during the criminal trial which the applicants were convicted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> Will you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Can you just tell me, is it correct that you testified during the criminal trial where the applicants were originally convicted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The witness doesn't seem to hear anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you hear that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> I would like the question to be repeated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I will repeat the question.  Is it correct that you testified during the criminal trial where the applicants were convicted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> The reason why I am asking, it seems according to the record that I received from the High Court register, that the person that testified during that trial's names are the following:  Excuse me Your Worship, Zokhile Judith Dlamini.  Is that you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> You testified previously in this matter that you saw a van, it seems that you saw a police van and that there were camouflage clad occupants, is that correct, in that van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Why did you mention that during this application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> I mentioned that because I saw the van which used to come by taking people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Do you agree with me that is an important event that happened that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Just to clarity before I ask my next question.  What did this van do, what did the people do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> I used to see the van passing by and some people will get into the van and that is all that I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Who climbed into the van?  I am going to ask this straight forward, did this van assist the attackers in any way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> I didn't see people getting into the van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> You did see people getting into the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> I didn't say it that way, I didn't say I saw people climbing into the van.  After my mother was injured, a van used to come by to carry people.  My mother asked me to stop the van so that they could help her, but I said I can't stop the van because it is used by police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>	Nobody climbed into the car, I didn't see anybody climbing into the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Was this after the attack or before the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> It happened after the attack, after my mother was injured.  And this car passed and she asked me to stop the car so that she could be helped, to take her to hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>	I said to her I can't stop the car, because I know this van, it is a police van.  Those were the camouflage police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> The reason why I am asking you, if this is such an important event that you deem it necessary to explain to this Commission, why didn't you explain to the criminal court, the High Court, these facts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>	Because out of the record, there is no mention in your evidence during that trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't it more important for a victim to explain what happened to her mother who was killed in the attack, what was done than it is for a witness in a criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Maybe the witness can explain that to me, Mr Commissioner.  Is it possible that you can just say why didn't you mention this at the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> Isn't it now you want the truth?  At this present moment I am telling you the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes, and during the criminal trial, did you tell the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS DLAMINI:</span> Will you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes, all I want to know is just explain why didn't you say it at the criminal trial, that is all?  If it wasn't asked from you or you didn't deem it necessary, you can just explain it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If it wasn't asked from her, she wouldn't have said it.  She is being led at a criminal trial isn't she Mr De Klerk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I will not take that point further Mr Commissioner.  I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DE KLERK:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR RETHMAN:</span> I have no questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR RETHMAN:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> No questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does that conclude the evidence in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR RETHMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am afraid I can stay no longer, I should have been in hospital 20 minutes ago.  I will ask parties to submit written argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>	That concludes today's hearing, we will now adjourn until ten o'clock tomorrow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, the position is that the new matter was scheduled for Wednesday.  I have communicated with Mr Arendse who will be consulting with the applicants tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>	It is prepared, as soon as he had concluded that consultation, to then proceed with the matter, so we hope to try and get it on by tea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I was thinking to indicate to spectators who may wish to have come.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It will not be before ten o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">COMMISSION ADJOURNS:</span> .</p>
