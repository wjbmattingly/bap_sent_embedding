<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am sorry that we are late in starting this morning.  We were told that the victims had not arrived.  We were subsequently told that some of the victims had arrived, but that others, including their leader, was on their way, were on their way here.  There was also some confusion as to whether they wish to be legally represented and had made arrangements to that effect.  Can anyone tell me whether the victims who intend to be present are, in fact, present here today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, I am told only two is present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> They have not got their headphones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I will repeat what I said in chambers, that two is here and the two that is here informed us that the rest will be coming with their leader.  The arrangement was that their leader will meet all of them here.  So these came before the others could arrive, but they are on their way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The trouble is that the notification that was given, as I understand it, was that the hearing would commence at nine o' clock.  It is now a quarter to, 20 minutes to 11.  There seems to be no certainty that this leader or the others are, in fact, going to be here.  They have made no attempt, as far as I know, to communicate with anyone responsible for the organisation of this hearing, to explain that they have been delayed.  Do you know where they were coming from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> They come from Richmond.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, that is, what, 40km, 50km from here.  If there had been a breakdown they would certainly have been able to get alternative transport by now.  It seems to me, subject to what anyone may have to say, that we should commence this hearing.  I see nods from the legal representative of the applicants and from the leader of evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I am ready to proceed Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If they arrive later we will adjourn for a short while while an explanation can be given to them of the evidence that has been led.  Very well.  Could you, where is the lady, she is disappearing again.  The lady who spoke to you, Mr Mpshe.  Could you ask her to please ask the two victims who are here if they heard and understood what I said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Yes, Sir, they said they did understand everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And are they happy with that arrangement, they appear to be.  Could you interpret to, I see he has got his head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Your Honour, they say there were nine victims, so there are nine families.  They could say you can go on with your proceedings, but then they do not know how the other seven families will feel about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will continue.  Before we do, Mr Mpshe, have you gotten a translation of pages 35 to 37?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, there is no translation.  This I discovered last night when I read this ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I raised this last Friday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Yes, and it was said that the translation will be forwarded.  I did phone Cape Town to check whether is had been forwarded and the person who was to assist in this, I am told, she is ill, she is not in the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But this is a statement, as I understand it, in Zulu which we could have surely had interpreted in 20 minutes here in the town.  If we had asked the assistance of those sitting behind you I am sure one or other of them could have helped you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can arrangements be made, because one of the members of the committee has had the benefit of reading this letter, addressed to the Committee of Amnesty and she informs me that it is extremely relevant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> It is relevant Mr Chairman, I read it as well.  An arrangement can be made with the people behind, they can  in the meantime ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because I ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> ... for a translation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... do not blame Mr Wills at all, because he and I, I think, both understood from, someone other than yourself, Mr Mpshe, that it would be translated and the translation would be available before the hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> So I was told, Chair. That was my information, but I will cause it to be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson, if I could intervene here.  I had raised that issue with the evidence leader prior to this hearing and the arrangement, as far as I was concerned, was at our pre-trial or pre-meeting, pre-hearing on Friday, that that would be done and, in fact, would be given to me at Monday lunch, on Monday lunch time together with certain other documents, but to date I have not received them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Mpshe, I think it is a cause for concern that we should be given documents which have not been translated and the document by Mr Nzimande, I think, is an important document which should have been translated.  There is no point in including documents when other members and also the applicant's legal representative will not be able to use that documents you have included in your bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A further problem is that I imagine Mr Nzimande is going to be giving evidence before us shortly and I would like to have read what he has, the representations he has made to us before I hear him giving evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> That is so Mr Chairman and Madam committee members, but I want to point this out, that the procedure the TRC office, Cape Town office has now changed.  I do not, I was not given the opportunity to check the documents.  I wanted to check everything myself to make sure that all is in order, but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, it is not your, Mr Mpshe, we had a pre-trial meeting on Friday to avoid precisely this sort of thing and an undertaking was given by another member of our staff who had prepared the papers, as I understand it, that arrangements would be made.  Mr Wills heard them and expected it to be done.  It is not your problem.  You have been up here leading evidence since we started and you also expected to be given this, but what, I wonder if we can get it, it is three pages, how long it would take to get that translated now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> I am told it would take about 15 minutes.  They have started with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, could we, perhaps, adjourn for 15 minutes and get that done so we are aware of what the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairperson, possible, with respect I could suggest that we could continue with the evidence of the first applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, before you do that, let us ask, I do not know whether the person who is going to do the translation is the person who will be engaged in interpretation for the hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> It is ten to 11.  We may as well adjourn and have tea and stuff at half past 11.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, not half past, he said 15 minutes.  Is it the same interpreter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Yes, it is the same interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand it is the same person.  So we will adjourn now for at least 15 minutes, perhaps a little longer, till this has been translated and made available.  Once again, I would like to apologise to members of the audience who have been sitting here patiently for a long time.  The problem that has arisen now is that one of the applicants, the second applicant, when he made his application he put up a three page letter setting out what his grounds were.  That was in Zulu and, unfortunately, we are not all conversant with Zulu and arrangements were made to have it interpreted, but there seems to have been some misunderstanding and it has not happened.  So we are going to do it now and we hope within 15 or 20 minutes that we will start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand that this was not a matter of a simple interpretation, but it required the co-operation of a number of people including the applicant, but I gather we are now satisfied with the version that has been put up and we should, perhaps, mark it 35A so that it can go into the bundle after the original.  I would like to thank those who assisted us.  Carry on then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  May I thank the Chair and the committee members for the time given in the, to effect that translation.  Just some few things that I want to say before we start with the applicants.  I want to refer the members of the committee to page 38 of the bundle.  Page 38 of the bundle.  On page 38 you will note, Mr Chairman, it is a report from the Investigative Unit and they indicate that there are three applicants, page 38 of the bundle, the last applicant being Tandukwazi Christopher Dlamini.  I just want to explain that he did apply and his application was sent back to him, because it was not properly filled up.  He did not respond and we served with another letter, reminding him that we still expect the application and that he needs to be enroled.  I have got copies of those letters from Cape Town office.  He did not respond.  The information that I got, which my learned friend will confirm, is that this man died a long time ago in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Surprising that the Prisons Department did not notify you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Kept like that and then moving to page 47 of the bundle.  Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before we, I am reminded, we have not complied with the formality.  So before we continue can I say this is the, Wednesday the 30th of July.  The application of Mandlenkosi T Poswa and Mafoeka Anthony Nzimande.  I, Andrew Wilson, am acting as Chairman together with Mrs Khampepe and Mr Potgieter.  Would you two gentlemen please put yourselves on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> My name is John Wills, I am an attorney representing both applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> J M Mpshe for the Truth Commission, particularly Amnesty Committee.  Thank you Mr Chairman, members of the committee.  Page 47 of the bundle.  My Chairman, you will note when reading the court record, the transcript that I gave to the members the other day and when looking at page 47 the name of the Nzimande does not appear on the list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He is number six is he not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> I just wanted to note that he is number six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Thank you.  I then hand over to my learned friend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.  Mr Chairperson, committee members I call the first applicant, M T Poswa, to give evidence.</p>

<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.  Now, why did you join the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I liked the organisation, because it was fighting for human rights and also for liberation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, I know Indaba Zimboeza Poswa.  He is a very high profile IFP member at Gengeshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> When you say high profile could you just explain to the committee what you mean.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> He was the leader at Gengeshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And by that you mean the IFP leader at Gengeshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you know if he did anything to any ANC members in Gengeshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Can you explain to the committee please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Indaba Zimboeza Poswa did not like ANC members.  He wanted IFP to be the only party at Gengeshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, in respect of the incident for which you have been convicted, and I am specifically referring to the incident which occurred on the 26th of September 1996, did you yourself get paid or get any personal gain for committing the deed that you committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I did not get anything out of it or benefitted out of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, I want you to tell us about the period prior to the incident in 1992.  I want you to tell us how the violence started and what actually occurred and I am specifically am not asking you about the incident on the 26th of September, I am asking you about the period prior to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> The violence started in 1991.  ANC members were being shot.  Mantutu was one of the people who got shot. This was Mantutu Poswa at Strandkloof in Pinetown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Poswa, Mr Poswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Poswa, we would like you to slow your pace, because we have interpreters who have to interpret what you say to English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Give us that name again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> The name given, as I understand it, Mr Chairperson, was Mantutu Poswa and I have got it spelt</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>M A N T U T U, Mantutu Poswa.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From Pinetown did he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> He was, if I can just clear that up.  Sorry, what happened to Mantutu Poswa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I made a mistake, I will like to withdraw that statement about Mantutu Poswa.  He was not killed in 1991, he was killed in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Okay, let us try and start off at the beginning.  You have indicated that the violence started in 1991.  What happened in that year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> In 1991 Msolwa Basi was shot, but he did not die.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> If I can just clarify that Msolwa Basi, is that M S O L W A, Basi, B A S I?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, yes.  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And who, in your opinion, was responsible for shooting Msolwa Basi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> It was Namawakwe Gillie and Keswa Poswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> These two persons you have mentioned, what political organisation did they belong to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Msolwa was an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And the other two people, Namawakwe Gillie and Keswa Poswa?  What political organisation did they belong to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> May you please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You have indicated that two persons by the name of Namawakwe Gillie and Keswa Poswa were, in your view, responsible for the shooting at of Mantutu, sorry, of Msolwa Basi.  I want to know, those two people, Namawakwe Gillie and Keswa Poswa, what political organisation did they belong to.  If you know that please tell the committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Namawakwe Gillie is an IFP member, very active.  Keswa Poswa is an IFP member too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now this ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Wills, is it Keswa Poswa or Becker Poswa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I, my understanding of the evidence at this stage is that it is Keswa Poswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> It is Keswa Poswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Okay, now this Namawakwe Gillie, is he the same person who I referred to earlier who, in fact, is one of the deceased in the incident that occurred on the 26th of September?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.  He is Namawakwe, an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, okay, turning to 1992 now and the earlier part of 1992, were there any further acts of violence during that year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, in 1992 Spatelie, my son, was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Was your son a member of any organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, he was an ANC member and he was also a leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what was his role in the ANC, for the ANC in the Gengeshe community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> He was an activist who encouraged people to join the ANC at Gengeshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Your instructions to me were that, in fact, he was an ANC organiser.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And your ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How old was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> He died at 27.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> That incident occurred on the 12th of the fourth 1992.  Is that correct?  That is the 12th of April 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, I believe that the day before this killing, the police came to, the South African Police came to Gengeshe.  Can you tell the committee what they did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> After the son was shot, they came to take him to the mortuary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Poswa, please listen carefully, you have misunderstood my question.  I am talking about the day before, ie, the 11th of April 1994.  The day before your son was shot the police came to Gengeshe.  Can you tell the committee what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Police came on the 11th at home.  Those were soldiers.  They searched the home.  They were in, accompanied by Mr Matthyson, who is a farmer.  They searched the house and went away and on the next, the following day my son was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> When you say "the house", is that the house, are you referring, whose house are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> They searched the whole homestead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Your homestead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what were they searching for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> They were looking for arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did they find any arms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> They did not find anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the name of the farmer again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Please can you repeat the name of the farmer that was with the soldiers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> He is from Gengeshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What is his name?  You gave the name Matthyson, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Mr Matthyson, Kongolo, it is Kongolo in Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, did anything happen as a result of the death of your son, that attack involving the death of your son?  I mean, what did the community, and by that I refer to those people in the community who were allied to the ANC, what did they do at this time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> After my son was killed we all left Gengeshe and went to stay and Ndaleni.  We were, those were the ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what happened to the houses of those members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> The houses were burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you know who was involved in the attack on your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> My son was killed by Keswa Poswa.  He shot him with a firearm and he was in the company of Namawakwe, Becker Poswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Were there any other people involved whose names you do not remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> No, those were the only people that I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, as I understand your evidence, it is to the effect that the ANC members of the community left Gengeshe and went to Ndaleni and this is the township which is just on the perimeter of Richmond.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, can you tell the committee whether or not the police investigated this, the murder of your son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Police got the message, the case was reported, but they did not do anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, what steps did you take?  You have been chased away or you had left your homes, what steps did you take in order to attempt to go back to your homes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We went back to our houses on the 26th and we were attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No, I am referring to earlier incidents.  Did you take any steps prior to going back on the 26th to try and negotiate you returning to your homes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> My son was shot on the 12th.  On the 13th Armond Poswa and Vimba Poswa and Fana Poswa went to Gengeshe to try to find some peaceful settlement of the issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Wills, can we have those names again.  He is rattling and we cannot keep up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  Mr Poswa, thank you.  You must remember that this process is being translated and people are also taking notes.  So we want you to go more slowly when you are giving your evidence.  So, can you tell us the names of the people who went to Gengeshe to negotiate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Armond Poswa, Vimba Poswa, Fana Poswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, I am sorry, I might have misunderstood your evidence.  I just want to clear it up.  What did these people do?  Just tell me what these people did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> They wanted Indaba Zimboeza Poswa to try and call him to reconcile with me since they have killed my son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what happened thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> They did not reach any peaceful agreement and they chose they did not want any peace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, were any other steps taken to negotiate the problems there and, specifically, I refer to in regard to a Chief Dlamini Mbulwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> After that Timothy Poswa and Vincent Poswa and Armond Poswa, they went to the chief, Konsingdaba Dlamini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is that Timothy Poswa who is your father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, Timothy Poswa is my father and he is a Headman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And Vincent Poswa, who is your blood brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, Vincent Poswa is my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And they went to Chief Dlamini who resides in the Bulwa area and whose jurisdiction covers the Gengeshe area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, they went to Chief Dlamini at Bulwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And can you tell the committee whether or not that attempt was successful.  Did Chief Dlamini help, in other words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> He did not help.  They asked him to come and reconcile the people.  He did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, you referred to an incident earlier where you said you got confused in respect of Mantutu Poswa and you mentioned something about Pinetown.  Can you explain to the committee about what, when this happened and what occurred there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Which time are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You mentioned earlier something happened to Mantutu Poswa in Pinetown.  Can you tell the committee what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> The IFP members bought a car, I mean, referring to Becker Poswa and they went to shoot Mantutu at Grondskloof in Pinetown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And this Mantutu Poswa, what political party was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Mantutu Poswa is an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And this Becker, you mentioned Becker Poswa bought a car and they went to Pinetown in that car.  This Becker Poswa, is he one of the deceased in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, I want to refer to the actual attack on the 26th of or the actual incident, should I say, on the 26th of September 1992.  Can you tell the committee what happened in the couple of days before that attack occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> You mean before the 26th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  Did you receive a phone call from anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, Becker Poswa called me and told me that they are coming to attack us at Ndaleni and we are not going to see the Christmas of 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Sorry, I did not get the end of that answer.  I wonder if I could ask if the interpreter could repeat it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He said they are coming to attack them and they will not see the Christmas of 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And this Becker Poswa is the same person you referred to earlier as being a deceased and prior to that being a prominent IFP leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So, what was your response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I said they should come and I am also coming to their side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Okay, now it is common cause that on the 26th of September you arrived early in the morning at Gengeshe.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, how many people were with you and by that I refer to the people in your party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We were about 31 or 32.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And these were ANC members.  Is that correct?  MR POSWA:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And the second applicant, Mr Nzimande, was among that group.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Can you remember the names of any others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> It was myself, Mandlenkosi Poswa, Mafoeka Nzimande, Lolo Poswa, Fanake Poswa, Falane Imbona, Nandi Poswa, Tuffie Mshengu.  I cannot remember the others and I did not know some of them.  MR WILLS:  Now, what were you going to do at Gengeshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We were ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, I think it is common cause that a number of you were armed on that occasion.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct, we were armed, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> ... heavily armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What were you armed with, personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I was holding a 303 firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And where did you get that firearm from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I bought it from Bovane at Nele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Sorry, can you slowly repeat that name for the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I bought it from Bovane Nele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> When did you buy it from Bovane Nele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> At the beginning of 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> As I understand it, this is prior to the violence starting in Gengeshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, this Bovane Nele is, in fact, the person whose, the deceased in count three of the incident.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct, he is one of the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You have referred to him as being an IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct, he was an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, as regards the other persons, can you just describe to the committee how they were armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> You mean the ANC people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I mean the ANC people, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> They were armed with firearms, others with spears and hunting or bush knives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Was everybody armed with a firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Not all were armed with firearms.  Few of them had firearms and others had spears and the bush, bush knives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, okay, it is common cause that you arrived at Gengeshe relatively early in the morning, I think before six a.m.  Can you tell the committee what happened soon after your arrival?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We arrived at Gengeshe.  We left the others at their homes below and we proceeded towards Umkumazi to my tuck-shop to see the damage, how it was damaged.  We came back going to one of my shop.  Before we reach that direction people started shooting at us, the IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And were the IFP members all separate or were they together, what was the position?  Were ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> They were near the family of Becker, just in front of Becker's family.  There were many just next to the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, my reading of the bundle here, it appears that they were in a camp on, from the evening prior to the incident until the morning when you arrived.  Do you understand what a camp is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, I know a camp.  They were at the camp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what do you understand by the meaning "camp"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> It is a place where people sit and wait for the war to start.  It is a waiting place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So, as I understand it, all of these IFP members were together when you first saw them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, they were waiting.  They were waiting ANC members.  MR WILLS:  Now, after this shooting started what did the ANC members do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> While we were going towards a direction along the road they shot at us.  We tried to protect ourselves by lying on the road.  They continued to shoot and they stopped.  When we tried to stand up they shot one of an ANC member, Mr Mtolo.  He fall on the ground and we started leaving the road and we went, moved towards their direction after one of us was shot and we started shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, this Mr Mtolo that you referred to, did he die in the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct, he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And then you retaliated, you indicated you retaliated.  You, yourself, were you responsible for killing anybody that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, we were lying on one of the fields and they shot at us and we returned fire and I shot someone.  MR WILLS:  And do you remember the name of the person you shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, it was Moentoe Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, committee members, I refer to the pages 84 and 89 of the bundle which is the post mortem report of that deceased.  Did you kill anybody else on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you remember who they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> It is only Moentoe Mkhize whom I realised I have shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And the others you are not sure of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now my understanding is, is that you had a, you used a 303 rifle on the day in question?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did you use any other weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I was only holding a 303 rifle.  That is the arm, the firearm that I used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, after this incident or how long would you estimate that this incident, how long did it take?  I mean, my understanding is, is that the fighting commenced at about six a.m. and when do you estimate that it was finished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We started at about past five, somewhere to six o' clock and it continued until six o' clock and the fight continued thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what happened after it had finished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We went back to Umkumazi and thereafter back to Ndaleni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And then shortly after that, in October, you were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct, I was arrested on the second of October 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, from my reading the bundle and the court record, it appears that there were, at the time of the, this incident, there were a number of women and children that were in the Gengeshe village at the time of the attack.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct, they were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did you, in any way, attack any of these women or children or you or members of your group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We did not wish to kill children and women, because we knew that they were not involved in the whole issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, I just want to refer to the general politics of Gengeshe at the time and immediately prior to that.  After you had left, after the ANC community had left in April 1992 after the death of your son, was it possible for an ANC member to reside in Gengeshe freely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> They could not stay there peacefully, because they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, what somebody who was not a member of a political party, somebody who was neutral, what would, would he be in a position to stay there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> They could also not stay there, because only the IFP members were allowed to stay in Gengeshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there any neutrals, were there anybody there, at that time, who were not either IFP or ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> There was only IFP and ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Sorry, on the day of the attack, the ANC people had, sorry, just immediately prior to the attack, the ANC people were not living there.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> May you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> My question is, is that, in fact, I will rephrase it.  From the 12th or from the day after your son's death, the ANC community had actually left Gengeshe.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, can you tell the committee why you took the action that you did on the 26th of September 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We went back to our homes and we did what we did, because we thought we had the right to come back to our place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, committee members, I have no further questions at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could I clear up something with you?  You have referred to your, on the day you went back you went to your tuck-shop.  Do you remember telling us that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what did you find when you got to your tuck-shop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> The tuck-shop was burnt down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you said then you came back and you were on your way to one of your shops.  How many shops did you use to own in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I had a shop and a tuck-shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what happened to your shop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We could not even reach the store or shop, but we knew that it was also burnt down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> The house was burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And is this how you use to make your living before you were forced out of the area, running shops there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And how old are you, please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I am 48 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did you have any alternative source of support?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> After my shops were burnt, I did not have anything to survive on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you lose anything, apart from your shops, do you have any cattle, anything of that nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I lost my shop and a tuck-shop, the house, my belongings, furniture and even the dogs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Everything you possessed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, everything that I had.  They took everything, even the corrugated iron.  They removed it above the roofs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>RE-EXAMINATION BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  Sorry, if I could just ask one question that I forgot to very briefly.  Mr Poswa, how many wives do you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I have three wives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And how many children do you support?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I have 19 children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There is one other point I wanted to enquire about, but I thought it might be easier to ask you, Mr Wills, to, you might be able to supply the answer as to where is this place, Gengeshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson, I can supply the answer.  It is approximately 16km from Richmond, travelling on the road towards, there is that famous little area just outside of Richmond, Burn Valley.  It is more or less, I would ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the way to Elandsklip?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I would not be able to answer that.  I think it is in that general direction, but I am not exactly sure in relation to Elandsklip where it is.  It is, I would estimate that Gengeshe, I have been there, it is I would say north-west of, slightly north-west of Richmond.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A long way from Bulwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> A fair, long way from Bulwa, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  We will now adjourn for half an hour.  We will start at half past one.  Is that alright with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> That is in order Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADVOCATE MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Poswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> You told us that when you were proceeding, going back to your place after you had inspected your tuck-shop, shots were fired and then you retaliated.  Are you in a position to tell us exactly what happened during the retaliation?  Whether it was only the shooting or it was the shooting and the destruction of property or what.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We shot them and they also shot at us and one of them by the name of Mkhize was shot and also some other people whom I have not seen, but I heard were shot and one of them was by the surname of Jama at Umkumazi and some of them whom I have not come close to.  Some of them were shot at, some of them were stabbed and there were about six.  We also burnt one of the cars that they used when they were going to kill ANC members in Pinetown and we also burnt it to ashes.  We also burnt one house, because some people ran into the house while we were shooting each other.  We burned the house asking them to come out.  When they came out we shot at them.  They managed to escape, because it was, there was smoke, we could not see them very well.  Unfortunately, they ran to a direction where they meet those who were on the lower part of the area and they also killed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, you testified that not all of you had firearms.  Others had ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.  We were not all arms, armed with firearms.  Others were armed with spears and hunting knives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Does it mean that at a particular stage the two groups came face to face physically fighting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, we did face each other and shot each other.  They shot at us and we shot at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Yes, but was there a stage where you came face to face in order to enable your people to use their assegais and to use the kirries that they had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We did not come that close, because they realised that the war was a bit difficult for them and they started running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Will I be correct to state that amongst those who died are those who were stabbed either with the assegais or hit with the kirries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, others were shot, others were stabbed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Which then would mean there was a physical contact to use umkhonto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> May you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Which would mean that there was physical contact in order to enable you to use the assegais?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, others managed to run to a closer position where they could stab a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, in your evidence earlier on you made mention of a camp.  These people whom you say were in a camp, were they attacked after they had left the camp or whilst they were still in their camp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We found them at the camp.  That is where we started shooting at each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Does it mean that you, sort of, ambushed them as they were sitting in their camp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> On the 26th, no we did not ambush them.  We were walking along the road.  They saw us coming.  So they were sleeping in one of the family, they got outside and took their firearms, started shooting at us and we lie down on the ground, on the road.  When we try to stand up they shot Ntolo and we retaliated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, all this incident, that is before the 26th, you testified that your son was killed, some of the members were killed, some of them were injured.  Were these incidents ever reported to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, we did report these incidents to the police, even the burning of houses in April 1992.  About 52 houses were burnt and we reported the matter to the police and we also opened cases on these particular instances, but police did not do anything.  They did not arrest anybody.  We knew who burnt the houses and we knew who were the leaders in the whole violence.  However, the police did not do anything about it, because police from Richmond were supporting the IFP and it was like they were brothers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now realising that the police at Richmond were supporting IFP, could you not have gone to another police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We did not have that information that if that is the case we have to go to another police station.  We only knew the only police station, that was the Richmond Police Station.  We did not know that we have the right to go to another town to report the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, if you can still remember, how many times have you been to the police to report the incident?  How many times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I will say three or four times we went to the police to report the matter and even when they burnt my shop I went to the police to report this and also went back to enquire whether they arrested someone in connection with that, because I knew I saw those people in court and I knew these were the people who burnt the shop, but they were not arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADVOCATE MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I do not know maybe, I may be allowed to say something which I might want to say before the committee.  Do I have that right to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Yes, you may.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Between April and August these people have done a lot of things to us and we were patient enough.  They came and shot one of our brother in the Sappi company.  This man was a truck driver with the Fire Fighting Department.  They knew that he stayed in that compound.  Therefore, they went there and burnt, light some fire around the place so that he can come out and they went outside and shouted and said there is fire and when he got out of the compound they shot at him.  They failed to shoot him.  He ran with the truck and he managed to call the White man through the two ways radios and the people ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>	The following day soldiers came and arrested the people, those leaders, especially the leaders in the IFP rank in Richmond.  We knew and we heard that they were in Richmond Police Station.  I went there, I saw them personally and I greeted them inside the police station.  I found firearms lined on top of a table.  Some of them were unlicensed firearms and I knew those arms, because I was from Gengeshe.  On the following day the very same arms or firearms, I had seen them in Gengeshe with a very big, plastic carrying the ammunition and I asked one of the police, while knowing the truth, and I knew them and I saw those firearms.  I knew they were not licensed.  However, when I arrived at Gengeshe on the 26th I found the very same arms and some of them were left inside the house while they were running and they burnt with the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>	Those people were collected by Mr Matthyson and he said they must not arrest them, they must release them and be given their firearms, because he was a person who did not want them to be disarmed and Mr Matthyson himself, he was also a police reserve and the police were very much afraid of him.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> When they were running out of Gengeshe after the 26th incident, he also ran away with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know where they, he is now, I think was the, do you know where he is now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Mr Groenewald, was an investigator, mentioned that he is somewhere, but I do not remember exactly where, the name of the town which he mentioned.  He said he is somewhere  in one of the towns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, members of the committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADVOCATE MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say he was there on the 26th and that he ran away with them or do you mean he ran away after the 26th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> He ran after the 26th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Poswa, who is Keswa Poswa, the one who killed your son?  Are you any relation to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Keswa Poswa is the young brother of one IFP member, it is my brother.  Indaba Zimboeza Poswa is my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So, Keswa Poswa is your nephew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, he is, I would say he is my son, but it is nephew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And did the police not investigate the death of your son which led to the arrest of Mr Poswa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Keswa was arrested.  He went to Sipling.  He was, appeared before the court.  On the 6th of October he was found not guilty by the court.  Witnesses did come and give evidence that they saw him killing the young boy.  They said he shot him with a rifle, 16 bullets from front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Now, you have testified that the reason why you went back to Gengeshe was to go back to your homes and you also ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> ... went to inspect damage to two of your shops.  One at Umkumazi and one at Gengeshe on the 26th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct and also to stay there, because we had the right to go back to our places, because we were born there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> When you went back did you not anticipate or realise that you could meet with some kind of resistance from the IFP supporters who were, at that stage, the only people who were staying at Gengeshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We expected that to happen, that they might attack us, because we knew they were staying there, those IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Poswa, it appears from the post mortem reports, which were prepared for your trial, that most of the people were shot.  You remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I will agree with that statement even if I did not saw, see that some of them were shot or not, but I knew that some were shot.  I know how many there were and there were those who were stabbed with spears.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It seems that quite a lot of them, quite a number of them, in addition to being shot, were stabbed with spears or cut with bush knives.  Is that so?  After they had fallen down did people come and stab them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, can I just clarify just one aspect.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADVOCATE MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Poswa, on the names that you have referred to by you on page 48, I note that there is a Becker Poswa, the deceased, there is another too Lebona Poswa.  Are they not your relatives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Becker Poswa, he was a brother and a very good brother of mine.  Unfortunately, he was an IFP and I was an ANC.  That is why we had the conflict.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> So you were divided by the political affiliation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> We have different fathers, but I will say he is a real brother even if we had some family ceremonies, you have to be invited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> What is the relationship between yourself now and Becker Poswa's family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I do not know very much, because I am still in prison, but my brothers who are outside and my children, they are saying they have a peaceful relationship.  They even visit each other and live together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> And I can take it that you are also in a position to, if you are released, if you meet them to go back to them and to get engaged in some kind of reconciliation with them?  You prepared to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, I will have to continue where they are from now.  I also wanted to add Indaba Zimboeza Poswa came twice to me in prison.  We shake, we shook hands and he said, he asked for forgiveness that his son has killed my son and that we were also affected by the political situation and this what created this.  This was not suppose to have happened and that he is sorry about it.  We shook hands and he also gave me money and food.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADVOCATE MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So would you say that this, these two groups are now reconciled or in the process of reconciling to one another?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> I think they have reconciled, from what I know, because I heard it a long time ago that they live together and have reconciled and I have not heard that there is any among them who want to do anything bad, because they are now living together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Does that mean, Mr Poswa, that your family has now gone back to Gengeshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Even if my family have not fully returned to Gengeshe, my mother and her other children are back in Gengeshe.  My, could have been there at this time.  Unfortunately, they do not have a place to stay, because my house was burnt down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are those who have been able to build something for themselves, have been accepted by the alleged IFP members who remained at Gengeshe and there are no longer conflicts between the two groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> After the 26th of 1992, the IFP people moved out of Gengeshe.  They went to a place called Patenie.  So, it was only an empty area, like, there was nothing.  There was nobody staying in that area.  During 1994 the ANC supporters went back to the area and they also asked the IFP members to come back.  The IFP members refused to come back to Gengeshe and they continued staying at Patenie.  So, all the ANC members are back to Gengeshe and they are still waiting for the IFP people to return.  IFP people do go there, but they have not returned to stay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So, we can say that these people are reconciling?  I mean the two parties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> We appreciate it if it is like that, because it is a painful situation where people have been born in same family are to be divided because of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No re-examination Mr Chairperson.</p>
