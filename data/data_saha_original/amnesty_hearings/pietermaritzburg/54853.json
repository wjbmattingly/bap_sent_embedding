It looked like there were people inside that car.  We stopped from a distance and one of us got out and went to that car and he spoke to them and come back after some few minutes and he came with two men who I did not know.  I was seeing them for the first time.  I did not even know their names.\n\tWe then drove to Joshua Doore.  I went there to park there.  After they told me to park the car at Berger Street, if I remember well.  The two men left and went straight to Joshua Doore.  I did not know what they were going to do.  It did not take much time.  After they left I heard a gunshot and then I saw this man running towards me, coming back and then later there were some gunshots again.  These men jumped into the combi and they said you should leave this place as soon as possible and we left in so fast from, we left the place quickly.

This Lombo and his fellow sympathisers were coming with the police.  The police were dressed in uniform.  There were White police and Black policemen.  When people were burning houses, killing people the police were there, they did not offer any help.  That created an impression where I could not trust the police, because I thought they were part of the Inkatha people who were killing the people in our community.

I submit, with respect, that the application on behalf of all three applicants should succeed on the basis, one, that a political motive has clearly been established and, in addition to that, there has been full disclosure in relation to the incident in question.  As regards the political motive, the conflict in the area, the fact that the two applicants, the first two\napplicants were MK members and they received orders to perform the actual hit in question and, in addition to that, I submit, with respect, that it can be, it is clearly established that the deceased in this matter was a member of an opposing party and, based on evidence in bundle, specifically I refer to the letter from the Attorney-General, on page 54 of the bundle, he was a prominent IFP member and, specifically, the third paragraph there, the person writing on behalf of the Attorney-General indicates and I quote,\n\"The deceased was a member of the Inkatha, possibly a hit man and he was an accused in two murder cases then awaiting enrolment in the High Court.\".\nFurther, what is important, is the Attorney-General's letter indicates that, I quote,\n\"There appears to have been, this appears to have been a politically motivated crime.\".\n\tI also think that it is common cause in the statements by some of the relatives of the accused in the bundle, that the deceased was a prominent IFP person.  I refer to page 92 of the bundle, the statement of Wilson Lombo and, in addition, the statement of Abner Lombo on page 91 of the bundle where the brother of the deceased, who made this statement, states that he was the branch Chairman of Mavundlanie Ward of the Inkatha Freedom Party.  \n\tIn respect of the escapes, I submit the, the application on behalf of the first two applicants is also, it is also clear that there was a political motive and that in that regard I submit that cognisance can be taken of the assistance given by the ANC to facilitate the escape, both prior to the escape, during the escape and in order to transport and hide persons until they were safely evacuated from the country.  \n\tI submit that there disclosure in respect of the, this incident, in addition, has been full.  Not that the next point I am going to raise is an essential factor for applications of this nature.  I submit, however, that the fact that this incident was discriminate in the sense that a particular person was identified, he was the only person injured.  No attempts were made to injure anybody else.  \n\tThe second applicant or, sorry, the first applicant made it clear that they were concerned about the safety of people surrounding, the fact that the incident only involved one shot at close range reduced the risk to anybody else in the vicinity and, in addition, the same applies to the escapes.  There appears to have been minimal force used in respect of the escape.  In fact, the only force mentioned was that of the first applicant when he indicated that he pushed over his guard, but, and then managed to escape from custody, but no persons or innocent persons were killed in the incidents, both the incident at Joshua Doore and the escape incidents.  \n\tAlso, I would like the committee to take notice of the fact that the deceased in this matter was mentioned prominently in the hearing before committee members, Mr Richard Lister and others when the enquiry was held on the Seven Day War and I submit that this substantiates the evidence of the applicants, that the deceased was a person who was very active and involved warlord operating on behalf of the Inkatha Freedom Party and whilst the first two applicants did not have personal knowledge of this individual's activities, I think the evidence before the commission, both at, in this committee and the other committee on the Seven Days War, substantiates that whilst this was hearsay for them it was, in fact, it is, in fact, evidence that is based in reality.  I submit in the circumstances that all the applicants should succeed.",

            "Right.  It is not the normal practice of this committee to give extemporary judgements and it is not our intention to do that today.  The method of granting amnesty is as prescribed in the Act, that is publication in the Government Gazette and due notification.  We feel, however, that in the light of what has happened here today, it would be of assistance if we were to place on record our views.  The three applicants have applied for amnesty.  Two of them, all three in respect of the killing of the late Mr Lombo and the first and second in respect of escaping from custody consequent upon their arrest in respect of that killing.  The late Mr Lombo's family was represented here today by Mr Miranda, who expressed the views of the widow, and I would like to repeat some of what he said that the family leave the decision in the hands of the committee, they have not sought in any way to influence that decision, but that the widow has placed on record the fact that she cannot, herself, forgive what has been done, that that is only something, something that only God can do and that is something that the applicants and others should bear in mind at all times.  That forgiveness is something they must earn and can only do so if they are truly contrite.  She has also explained, understandably, that she cannot forget the loss of her husband and with this we sympathise with her deeply.\n\tReturning to the facts of the case, of the evidence that was led it is another example of the tragic bloodshed caused in this province by the constant fighting between various political parties, in particular, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the UDF, as it then was, and the ANC, as it now is.  This has been particularly evident in the Edendale and Richmond areas and is, as we all know I think, a different aspect of it sprung up again last week.  It seems clear, and it was not challenged, that the first two applicants as well as being members of the UDF were also members of the organisation known as Umkhonto we Sizwe and had received certain training of a military nature.  \n\tIt is clear from the evidence they gave and from the evidence of the third applicant that they believed that the deceased was, what has come to be known, as a warlord.  This was their belief, there is no evidence, as such, but what is clear from the evidence and the letters written by his own brothers, is that he was a well known, respected member of Inkatha.  He was a leader and it is for this reason that the opposing organisation decided that he should be eliminated and orders were given to the applicants, the first and second applicants, to carry out the elimination.  They were assisted in this by the third and fourth applicants.  It is clear that it was a deliberate assassination and we accept the evidence that it was so planned that there was no danger of injuries to innocent passers by.  This distinguishes it, in some ways, from other cases that we have heard where there has been reckless shooting which has killed not only the potential targets, but others who played no part in the struggle.  The evidence of the applicants was that they were ordered to do this, that they were obliged to carry out orders and that, accordingly, this was an act committed on behalf of the party they belonged to which was one of the more prominent of the liberation movements.  We also accept that the escaping was also part of the political struggle, that they were assisted in this by the organisation they belonged to and it is clear that almost immediately after the escape, they were smuggled out of the country and given further training.  \n\tFor these reasons it appears to us this is a case where amnesty should be granted and it is our intention to take the necessary steps to ensure that that is done.  We do not, however, propose to nor do we consider it necessary, unless requested to do so by any of the parties, to give further reasons for our decision.  I think that what I have said here today explains why we have come to this decision and that one of the reasons why we have done this is we think it is in the interests of the victims and of other interested parties who have taken the trouble to come and listen to our hearings, that they should be aware of the result of them and not merely read them in the Government Gazette three weeks later.  \n\tI would also like to ...",
