            "Mr Chairman, the attack on white civilians is not a new thing, when you look back at the history of PAC, the formation of Polko on the 11th of September 1961, if you remember the attacks at Mbashe, Paarl and Komane, those comrades of those days were members of the PAC which was converted into APLA.  They were attacking white civilians during those days, even history confirms that.  Therefore I find it difficult for me when one of the panel members says we're shifting as to our targets.  Instead of attacking security forces, we were attacking white civilians which I refer to as: \"soft targets\".  Farmers were also attired before the attacks on Gold Gloves and St James and other attacks.  That's the reason why I say I am confused when they say we have shifted in constitution targets because this started long ago.",

You decided against that because you said african people in the vicinty may have been injured. You assessed that risk and you decided nevertheless not to attack the restaurant and you went elsewhere.  Isn't that so, isn't that true?",
