            "During that time we were staying at Nada, at Chief Shiyabante Zondi's place.   Because there was another gentleman known by the name of Lawrence Zuma.  During that time Chief Shiyabante Zondi told us that we should join the Police Force.  During those days he took us to Maroa House near Edendale.  There we were asked details about ourselves and we gave our details and we were all members of the IFP.  After that we went back home.  We stayed at home for about a week and after a week we were told that we were supposed to go for our training.  We left by buses to the training centre.  It was in Cape Town at Koeberg.  We left by buses.  We were all members of the IFP.  There was no one belonging to the ANC.  When we arrived there we were put in groups and we were taught lots of orders and laws and they explained all of them to us, that if you arrest someone who has broken the law you must do this and this and then afterwards at about past 11 we were taken to march.  After two weeks\n1A - 11.2\tafter/...\nMR BANADE\t84\tMR MADLALA\nafter we arrived in Cape Town, one member came from Maritzburg from a Security Branch.  That member was Mr Webb.  Mr Webb came to Cape Town by helicopter.  When he arrived there he told us that things were bad at Maritzburg.  People were killed and those people were IFP members who were killed.  We were shown video tapes and we saw people who were being necklaced by tyres and we saw houses were burnt down and people were killed.  We saw all this in a video tape.  And all those people who were being killed were IFP members.  Then we were told that we were supposed to finish our training soon so that we go back and fight UDF and ANC and we were told that UDF were members of the ANC, or they were sent by ANC that they must overthrow the Government.  We were told that we must come back to Pietermaritzburg and kill everyone who belonged to UDF or ANC and we were given guns.  We were taught how to shoot and we were taught how to march as well. \n\tAfter six weeks we came back from Cape Town to Maritzburg.  When we arrived in Maritzburg we were put at Umbali Railway Hostel.  We didn't stay there that long, we were taken to Oriep(?).  There was a huge riot station there.  That's where we were taken.  We arrived there and Captain Eugene Terblanche was the one who welcomed us.  He told us that since we were from Cape Town we were supposed to work here in Pietermaritzburg like we were taught in Cape Town.  We mustn't be scared of anything and we must harass ANC, and if it comes to a push we must kill them.  We mustn't be scared because all those cases were going to be over.  He, Mr Terblanche, was going to put those cases aside.  And we were allocated to secure IFP prominent people or to safeguard those houses.  \n1A - 11.2\tAfter/...\nMR BANADE\t85\tMR MADLALA\nAfter that we were stopped doing that and now we were given police vans.  All these things were happening and when we were meeting people who were meeting ANC sheets we were supposed to kill them or to harass them.  \n\tIt was like nothing.  Also we were working at Hammersdale and we were killing people there and after a person has been killed, Captain Eugene Terblanche was the one who was there first before anyone could be there.  We also worked in Greytown, Richmond, doing the same job.  And also here in Maritzburg, also in C-Vale. \n\tOn the 24th February we received a message that we must go and safeguard a meeting.  That was an ANC meeting.  It was going to occur at Noshesi area.  We took a police van, we went there and at Noshesi.  When we arrived there we found supporters of ANC and they were marching and singing, toyi-toyi and we realised that as they were singing and marching they were also naming IFP members and we go angry at that because we were IFP members and we didn't agree with their songs.  That's where we started as well toyi-toying and then other people who came to see Mr Harrington, who was the guy who was looking after the group which we were working at.  They told him that what we were doing they didn't like it.  \n\tMr Harrington told us that we must stop doing that and he told us that the ANC wasn't happy.  The meeting went on.  After that meeting we left Noshesi, we passed Nateni.  When we arrived at Dambuza, just before we arrived at the railway lines, we saw a group of boys.  If I am not mistaken they were 15.  All those boys who were there they had ANC T-shirts.  Some of the T-shirts had just President Mandela's photograph.  Some of them Sisulu's.  After that I saw a car\n1A - 11.2\tstop/...\nMR BANADE\t86\tMR MADLALA\nstop and Erasmus got out from that car together with Mr Harrington and they said to us we must go and search those boys.  We went, all of us, no one remained at the van.  We all went to the boys.  We told them to stand up;  we started searching them.  When we were searching them, the one I was searching, when I asked him his surname he told me he was Mkhize.  There was no conflict between me and him because Mbongeni disrupted me.  He told others that these policemen, we must shoot them and we must kill them like we killed the IFP people at Shange.  When I heard that this boy is saying this, I got angry because I remembered that there were a group of IFP people who were killed at Shange.  Now I told Harrington, I said to him, here's this guy now confessing that he's the one who was involved at Mbongeni's killing.  Now we realised that he was hard and then Erasmus and Harrington arrested him.  They put him at the back of the van.  Harrington came with us inside the van, at the back of the van, and we didn't close the back door, and we were ready for any action.  \n\tWhen Harrington got at the back of the van we went to Georgetown.   When we arrived at Georgetown Mbongeni was busy screaming, asking where he was being taken.  Erasmus stopped the van and then he came at the back.  He started harassing Mbongeni.  He hit Mbongeni.  He told Mbongeni to keep quiet.  After that he asked us what we wanted to do or where we wanted to go.  We explained to him that it was now late and we were about to go back home.  It was fine for him if he can take us back home and take others who were supposed to go to work.  That's what he did.  \n\tWhen we left Georgetown we were still with Mr Harrington.  He wasn't at the front, he was in the back.\n1A - 11.2\tHe/...\nMR BANADE\t87\tMR MADLALA\nHe started choking Mbongeni by his belt.  At that time the van was mobile and we were busy asking him, are you the one who wants to kill us, the IFP members, why do you want to kill us?  There were only a few people who didn't know that we were IFP members, even though we were special constables.  We travelled and Mr Jama was being assaulted, Harrington was choking him using his belt.  That's where I saw a diary.  This diary had names.  Names of the people, IFP members.  There was a name Mbalazi Vezi.  Mbalazi Vezi according to my knowledge was an IFP prominent member at Richmond.  And there were also names of the houses which were supposed to be burnt. \n\tAt that time Harrington was asking what was on the diary, was asking Mr Dhlamini, who was another member who  was arrested together with me, even though he has now been released.  What I cannot tell you is that I don't know what happened to the diary eventually, because I was sitting at the back of the van and I was holding the door.  \n\tWe arrived to Elandskop.  We stopped somewhere at Elandskop at Gqwanamu near the bottle store.  That bottle store belonged to Mr Gqinamu.  Harrington and Mr Erasmus and Mr Dhlamini, they got off the van.  Immediately after they got off Mr Jama tried to grab the gun from Mr Dhlamini.  He couldn't and Mr Harrington caught him. \n\tWhen he caught him he came with him back to the van and we put him at the back of the van alone;  we closed the back of the van.  Erasmus now told us that he was thirsty, he needed something to drink, something cold.  We told them that we didn't have money, but we can go and buy cooldrink for them at Mr Bengu's store.  We took the van;  we left them there.  Mr Dhlamini was also there at the back of the\n1A - 11.2\tvan/...\nMR BANADE\t88\tMR MADLALA\nvan.  We went to the shop, we took the drink, we came back.  We travelled about 2kms from the bottle store to the area where we left Harrington and Mr Erasmus.  When we got back we gave them the cooldrink.  \n\tAt that moment Mr Erasmus said we must kill Mr Jama.  As he was saying this, all of us police constables, we wanted to kill Mr Jama because Mr Jama was an ANC man and also he confessed that he was there when IFP members were killed.  So we all agreed that he must be killed.  No one refused or denied that.  All of us, we agreed that he must be killed.  And then Mr Bengu said he is going to show us the place where we can kill Mr Jama so that they don't discover his body soon.  We got into the van.  \n\tMr Bengu and Mr Erasmus got in at the front of the van so that he can show Mr Erasmus where to stop where we can kill Mr Jama.  We left that bottle store for about 5km and then we turned to a bush nearby.  We travelled in the bush and then we stopped somewhere.  When we stopped there Mr Harrington took Mr Jama out.  When they got outside Jama fell and then he started running.  Mr Harrington ran after him.  I ran after them too.  We were trying to catch Mr Jama, myself and Mr Harrington.  That's when Mr Harrington took out his gun and aim at Jama.  At that time he wanted to give me the gun that I must shoot Jama.  Then Harrington said no, don't be a fool.  If you kill this person using this gun when they discover this body they will discover the bullet and they will realise that it was our gun that shot him.  \n\tJama ran and Mr Harrington caught him.  When he caught him, Mr Harrington had this belt, the one that he was using at the back of the van.  Now he caught him where Jama fell\n1A - 11.2\tand/...\nMR BANADE\t89\tMR MADLALA\nand there were stones and rocks.  Jama fell and Mr Harrington fell on top of Jama and then he started choking him using that belt.  \n\tLater Mr Jama couldn't move at all.  Mr Harrington said to Mr Dhlamini, Mr Dhlamini must give me his gun because Mr Dhlamini had a (indistinct) gun and he said to me I must shoot Mr Jama.  I told Mr Harrington that no, I can't do that because he is already dead.  There is no need for me to shoot him.  \n\tMr Harrington said no, it might happen that he is just unconscious and he can regain consciousness and he can name us.  That's when I shot Mr Jama.  Of course I had this will of killing Mr Jama.  Because I wanted him to die as well, to follow those people whom he killed.  It was IFP members;  that's when I shot him.  Mr Harrington took branches from the tree and put those branches on top of Mr Jama's body.  We left.   Mr Harrington was at the back of the van.  He had a branch with him and he was wiping the wheels of the van so that people cannot realise that it has mud.  It has been somewhere in the bushes.  Mr Harrington got off the back of the car when we got to the main road and when we arrived at the first stop we stopped.  That's where I was supposed to get off.  Mr Bengu and Mr Dhlamini as well. \n\tWe got off and Mr Harrington got off and told us that now that we have finished what we have done, we mustn't tell this to anyone.  Whatever happened belonged to just us.  We've killed this person who did all these things at KwaShane and who is also an ANC member.  Then they left, Mr Harrington and Mr Venter. \n\tAfter that we were supposed to be off and we were supposed to go back to work after a day.  When we arrived \n1A - 11.2\tat/...\nMR BANADE\t90\tMR MADLALA\nat work that it wasn't all of us, and I didn't even think that maybe some of them were arrested and we went to David's house in Church Street, Maritzburg and they told me that we killed someone and I denied that at first because I didn't know at that time that there was any of us who has been arrested and I denied everything.  Then they showed me a statement and they told me that there's a statement.  Erasmus has already made a statement.  When I saw the statement that's when I realised that Mr Erasmus and Mr Harrington are now pushing the case to me.  Now they are shifting everything to me.  That's when I gave the police statement, another statement.  Even though those two statements were looking similar, but they were not the same until we appeared in court and we were sentenced. \n\tWhen we were sentenced my sentence and Mr Harrington's sentence was the same sentence, eight years, eight years, and Mr Erasmus was six years.   We went to prison. \n(",

And interestingly enough, there are also references made to the conflict of the past.  \n\tThe second aspect is the applications of all the relevant facts being put before the Committee, full disclosure that is, and the further requirements are these contained in section 22 and in submission all three applicants resort to ... (CHANGE-OVER TO TAPE 2B)\n2B - 11.2\t... As/...\nMR BANADE\t113\tADDRESS\n... As far as full facts go ... that is probably the aspect that bothers the Committee, otherwise I do not understand the detail which has been gone into. \n\tIn submission, the facts in question were brought before Judge Thirion in court beyond a reasonable doubt, and that is why all three of them were convicted of murder.  So there can be absolutely no doubt that they are murderers.  \n\tThe finer details as to why they stopped, why the person was searched, who saw what, with all due respect had to and in anyone's memory would have somewhat become vague by now.  The applicants have absolutely no reason to come here and lie before this Committee and I think that can be accepted.  What they said before, and specifically before the Court, should be differentiated from what they have said today, if there are some differences, because the aim in a criminal trial is adversary.  Facts are withheld and others are emphasised.  But, it is the State's duty to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas here the facts are being brought to the fore as far as they can remember and to disclose, as far as they can remember, fully to the Committee.  \n\tIn submission, Sir, if there are differences in their versions, it is with regard to smaller aspects.  The fact is, and that has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and they acknowledge, that a certain ANC supporter had been murdered by them.  So as far as the Act refers to - I would say that it should be read in connection with the full disclosure.  The Act refers to \"full\" disclosure, and it should once again be read in the light of the fact that this incident took place six years ago, and everyone's memory is not as good.  And this is one aspect I would like to touch\n2B - 11.2\tupon/...\nMR BANADE\t114\tADDRESS\nupon, the fact that there were verbal agreements in certain paragraphs in the submission of Harrington and Erasmus.  \n\tYou have to take into cognizance that they are being held together and I would like to bring to your attention, after I had consulted with them and given the main facts they were told right, you go and do this on your own, and that was on a Saturday afternoon where I instructed them to fill in the missing pieces, and that they might have consulted with each other.  Under those circumstances,  that is neither here nor there.  \n\tHarrington is the one who was consulted with more verbally and in his submission Mr Erasmus borrowed some of his terminology.

            "Now to go to the political motive.  This part in section 20(1)(b).  In submission I think that should be the aspect where the Committee should have the least problem.  The whole context within which this murder took place indicates that it was within and in connection with a political motive.  Eight persons from the riot squad were in a certain vehicle, three of them white, five of them were IFP affiliates, not just IFP affiliates, but\tconfirmed IFP supporters, and the evidence here is overwhelming that and ANC supporter could not be a constable at the time.  They picked the man up and eventually his corpse was found in the bushes.\n\tThe point I am trying to make is before one even goes into all the detail you find this.  What might bother the Committee is were there no other objectives, and that is how I could understand the questions.  But i submission the Act says that it had to be in association with a political motive.  It does not say that it should only be a political motive or that the context in which it should have taken place should have been 99% a political motive.  \n\tThe Act leaves a loophole that there could be other objectives as well with the individual.  The little loopgate which we can look at is that there could be an association or a political objective.  And in the light of all probability I think it is quite clear to this Committee.\n2B - 11.2\tThe/...\n124\tMR BANADE\nThe people did not just say it in their submissions, but I think the entire context indicates such.  The murder was associated with a political objective.  I think if I could speak on behalf of Mr Madlala, I think it was much clearer in his case.  He was not a full policeman, he was a special constable, and from a very young age he was raised with being an Inkatha supporter.  Of course at that stage they still obtained information.  He heard about this man and his involvement in murdering IFP supporters.  So in my view he qualifies for amnesty in this regard.  \n\tThe same with Mr Erasmus and Harrington;  their evidence to you was that at that stage they were not card-carrying members of the AWB or any other right-wing political party, but they had right-wing attitudes.  But these are young men and found themselves in a riot squad and they were indoctrinated along that line of thought and worked under violent circumstances.  \n\tIt all indicates that they would have had this kind of attitude towards these people.  Here they apprehend a man, find a pocketbook in his possession.  Once again, after I read Judge Thirion's judgment last night, on page 814, where he refers to the pocketbook.  The pocketbook surfaced in that trial already.  They found a pocketbook.  Some of them understand Zulu.  Those who understand Zulu tell the others in the vehicle that this person has mentioned something about killing policemen and that he is anti-IFP and we also know that it took place approximately 14 days after the KwaShange bus incident.  With all due respect, I think this is ... (CHANGE OVER TO TAPE 3A) ... and at the very least  one of the objectives of this group was politically motivated. \n3A - 11.2\tIn/...\n125\tMR BANADE\n\tIn submission I think that it was probably 80% politically motivated.

And I think on a balance of probabilities it could have happened.  All 15 of them weren't thoroughly searched, but there was some sort of search conducted on Mr Jama.  The first problem which they would encounter is whether there was something hard on this person in the form of a weapon.  I do not think it was a thorough search and I do think it was possible that something as soft as a book could have been discovered at a later stage.  And the person who had initially searched him could have felt the book and probably not paid much attention to it since they weren't really looking for books, but rather weapons and so forth and that a weapon did not surface.  And at a later stage when they had this person in the back of the police van they could have felt that there was something else here and under more calm circumstances they could have found the book.  They saw that the man was trying to hide something and secondly they weren't merely searching for weapons but also for dagga. \nWhich could still have been hidden in that little pocketbook.  \n\tMr Chairman, I still do not think, notwithstanding the fact that there are probably a few questions about that, I do not think that the Committee can find that there was no pocketbook.

They are in a completely different category.  They are used to have a physical presence at certain places and they do not take matters to court.

And notwithstanding his avowed contempts and hatred for the ANC, he complied willingly in a spirit of great cooperation.  I find that strange. \n\tThen later on these 10 or 15 young men are accosted.\n3A - 11.2\tI/...\nMR BRINK\t133\tADDRESS\nI believe that they would all have been searched, because the purpose of the police was to check on whether they had things, as came out in the evidence, firearms, dagga and the like.  And then this notebook or diary or whatever it is, is discovered. \n\tIt doesn't matter from whom it came.  The point is that on the evidence, and if you accept the evidence, there was this document which was extremely important to the applicants, more particularly to Mr Harrington and Mr Erasmus, because had they kept that document, and after the death of Mr Jama, they could have taken that document to their superiors and said this is what we've done and although maybe we shouldn't have done it, we did it because we discovered this vital information.  That would have helped them.  But to throw this document away, this pocketbook or whatever it is away, seems to me to be something which certainly can't advance their case.  Had they kept it and had they not killed Jama, but they did kill him so it doesn't matter, but the point is they would obviously have done better by taking him to the police station and arresting him.\n\tAnd then it is very odd, when you consider that at the bottle store, without discussing the matter between themselves - and I now refer to the first and second applicants - they have exactly or almost exactly the same thought.  They both have this so-called inner explosion, they both suddenly are reminded of the murder of Major Terblanche, they both refer to a member of the ANC, an avowed communist sitting amongst them, they both refer to atrocities of the past, and this is very extraordinary to say the least, they then have this feeling without having \n3A - 11.2\tdiscussed/....\nMR BRINK\t134\tADDRESS\ndiscussed it. \n\tI think the problems the applicants face are those and I myself am not persuaded that a political objective has been shown.  There may well have been some sort of political motive, but I am not that that covers what is required in terms of the Act.  And unless there are any questions, those are my submissions.",

If the applicants were bent on their political objectives, then we fail to understand why the 10 people that were in the group who were members of the ANC, were  not all taken into custody and done away with.  Why Jama was selected.  And it seems that the deceased got killed simply because he put his hand in his pocket. \n\tHer belief is, and she is merely speculating, because this inquiry is merely about who is speaking the truth, she believes that her son was so badly assaulted by the police that they couldn't let him live in case he went to the authorities.  Having been found out they now use politics as an excuse for having done him in. \n\tShe is quite prepared to forgive them if they come clean and speak the truth, but she has faith in your Committee in deciding whether they should be granted amnesty or not.  \n\tHer one difficulty is the following.  That it appears from the evidence that the deceased was killed because he said something about the KwaShange incident.  She knows as a fact that her son was with her in Richmond at the time of the KwaShange incident and he could not have known about it or taken part in it.  So therefore the explanation tendered by the applicants for killing him, she cannot accept that.  \tThe other aspect that worries us is the fact that these applicants - some of them testified that Major Terblanche had given them an undertaking that if they got themselves into trouble he will be there to protect them.  But at the\n3B - 11.2\ttime/...\nMR JASSAT\t141\tADDRESS\ntime when the deceased was murdered, Major Terblanche was no more around, he was already dead.  So who was going to protect them?

We were aligned to the ANC and it was clear now that the situation was no longer conducive to being an ANC member.  It was difficult for us to hide ourselves and we ended up showing the community that we were ANC aligned and we did not believe that we had to be killed simply because we were members of the ANC.  It continued.  We spoke to the police, as I have already mentioned some names, but the police never went to arrest those people, not even a single one of them was arrested.  The very same police, Togozani Mguni was arrested but he was released the following day and that was the end of it.  Then in 1991 one comrade by the name of Lucky Mhlongo, who was at Sam's place they went to attack Sam's place and shot Sam there and killed him.  The people who did that were the Indunas Gambaqana Zuma, Mandla Nkosi Jaba Mzimela, Douglas Buza Mzimela as well as other people were present, but they were the prominent leaders.  So that's why I remember their names.   The first problem that we encountered was that as ANC members we were going to be eliminated.  And we remained being aligned to the ANC and we didn't want to have any conflicts with the IFP.  We used to conduct our meetings in the forests because we did not want to be detected by the Chief because the Chief was an IFP member and we kept on mobilising the community and recruiting them in a clandestine manner and they were able\n4A - 11.2\tto/...\nMR WILLS\t150\tMR MZIMELA\nto give us information as to what the plans were as far as Inkatha was concerned.  \n\tThen in 1992 the IFP was holding a march at Makolokola what they call Nqabani.  They said that's where they made resolutions that they were going to harass the ANC people.  One of them was Gerhard Vana Mzimela, who was mentioned as the leader of the ANC because in 1991 Harry Gwala and Chris Hani came to Empangeni Hall and he took some of the comrades and that's what made him to be on the wrong side of the Inkatha.  We discovered that through Alfred Nutunhlongo, who was at the meeting that was held at (indistinct) Gumede.  It happened that on the 22nd February 1992 Gerald was driving his car from Mhlangubu.  Because the road was passing at that man's place, he saw the people who were in that meeting but he continued to drive and he proceeded to Maqegana and went to another person called Philemon Ndoda Mzimela to tell him that he had seen Inkatha members conducting a meeting and he said he saw Nontu and he came to warn us that we should take our children away because the Inkatha was going to launch an attack and he left and went to Mhlangubu to another comrade called (indistinct) Zondi.  At about six that afternoon he got those people on the road where they stopped his car and they shot him, he died instantly, and they took his car out of the road and threw it out of the road.  On that very same night another group of men who were armed went to the house of a certain man who was known as a person who mobilised the community.  He also owned a tuck shop and there was a belief that all those people who went into his house to buy were also directly involved in mobilising the community.  And whilst he was inside the tuckshop selling he saw a man who was standing at the \n4A - 11.2\tdoorway/...\nMR WILLS\t151\tMR MZIMELA\ndoorway and started shooting indiscriminately.  He got under the counter to try and hide himself.  Then he got a chance to escape, but he was not injured in any way.  Unfortunately three people who were there died and some were injured in the attack.  Jongula Mhlongu is one of those who died, Puma Hahlo Mzimela as well as his wife and the others got injured.  And one of the people who got injured was an IFP member.  But since he got injured he realised that the IFP had actually injured him so he changed floors and joined the ANC.",

One member of the ANC came to report to us that another group was attacking his house.  I went together with him.  We went to his home to see what damage was being done and when we got there we discovered that the house was in flames and we saw three members of the IFP who were burning the house and we started fighting and shooting at each other.  The IFP members ran away.  They got to Nqobo's house.  These members of the IFP who were running got into Mr Nqobo's house and they were actually shooting at us from inside the house and we shot back;  after quite some time we stopped shooting at each other.\n\tAfter I had stopped shooting, proceeding home, two kids came out of Nqobo's house.

            "In summing up I would like to summarise whether I think in my submissions the applicant does require with the requirements of the Act with the question of full disclosure.  My opinion is that the version given at the trial court is very different from the version that we are told today, but the applicant explained that he had no obligation to tell the truth at the trial.  Still though, with the evidence which that he has given us today, there are a lot of inconsistencies.  And the applicant hasn't come out clearly to explain factors and questions put to him.\n\tAnd just on the question of the children coming out and talking to the applicant.  I don't think it  is very likely that children who are in the house, a house that has just been shot at, can be so courageous to come out and actually speak to the person who has been doing the shooting.  But I don't know, it is just my opinion.  As I said before, the applicant does not seem to be a good speaker, if I may put it so.  It is like he is unable to explain himself and the sequence of events clearly.  So it is very difficult for me to make an opinion whether a full disclosure was made or not.  It is not convincing that it was, but I may be wrong.\n\tThen on the question of political objectivity.  We may not doubt the fact that the incident occurred during a time of ANC/IFP unrest in KwaZulu/Natal.  At the same time there\n3A - 13.2\tis/...\nMS THABETHE\t232\tADDRESS\nis nothing which shows the connection or a causal link between the offence committed, that is the shooting of the two females and children, and the political objectivity sought to be achieved.  There is no connection between the two.\n\tAt the same time the applicant indicated that their purpose was to kill three IFP people who had attacked the Luthuli kraal.  However, I don't think that would justify the killing of the Nqobo family and children.  I am not clear as to what the political objective was.\n\tThank you, Chairperson.",

It is my submission that the question of a full disclosure and the question of political objective are in a way interlinked.\n\tIn my view, the applicant has done all in his power to disclose the events which took place on the day in question.  The question boils down to the question of probability of his version.  And the improbabilities that are pointed out is the question of shooting.  The improbabilities in his version mainly have to do with the question of the bullets that penetrated the children.  The child was there and also the two females were there.  \n\tIn my view if the version of the applicant is accepted that there was a shooting from inside, surely it cannot be said with reasonable certainty which bullets that penetrated the deceased were really from the applicant.",
