I asked as to how many they were and he said they were many.   I left the house, I don't quite remember as to who I left in the house, at any rate I left with the person and so he could identify the place, and as I left, we came across Mgmalo's vehicle, he was coming from work.   I stopped him and I told him that Nkosi had just delivered this news and Mgmalo asked as to whether we trust this Mbhele, or I trust Mbhele.   I said to him there is nothing I can repudiate when I receive such news, and I don't think we should let go of such people, because they may be dangerous, and Mgmalo said we should go to his brother, another Mbhele that is.  We got into the car and we drove to the brother, and he was there with his two sons and we took them with and we drove now to that place and Mbhele knocked at the door and they could not open, or rather they did not open, and I knocked and I told them that it's me, Sosha, and please open the door, and the door was opened and I had a big torch with me and I went under the bed to check and I saw shoes and I could tell that there's a person hiding and I asked him to get out of that hiding place and he indeed got out of there to the open and I asked him if he knew any of the people I was with and he said no.   I instructed him to get into the car and I went back into the house now to inquire further from Twasa as to where were others.   As I was asking, I suddenly heard Mgmalo screaming and saying, \"He's running away\", and I got out of the house, and I got out and shot at him, and it was at night, I was using the torch at the same time, so I had in my possession a torch plus the firearm, and I shot at him and he died on the spot.   The most sad thing was that what Mbhele said to me, I did not prove it to be true, so that's what makes me feel this much remorse.",

Right, we will adjourn till 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.\nCOMMITTEE ADJOURNS",
