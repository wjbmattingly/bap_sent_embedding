Mr Chairman, apart from the fact that Mr Erwee was made out quite \nclearly as the villain of the situation, it goes much wider than that.\n\tYour efforts here to establish the truth Mr Chairman, is seriously jeopardised \nbecause if witnesses feel that they are going to be allowed to be misquoted this way, it \nmay very well jeopardise them coming forward, their willingness to come forward.\n\tI will take it no further, I just want to place it on record and I want to invite the \nSABC to rectify their poor and inaccurate reporting tonight with the same prominence \nas they did last night and apart from that, I don't want to say anything more about it \nMr Chairman.\n\tMr Erwee, is still under cross-examination.

Mr Erwee, I think what \nI asked you yesterday was whether in your planning, since you had anticipated some \nkind of resistance from the six cadres, in an endeavour to arrest them, my question was \nwhether you had taken any measures to ensure that minimum force was used by you \nand your members in defending yourselves against the attack by the six cadres in that \nminibus, that was my first question.

When it \nwas said to me that the insurgents are busy crossing the border and that they were \ncarrying bags with them, the observation post didn't notify me whether the people had \ntheir firearms outside and that reassured me that the planning would fall within the \nframework of our planning, because it would have been an unheard of thing for \ninsurgents to drive around, showing their firearms openly.\n\tIt would have been very risky.  For that reason, I believed that when we \nstopped the vehicle and threw the hand grenade to cause shock and confusion, that by \nthe time the insurgents have taken out their firearms, cocked them, etc, that they at \nthat stage already would have realised that here is an armed vehicle and weapons are \naimed at us, uniformed people surrounding us etc.\n\tThat is why I believed that we will be able to arrest the insurgents without \nthem really offering any resistance and then when I saw through the window how the \npassenger in the left front shot through the window and that Captain Born collapsed, \nand I then also heard a short volley of shots, it is true we are trained, I myself am \ntrained in the case of contact with insurgents, you deliver maximum fire power to \nprotect your own life and not as in the normal situation.  You are trained in that \nsituation, to give the maximum fire until there is no resistance left.\n\tI must also mention it to the Chairperson, that when I started firing, I fired at \nthe combi and at the passengers.\n\tThere was teargas so I couldn't see very clearly, I couldn't see very clearly \nwhere each person, each passenger was sitting, I just fired.",

            "Mr Chairman, I would like to ask before I am excused, the question \nnow arises why am I here today.\n\tAnd I would like to say to the Commission that firstly I am making this \napplication for amnesty in the spirit of national unity and the promotion thereof, in \norder to find peaceful solutions and also to promote reconciliation.\n\tAnd also to move away from violent resistance politics in the future.  The \noffences about which I have doubt whether I was competent or whether it was lawful, \nare firstly that I believe that when we were shot at, I acted lawfully and that I had the \nauthority to fire back.\n\tBut, that I have doubt and I am in an ambivalent situation regarding the \nquestion of whether I exceeded my bounds.  This doubt is based on the fact that Dr \nDe'Oliviera thought it necessary to investigate the matter and Archbishop Desmond \nTutu has said on many occasions, where you have any doubt, you should rather apply \nfor amnesty in the spirit of reconciliation to put all the facts on the table.\n\tThe National Commissioner also thought it necessary to arrange a special \noccasion in Pretoria to put it to us that if we should have any doubt, that we should \nrather apply for amnesty in the spirit of national unity and reconciliation.\n\tFurther Chairperson, from experience I know that courts take days and weeks \nto hear matters and it takes trial within a trial to determine whether we exceeded the \nbounds at a shooting incident, for instance.  And as far as a possible charge of \nobstructing the course of justice is concerned, I am very honest when I say to the \nCommission, that the handling of the inquest docket, I did not include all the  \n(indistinct) of sequences in this docket, because I believed that that which I did include \nin the docket, in the inquest docket, was sufficient to enable the Presiding Officer to \nmake a finding in this inquest.\n\tAnd if it should be found that I committed an obstruction of justice, I ask for \namnesty for that in the spirit of the promotion of national unity and reconciliation.",
