<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>ADV VISSER:	Mr Chairman, the next witness will be Mr J.H. Kruger.  His evidence you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>will find at B, page 59.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>JOHACHIM HEINRICH KRUGER:	(sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>EXAMINATION BY ADV VISSER:	Mr Kruger, you are an applicant for amnesty before </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>this Committee and you have filled in the prescribed form.  Have you got your amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>application in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>MR KRUGER:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>ADV VISSER:	Have you read through it and do you confirm that the information contained </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>therein, is as far as you knowledge goes, true and correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>MR KRUGER:	It is true and correct, I just want to make a small amendment.  Also at </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>paragraph 8(b), page 2, point number 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>	In 1986 I became an Officer, that should be 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>ADV VISSER:	Apart from that change, you are happy that the rest is all correct?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>	Reference was made to certain documents which you are going to ask to have </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>incorporated into your application.  It is a document submitted by the Foundation for </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>Equality before the Law and General Van der Merwe's submission to the Truth Commission </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>and you are requesting on page 60 of B, that the application of Mr Erwee be incorporated </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>into your application in respect of the facts and the incident itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>MR KRUGER:	That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>ADV VISSER:	You have listened to the evidence of the other applicants who testified here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>MR KRUGER:	Yes, I listened to all the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>ADV VISSER:	Now, apart from Mr Sehlwana's evidence, do you differ substantially with </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>their evidence in any way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>MR KRUGER:	No, I don't have any differences with that.  I agree with it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>ADV VISSER:	Could you tell the Committee where were you placed on the day of the 10th </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>of July?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>MR KRUGER:	On the 10th of July I was in the casper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>ADV VISSER:	You've heard Mr Erwee's evidence inter alia as to how the casper moved into </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>the road and what happened further.  Is there anything which you observed or heard which is </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>different to what Mr Erwee testified and or the last witness Mr Swarts' evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>MR KRUGER:	No, I agree with Mr Erwee's evidence entirely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>ADV VISSER:	Did you also answer the fire which came from the combi that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>MR KRUGER:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>ADV VISSER:	How many rounds did you fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>MR KRUGER:	I didn't change magazines, so there are 20 bullets in a magazine, therefore I </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>think I shot between 10 and 12 rounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>ADV VISSER:	Where were you aiming your gun when you shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>MR KRUGER:	At the combi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>ADV VISSER:	Were you the first person to shoot or did somebody else shoot first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>MR KRUGER:	I was definitely not the first to shoot.  To my right were people who started </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>firing and after that I realised that there were problems and I also started firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>ADV VISSER:	How did you understand your instructions as to what was to happen with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>passengers of the combi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>MR KRUGER:	It was made clear to me that an arrest should be made and that the people </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>who were in the combi, had to be arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>ADV VISSER:	Were your instructions to do so at all costs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>MR KRUGER:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Mr Visser, it intrigues me that you keep on asking to arrest at all cost, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>wasn't at all costs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>ADV VISSER:	It wasn't what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>CHAIRMAN:	It intrigues me that you keep on asking the witnesses whether they were at all </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>costs to arrest, it was not at all costs?  But I understand you of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>ADV VISSER:	I don't want to ask a leading question, but if you will allow me, I will do it </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>and we can save time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Yes, you were instructed to do everything possible to arrest them, but not at </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>the expense of your own lives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>MR KRUGER:	That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>ADV VISSER:	Thank you Chairperson.  According to you, did you carry out your </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>instructions as a policeman and your specific instructions on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>MR KRUGER:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>ADV VISSER:	Do you think you did anything wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>MR KRUGER:	No, I don't think I did anything wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>ADV VISSER:	Why did you apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>MR KRUGER:	Last year, November, I saw reports in the media and heard reports on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>radio and the general import of this was that people should come forward and ask for </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>	Our National Commissioner also appealed to the members to apply for amnesty if </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>they had any doubt as to whether they should or not.  I spoke to people and they told me it </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>wasn't necessary to apply for amnesty.  I was in doubt and I also spoke to Mr Erwee and it </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>then became clear that there was apparently an investigation into the incident and that made </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>me apply for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>ADV VISSER:	Is that where your doubt arose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>MR KRUGER:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>ADV VISSER:	Mr Swarts testified that he secured the scene there.  Did you have any role to </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>play in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>MR KRUGER:	Yes.  Just to explain very briefly as an explosives expert it is policy that </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>usually only one person goes forward to the scene where there could possibly be explosives </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>or where explosives had to be disposed of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>	I stood close to Mr Swarts and I helped him.   For instance as he took explosives out </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>of the bus, he passed it onto me and I then just took it further away and guarded it, so that </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>nobody could get close to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>ADV VISSER:	Were you present when he took it into the bush to sort it out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>MR KRUGER:	I helped him carry it into the bush, but it was then all left in his hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>ADV VISSER:	That is all for this witness, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV VISSER.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Mr Rossouw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>MR ROSSOUW:	No questions for this witness, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR ROSSOUW.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Mr Black?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>MR BLACK:	No questions, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BLACK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Thank you Mr Kruger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>MR KRUGER:	Thank you.</p>
