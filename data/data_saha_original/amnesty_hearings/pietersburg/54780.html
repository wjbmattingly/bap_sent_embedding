<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a> </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> The next applicant will be Mr Pretorius.  His application form you will find in B, at page 67, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">LOURENS MARTIN PRETORIUS:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY ADV VISSER:</span> Mr Pretorius, you are an applicant for amnesty before this Committee and you are requesting amnesty for any offence or crime which you might have committed or which may be found to have been committed by you during the incident which took place on the 10th of July, 1986 on the Breslau/Alldays road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> You've completed an application form which you have in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> You checked it and do you have any changes that you have to make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Just at paragraph 8(b) on page 2, where it says March 1996, Station Commissioner in Makwoin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> What should it be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> It should be Makwoin.  The "n" should change into a "w".</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> Is that the only amendment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> So for the rest you confirm your statement as true and correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> You also referred to a submission made by the Foundation for Equality before the Law and also a submission made by Jan Velde Van der Merwe, to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and you request those documents to be incorporated into your own application for amnesty in so far as it is relevant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> You also referred to the amnesty application of Mr Erwee in respect of the incident of that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> Do you confirm that the political motive set out in your application is also applicable to you and that that is what you in fact believed at the day of the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> On the day of the incident, where were you, where were you placed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> I was in the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> You heard the previous three witnesses' evidence who were also in the casspir, Mr Erwee, Mr Swarts and Mr Fuchs.  Do you have any reason to differ from what they said, except that I didn't see Captain Born.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> You didn't see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> No, I didn't see Captain Born.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> Apart from that, did you hear the shot from the kombi's side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> Did you hear the swear word coming from the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> You heard the short volley of automatic gun fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> Did you hear somebody shouting they are shooting at us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> Did you also fire any shots on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Yes, I emptied one magazine and 20 shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> So you used up a full magazine of 20 rounds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> What was your gun aimed at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> At the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> So you could have shot or hit some of the people inside the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> Mr Pretorius, according to your view and understanding, what was the task that you had to go and carry out as far as the passengers of the kombi was concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> We had to arrest them, but not at the expense of our own lives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> Not at the expense of our own lives.  This is better, this is a clever witness which I have.  Do you think that you did anything wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> In terms of the specific instruction or your general instructions as a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> Maybe the question could arise, why did you shoot at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> I concluded that we were being shot at and our people started shooting back and I joined in the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV VISSER:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Rossouw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSOUW:</span> I have no questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR ROSSOUW:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Black?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLACK:</span> I have not questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BLACK:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Pretorius, you wanted to arrest these people.  They were shooting at you.  If I have it correctly, Mr Erwee shot 30 shots, Mr Kruger about 15, Mr Swarts about 15, you, 20 and with the pistol 9 or so shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>	Why couldn't it have happened that you for instance shot 10 shots and then said to the people, hands up and surrender?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> According to my training, as soon as you open fire, you deliver maximum fire.  I am not prepared to go back and find out whether these people are still able to return fire, I wouldn't endanger my life like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You can shout from the casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> I supposed we could have shouted from the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Would you say that was minimum force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> I am satisfied that we acted in accordance with my training and correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>	Perhaps we could have shot even more, but we didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I think Mr Pretorius maybe in fairness to you is to restate that you had your ground Commander in the casspir and you shot in his presence and he didn't say anything to stop you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>	He only gave the instructions to cease your firing after some time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRETORIUS:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> I have no further questions to the witness, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">NO RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV VISSER:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you Mr Pretorius.</p>
