My attorney has told me that these documents are indeed available at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and he said that we should put it to you that he undertakes to arrange for the document to be made available to you and if the TRC can't do so, then we will make a plan to do it ourselves.  May I just consult with him for a moment?\n\tChairperson, my attorney also informs me that he has a clean copy of that submission with him, if you want to have a look at it immediately.  As we said at the outset it is not our idea to actually deal with that background detail at the moment, but rather to leave it for a later stage.

They are fully aware of that.  So that Mr Chairman, I would submit that we can go on with the work in hand at the moment, to get the evidence on record.

What happened as a result of conditions pertaining at the time and how people reacted, and how those incidents and reactions led us to where we are today. It is an interesting document. It is also being summarised somewhat in book form and that book is available on the book shelves, Mr Chairman.  It is a book called The Other Side of the Story.

Capt Molapo, first of all denies that he had ever - would say such a thing to Mr Sehlwana, there is absolutely no reason for him to do so.  I am just giving you that information.  Secondly, Mr Sehlwana who is represented by attorneys, and it was through his attorneys that it was communicated to him about the dates of the hearings, where the hearings would take place, et cetera.  I asked Capt Molapo as to whether he had served notices on Mr Sehlwana and he says no, because we had summonsed him to this hearing through the means of his attorneys.  But in fairness to you, Mr Van den Berg, I did not ask Capt Molapo whether he at any stage had telephoned Mr Sehlwana.  And that is a fact which I can ascertain.  But certainly it was put, as I understood it, that he had been told to attend the hearing when it was put to Sehlwana, it was understood that the proposal put to Sehlwana was that Capt Molapo had told him to come to these hearings, and thereafter he would go and see the Deputy President and the Minister of Defence.  When I canvassed that with Capt Molapo he denied it.  Would there be any possible reason that you can think of, that Sehlwana, if he did in fact report this to you, would come up with such a fairytale?",

There seems to be developing in this hearing an idea that there are two parties against each other in front of you; that Sehlwana is say the one party and as opposed to him stands the other applicants. That's altogether not the situation, Mr Chairman. With great respect, the legal representative of Mr Sehlwana does not oppose our application. We do not oppose his.\n\tWe are not here in conflict with each other in the sense that one witness has to be broken down as far as credibility is concerned merely because he says something different from another. We didn't tender this evidence to make anything out of it.  We tendered the evidence merely because we believed it is something that happened that you should be aware of. We are not making any point of it. But we do find it objectionable, Mr Chairman, that this witness is cross-examined as if he is sucking something out of his thumb, because frankly, Mr Chairman, it has nothing to do with the merits of our application for amnesty. We suggest to you that we are wasting time, with all due respect to my learned friend, if we are - you will remember that we didn't attack Sehlwana's credibility. I didn't cross-examine him.\n\t  What we did in our questions, was to lift out areas where his evidence coincided with ours and where they differed.
