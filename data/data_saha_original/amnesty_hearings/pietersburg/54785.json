He later than informed us that apparently he had spoken to members of the Committee and who had felt that it wouldn't be necessary, but as you correctly point out, it is a matter which can be dealt with administratively and they can confirm.\n\tThe only point about that Mr Chairman is that Erwee hasn't confirmed his application in that regard and it may be necessary just to call him back to do that.
