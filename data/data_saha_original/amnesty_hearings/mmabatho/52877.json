It would be very convenient if we could argue it tomorrow at nine.  And then if the representatives could bear in mind that we would like to conclude it also tomorrow.  Thank you very much.\n\tWe have now reached the stage of this hearing where all the evidence has been completed and all that remains is for the representatives to make their submissions to the panel and of course for the panel to then consider the evidence and the submissions and arrive at its decision.\n\tWe accordingly going to be adjourning this matter now until tomorrow morning in this hall at 9 o'clock when argument will be presented, first of all by Mr Hendrickse, then by Mr Terreblanche, then by Mr van der Berg and then if Mr Mpshe has any submissions to make, he is certainly allowed to make them.  Thank you very much, we will then adjourn until tomorrow at 9 o'clock.\nCOMMITTEE ADJOURNS",
