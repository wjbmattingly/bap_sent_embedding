            "That is correct, Mr Chairman, the AWB, who is opposing the application for amnesty received the documents on the 31st of July 1998 at 17:45.   I was briefed on Saturday, and due to insufficient time, we were unable to properly prepare, and amongst other things, we tried to get hold a reporter of the Sunday Times, a Peter de Ionno, whom we say is an essential witness in these proceedings.   The offices of the Sunday Times was not prepared to supply us with his home telephone number, he was not on duty at the state, neither would they give us his address, so we were unable, over the weekend to make contact with this witness.  We had a look at a video shown to us this morning by my colleague, Mr Mpshe, and having seen that video, I'm more convinced that it is absolutely necessary that I speak with the gentleman concerned.   He was an eye witness and could supply vital information regarding the conduct of the applicant at the relevant period.   There is also a Ray Hartley of the Sunday Times whom we'd like to speak with.   \tSo my application is for a postponement to enable me to properly prepare and consult with the necessary witnesses, which was not possible due to the late receiving of the documents concerned.\n\tI submit it is in the interests of all parties concerned that the proper facts be laid before this committee.   Subject to the chairman's approval, we have arranged a date, which would be the week of the 21st of September to the 25th of September.   We appreciate that there is a public holiday in between, but it is our expectation that we should complete the matter in four days.  If not, we might consider utilising the public holiday, but my application, on behalf of the AWB, is that the matter then be postponed to afford us the opportunity to consult with these witnesses.",

            "Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Mr Chairman, I do not oppose the application for postponement, for one reason, inasfar as it pertains to Mr Engelbrecht's consultation with the journalist only, and not, I disagree inasfar as it goes to receiving of documents and other things.\n\tI just want to put the record straight.   Mr Chairman, the AW office was served with the notice on the 2nd of June 1998, section 19.4, it was served at the AW offices in Ventersdorp, I've got copies, by registered post.   Mr Chairman, I heard nothing from them, absolutely nothing from them, up till the 29th of July, when Mr Visagie called the Cape Town office on the 29th of July inquiring about the hearing and documentation.   Now, Mr Visagie alleged that he was, the AW was never served, which is not true.   They apparently have two different offices and we only know Ventersdorp office as the AWB offices, and that's where service was.   Now a letter came from Mr Visagie, who is in this hearing now, and this letter indicated that they never received any notice and the one documentation.   Now on the strength of him not having been aware of the notice service at the AW offices, the documents were then sent to them last week Friday, couriered, because, Mr Chairman, we don't serve notice and forward documentation to people who don't know whether they will appear, whether they have interest or not, because the meaning of section 19.4 is very clear, it does not compel a person to be there, he makes his choice, and if they don't make timeous choice or choices, either on the 4th or the 10th or the 20th of June, we cannot just forward documents.  They only contacted us after having made up their mind on the 29th of July, when we served them with a notice on the 2nd of June.   I just wanted to put this one straight, but I'm not opposing the application.",

Yes, thank you, Mr Hendricks, Mr Engelbrecht, Mr Van den Berg and Mr Mpshe, in view of the fact that the application for postponement is not opposed and also because of the reasons given for the application to enable the AWB, who intend opposing the application, to properly prepare themselves, and also because of the misunderstanding or whatever one may call it that resulted in the documentation only arriving so late last Friday, we are of the view that this matter, in order for it to be properly heard and properly presented by all sides, should be postponed, as has been applied for.   It is unfortunate.   Sure, we are all aware that we in the Amnesty Committee have a tight schedule and have many, many cases or matters to hear, and any delay of course complicates the whole process. \tThe matter is then postponed until the 21st of September 1998.\n\tMr Mpshe, I take it it will be at the same venue?",
