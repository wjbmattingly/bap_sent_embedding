<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SIBEKO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>	Mr Radebe, you are an applicant in this matter applying for amnesty, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Is it correct that you were a member of the Self Defence Unit for Lusaka-A?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> When did you join the Self Defence Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It was in 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Who was your commander at the time you joined the Self Defence Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It was Mosa Msimango.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Have you heard the evidence of Mr Patrick Radebe and Lucky Soko inasfar as it relates to the death of Gregory Mkwanazi and Mbuso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Did you understand what they said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Were you involved in that activity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Do you mind telling us about your involvement from the beginning up to the end of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I was at Lucky's place, it was in the evening.  When I was still sitting there Mbuso came and he knocked at the door and Lucky asked who was at the door, Mbuso did not respond.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>	Lucky asked for the second time and then Mbuso said "Come out with your axe".  Lucky was a person who used to joke.  He took his axe and he went to open the door.  After he had opened the door, Mbuso shot him.  I was looking at him.  We were sitting there with Lucky's family.  That is what I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now when you talk about Lucky, is he one and the same person as Gregory Mkwanazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, he is the same person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> You say you were at Gregory's place, where exactly in the house were you sitting and who else was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I was in the kitchen with his family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Are you in a position to state exactly who in the family of the deceased was there, because by family you can mean quite a large number of people.  Are you in a position to remember exactly who was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> What family are you talking about, Lucky's family?  A person - I've told you that it was his family, all the members of his family, even the children were there and the children saw everything that took place that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Was Lucky's father present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Was Lucky's mother present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, she was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If Lucky had a brother, was his brother there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Who else was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It was myself who was a person from outside but the majority of the people there were Lucky's family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Alright.  How do you that the person who was knocking at the door was Mbuso?  Did he mention his name or did you see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> When the person knocked at the door just before the incident occurred, was it during the day or was it at night, and if it was at night, could you see the person who was outside, was there a light that could enable you to see that this is so and so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, I could see because in Lucky's kitchen there was a light outside and so you could see a person who was standing outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now that the light was on, will I be correct to say that it was at night when he, it was in the evening when he came to Lucky's place, that is when Mbuso came to Lucky's place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, it was in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now, Mbuso knocked at the door, a few words were exchanged, that is who is the person is knocking and then ultimately Lucky ended up opening up the door.  Was there any other thing that was said before the shooting started, after the door was already opened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No, nothing else was said.  When he opened the door there was a shot and he ran away, he ran to next door and he came back as a person who was surprised, a person who did not know what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> When exactly did he come back and appear as if he is surprised as to what had occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Soon after the incident.  He came back on the very same night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Just for absolute clarity, you're saying Mbuso came back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Did Mbuso ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, Mr Sibeko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>	Did Mbuso say anything whilst he was shooting Lucky?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No, he said nothing.  I did not hear him saying anything, I just heard the shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did Lucky try to throw a blow with the axe he was carrying, on Mbuso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now when he came back after the incident, as you say he appeared as if he was surprised, did he say anything?  When he came back for the second time as you say he was surprised ...(end of tape)</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> ...(inaudible) I found him sitting there, sitting in the kitchen with his hands on his head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now let me get you clear here.  When Mbuso knocked at the door, the door was opened, when he fired you were in the kitchen.  When everything occurred you were still in the kitchen, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Was there a time after that incident when you left the kitchen or the house at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> After this incident I went home to fetch the car so that we could take Lucky to the hospital.  When I came I saw him sitting there in the kitchen, that is Mbuso.  I don't know what he said, if had said anything because I just got in there and he was quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Did you ask any question in connection with the said incident?  In fact did you ask him why did he do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No, I did not ask because I was also very scared, my heart was beating very hard.  I couldn't even talk because that incident was actually unexpected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did anyone of the people who were there in the house ask Mbuso why he had shot Lucky?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I don't know but when I came they were quiet, all of them were quiet in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Are you able to say how many times Mbuso opened fire on Lucky?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Only once, in the ear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> You say you went to fetch the vehicle so that you could take him to the hospital, did you actually take Lucky to the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, I took him to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> What happened thereafter?  Did you come back with him or did you leave him at the hospital and what happened thereafter?  What did you do thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We left him there at the hospital.  We were just taking him there because he was dead already.  We left him there at the hospital and we came back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Did you spend the night at Lucky's place, the very same evening after the incident took place or did you go home, or any other place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I went home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> The following morning, were you present when Mbuso came to apologise to the family of the deceased?  That is the following morning after the incident that occurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No, I was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Were you present at the time Patrick and Lucky Soko took Mbuso to the office at Mkwaie Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No, I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Were you part of the group that went to fetch Mbuso from the offices to the circle at Xhaba Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Do you mind telling us about the role or your active role at the time when he was, when Mbuso was fetched from the offices until he was executed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> When Mbuso was about to be fetched I was fetched at my home with Stick's kombi.  It was myself and Langa, Dingaan.  We went to fetch Mbuso.  I had a firearm, an  AK47.  We took Mbuso from Mkwaie Street.  He was already assaulted when we went to  Mkwaie, when we arrived there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>	I wanted to shoot him there at Mkwaie but the other people said I mustn't kill him there we must take him far away to kill him.  Mbuso requested us not to kill him far away from his home so as to make it easier for his family to get his dead body.  We took him to Xhaba Street.  At least it was nearer to his home.  We took him out of the kombi.  I shot him.  He died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Are you in a position to say or to tell us about the number of times you shot at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Seven bullets, I shot seven times with the AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is your client in a position to proceed or does he need a brief adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> That's what I wanted to find out, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Mr Chairman, I would request that we adjourn a while for this applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll take a short adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are we in a position to proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Radebe, I'm just reminding you you are still under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">DANNY RADEBE:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibeko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SIBEKO:</span> (Continued)  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>	Now Mr Radebe, you said you spent about seven bullets on Mr Mbuso Khambule(?), is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> At the time you shot at him, what was your intention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> My intention was to kill him because he had killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Will I be correct to say that it was mostly because the policy or the slogan that the killer must be killed when you decided to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Are you in a position to tell us as to what happened to the body of Mbuso after you had fired at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Truly speaking I don't know anything about that because after shooting him I ran away.  I don't know what happened to his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> After you shot at him were you in a position to assess whether he was still alive just before you left or was he already dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, I could see that he was dead.  The last bullet penetrated his head and I was certain thereafter that he was dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> I'm under the impression that you are in a position to remember as to the exact parts of his body, as to which parts of his body were affected.  Are you in a position to tell us, besides the last bullet that you've just referred to, exactly where in the body you shot at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, Mr Sibeko.  Do you think that detail is necessary?  I'm asking this question because last time when we adjourned he seemed to have been very much emotionally affected by this.  Maybe it could do more harm to him emotionally if one has to go through all those details as to which part of the body was hit by which bullet.  I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> I'll withdraw that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>	Now the AK47 that you were using, what happened to it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I took back to Mtjale Street because it belonged to the Mtjale Street people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Other than this incident, were you involved in any other incidents of violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No.  I used to be a taxi driver but after work I would go on patrolling with the other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> During your patrol did you confiscate any weapon from anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> So there are no other incidents wherein you were involved, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No other incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Is it correct that you are applying for amnesty firstly, because you were the one who shot at Mbuso and then secondly, of having possessed that AK47 at the time, which was unlawful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, that is what I am applying for amnesty for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SIBEKO</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Sibeko.  Questions, Advocate Steenkamp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> No questions, thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Mr Radebe, just assist me with one or two matters.  The night you were sitting in the kitchen, the night Lucky was killed, you went home to fetch a vehicle to get Lucky to the hospital.  When you came back you found Mbuso sitting in the kitchen, is that correct so far?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Did you confront Mbuso at all at that point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No, I did not talk to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Was there a particular reason for not asking him why he had done that, at that point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I said I was afraid, I couldn't even talk properly because my heart was beating so hard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But you had definitely seen him at the door and you know that positively he is the one who shot Lucky?</p>

<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then it appears to be obvious that they must have been known to each other, Lucky knew who Mbuso was and Mbuso knew who Lucky was?</p>

He used to tell me that he will never rest until I am dead.  Every time he used to utter such things.  Even now I'm not free wherever I go because of him.  I would request you here to give me a solution, tell me what to do about this situation because this has been happening for some time now.</p>
