And also to work a way finder was those colleagues that would come and launch an attack.  Those were my duties.</p>

<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAILE:</span> There is one incident that has been mentioned by Simphiwe Ndlovu in which a taxi was attacked at the hostel gate.  I was present.  I am the one who went in front before him, to make sure that there were no police and I came back to give him the information to the effect that it was safe, we could then go.  And then yes, we did go there.  I think it was on the third circle at a street that is facing the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>	When we arrived there myself and Thulani had to make sure that we look out for the police and they were facing a direction towards the hostel.  It was not long before we had arrived there, not more than five minutes.  As we were looking around we heard gunshots after which Simphiwe and Sipho appeared fleeing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>	As our duty to look out for the police, we continued doing that until we returned to our placed.  That is the one role in which I partook.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> So on that day, did you make use of any firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAILE:</span> I did not carry a firearm but Simphiwe and Sipho used to carry firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman,  no further questions.</p>
