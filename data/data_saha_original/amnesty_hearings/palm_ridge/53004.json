            "I can explain it this way.  From 1993, if I'm not mistaken one when we were patrolling we were in Givani Street, the corner of Givani and Ngaki.  We were used to patrolling during those days we found that there was one man in the road and we thought that he was one of the people who were under the ISU or the IFP.\n\tTo try and explain more, when we stopped these men, there were five of them and we did not trust these men because they were coming from the police car.  When they were coming towards us they put their hands in their jackets.  We were then forced to hurry because we didn't trust what was inside those jackets.  We were then forced to go and face them.  We were forced to shoot first before they could shoot at us.\n\tFortunately or unfortunately the four of them managed to run away.  This one man when he was trying to run away he ran towards Lusaka section where we found him in a shack.  If I'm not mistaken it was number 1776 in the circle.\t I think it's the third circle from Ngaki to Mkwaie.  \n\tWhen he was trying to lock himself inside the shack unfortunately we were already inside.  When he was trying to get out, the firearm was in my hand at that time, when he was trying to get out through the window he did not have a chance.  I hit him with the first bullet.  He tried to run away towards the gate.  I think from the gate to where he fell, I think it's about three or four metres.  He then fell and then other bullets followed from myself, Monwabisi.\n\tThe other thing, the people who were with me I do remember some of them but I don't remember others, it was myself, Thulani Mshlango.  If I'm not mistaken, Thlonono and Nkosana was staying in Mabuya but he passed away now.  But because there were many of us I can't remember all of us.  Unfortunately I don't remember the dates.  I don't remember the dates of the incidents or the time but what I can say is it was in the morning.\n\tSecondly, I'm also applying - if I'm not mistaken, Simphiwe raised this issue about the Dube incident.  I was also involved in that incident, when we were attacking there in the morning.  I am not going to repeat what he has already said. \n\tAnd other matters like the incident in Jazavu, in Mshayazafe, I think Mshayazafe is facing the dry cleaner of Osizweni then but it's not here now.  When we were going to that area, when we were about to reach Mshayazafe, before we got there there was a house that we used to use as our shooting range.  I think before the violence started the owner of the house purchased some bricks.  We would take those bricks and pack from the corner of the house to the corner of the shack and then we would open a space so that we can put in a firearm that we were using at the time.  Those are the things I do remember now.  That is all for now.",

When we were using Khumalo Street - during the day of this incident we were in our bases and while we were still patrolling we would hear that there would be people who would be jumped off by the Stability Unit in the corner.  Fortunately concerning this one, his jacket, the jacket that he was wearing, in the left-hand side of his jacket he had something on his jacket showing that he was with a certain group because a certain group would wear particular clothes so that you could see each other or identify each other so that you cannot attack each other.
