On that particular day it was a funeral of a certain comrade by the name of Stampu.  I could say the majority of the SDUs were attending that particular funeral.\n\tJust before they left their commander, Makasonke issued out an instruction that I should not go to the graveside because the situation was quite volatile and there were no guarantees that I was going to be safe, then he ordered me to remain and look after the place until they come back from the funeral.",

The situation was quite calm that day but I heard screams from the people, as well as some gunfire but because I had been left to look after the place and ensure the safety of the other residents, I went out to enquire as to what was going on and they said that the SPU was launching an attack.\n\tAs I was asking that question I was in Mbele Street where I resided, I crossed over to Givani Street.  When you are in Givani Street you are able to see or have a clear overview of the area as well as the oncoming enemy.  \n\tWhen I got to Givani Street and looked over Tshabalala Street, I could see the members of the IFP as well as the SPU.  They were dressed in red, some had red handkerchiefs, red bandannas as well as red T-shirts and the people now were fleeing for their safety and the IFP members were coming up Tshabalala Street.  That is the street where you can see clearly because it's a straight street and flat whereby you can see the enemy approaching, and down Tshabalala Street was an IFP stronghold.  As they were approaching they were shooting indiscriminately.  We could hear some gunfire and the guns were pointed towards us.  \n\tWhat shocked me even more was that they went around burning houses and leaving debris behind them.  As I had been given instructions to ensure the safety of the residents I also had an AK47 in my possession and when I realised that this was happening I had actually hidden my gun in the field and I decided to run and get the gun in order to be able to protect myself should I be attacked.  \n\tI went to Mkatizwe Primary School to seek refuge because this was next to Givani Street and in Givani Street you could also have a clear view of the oncoming enemy.  I got a place that I could call a cover.  I was able to hide myself but also keep a lookout on the enemy.  \n\tWhen I arrived there the gunfire went on and I could see some houses burning.  That was the aftermath of the SPUs.  I had absolutely no alternative and I just had to try and protect myself as well as the other members of the community who were not armed.  I fired my AK47, pointing towards the oncoming crowd.  Even though the crowd was quite some distance away from me, I was able to shoot.\n\tImmediately thereafter I saw the Internal Stability Unit who were actually escorting the group as the group went on conducting this reign of terror and the Internal Stability Unit approached.  I ran and ducked for cover because even the gun that I had fired made a loud bang that scared me and I fled the area.\n\tJust before I fired my AK47, I realised that amongst those who had gone to the funeral who were in the family car, had already come back from the graveside and Stambu was inside that family car.  Stambu came to me at Mkatizwe Primary School.  He told me that the situation is bad out there and we fled the area.",
