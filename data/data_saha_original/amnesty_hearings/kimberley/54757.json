I referred yesterday to various statements made by Mr Mbatwa who is one of the gentlemen currently imprisoned.  We were informed by the TRC that only Mr Nkotla applied for amnesty.  It appears from the documentation in front of us on page 58 and 59, that is the thicker bundle, last paragraph before the heading: \"Perpetrators\", the complainant Sipho Moses Mbatwa has also applied for amnesty on the first of June 1996 but as he states that he's not guilty of the crime, the Amnesty Committee replied in a letter that his case was out of the mandate, that is also repeated on page 59.\n\tIn the light of the importance of Mr Mbatwa statements, we believe that it would be important to have access to this particular document.  Furthermore it transpires from the evidence that Mr Mbatwa admitted to possession of a hand grenade, he was charged for that offence, he was found guilty and he is serving a term of imprisonment for that offence.  That would then seem to be a crime of which he was guilty and for which he might therefore have applied for amnesty.  The question seems to be hanging in the air and I believe the only way to solve it would be for us to have access to that document.",

And if that - if you people want to do that you'll have to do it properly, you must then make sure that the people who compiled reports attend the hearings so that they can be at the disposal of anybody who wants to call them as witnesses.  \n\tBut I find the whole thing to be quite a suppressing thing and I never thought at the beginning that such reports were meant to be parts of the court documents except that it was to be a report to the Committee to tell us whether they found a witness at home or whether they were not there and the like but it's creating problems when attempts are being made to try and tender them as proof of anything without bringing those people as witnesses.

I'm trying to show that there were people inside the foyer too, that was to have been expected by Major Mbatha and that was probably intended by Major Mbatha when he planned the attack.\n\tThe only unfortunate incident was probably that the attack resulted in the injury and death of ANC members who participated in the march and not in the death and injury of people who were inside the foyer, shoppers in the shops around, employees and the clients of the bank which was also apparently on the same level.",

More detail will forthcoming in applications for amnesty by various commanders and combatants\"\n\tThere are two lists of armed actions attached to these submissions, Appendix 4 provides information on operations carried out by members of MK, arranged chronologically and according to the nature of the target in each case.

There are probably omissions and some mistakes may have occurred due to incorrect reporting or a range of other reasons.\n\tThe incidents and attacks listed in Appendix 5 fall into the grey are described above.
