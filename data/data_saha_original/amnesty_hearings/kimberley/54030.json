It came towards our direction, coming out of the stadium and at that time I was, we were on the left.  One company was on the left side and the other on the right side.\n\tCol Mkosana had three radios with him.  The first radio, he operated it with the helicopter and the other radio he communicated with Col van der Bank and the other radio he communicated with the company commanders.\n\tWhen this crowd was coming towards our direction, Col Mkosana contacted Col van der Bank and he told him that the crowd is coming out of the stadium and it was coming towards our direction.  Col van der Bank was in Parliament at that time and he was looking through the binoculars in the Parliament building.  Col van der Bank told Col Mkosana, asked Col Mkosana whether he sees a certain tree and then he said that if they had passed that tree, he must inform them.  \n\tIndeed the crowd passed that tree and then Col Mkosana told Col van der Bank.  He then said that we must fire them and then Col Mkosana called out and said:  \"Fire\" after the crowd had passed the tree.  He said \"Fire\" and the soldiers looked at each other.  Nobody started shooting.  He called out again for the second time and the soldiers didn't shoot.  We looked at each other.  He said that again for the third time.  At the third time he was shouting at us saying:  \"I am saying fire\" and then the soldiers started shooting because they were not used to that situation, that's why they did not shoot at first.  It was their first experience to shoot at the people.  That is why when he was saying fire, Col Mkosana and he was also speaking over the radio with Col van der Bank, I started shooting with the rocket launcher, left and right and in those rocket launcher, I shot pointing at the crowd.  What I wanted to do is that those people must turn back, they must not come to our direction and after shooting those two rocket launchers, I put the firearm in the car and then I sat down and the shooting continued with the rifles.\n\tSome of them fell down, some went back to the stadium and when they were in the stadium, he then said that we must stop firing.

It is common cause that this  resulted in the death of 28 or 30 people, Mr Chairman and therefore I can also refer the Honourable Commission to the evidence related by Maj Gen Marie Scholtzliech in this regard.  I refer the Honourable Commission as to the testimony - as to the deployment and circumstances that reigned on the 7th of September 1992 and that was given to the Honourable Truth and Reconciliation Commission by Maj Gen Marie Scholtzliech,  the applicant, in this regard, Col Mkosana and Maj Mbina.  \n\tAssociation with the second part thereof,\n\"Associated with a political objective, conflict of the past,\"\nit is common cause Mr Chairman, that that march was planned by the ANC/SACP and Cosatu Alliance and it is common cause, according to the applicant, that it was the instructions from their Intelligence Unit that it was for the mere fact to take over the Ciskeian State or Government.\n\tI refer the Honourable Commission to Exhibit number A which is before the Honourable Commission again as well as the testimony before the Truth Commission in this regard, therefore it's my humble submission, Mr Chairman, that this application indeed also complies with (1)(b) of the Act.  \n\tThis argument is not bound or limited to this, is not limited to this and I refer the Honourable Commission to all the other reports, namely the Picard, Goldstone and Independent Board of Inquiry as well as the Ciskei Defence Force Board of Inquiry which was assembled for the purpose of investigating this matter.  \tThat leaves us lastly, Mr Chairman, with the applicant has to make a full disclosure of all relevant facts.

Now it's debatable as to the question whether Rifleman Gonya, in the same Buffel, would have heard the same shots.  Now with all due respect, we're working with human beings here, Mr Commissioner.  The one in his heart believes that he heard some shots and he conveyed that to his superior.  The other person in this same situation said no, he did not hear any shots at all.  It's my humble submission that in these circumstances, that it could not be argued that Col Mkosana in his right mind believed that when he said he heard shots, that there were no shots, just because Rifleman Gonya said he didn't hear shots.\n\tFurthermore concerning the radio communication, it was specifically asked to Rifleman Gonya during cross-examination as to certain aspects of the conversation he heard and he related to the Commission.  Certain aspects he was still sitting in the same position as to where he was previously seated and he did not hear that discussion.  I refer the Honourable Commission tot the specific situation where this - it was reported that some Rifleman was shot, that he didn't hear that clearly, he didn't hear where he was shot or how it came about, but he heard that if the crowd was past the trees, then you should shoot.  It's highly unlikely that if - or that even shows the same as previously, that if he hears this, but he doesn't hear the shot, therefore it is my humble submission, Mr Commissioner, that that aspect has to be dealt with in the situation as - that is how it prevailed according to this specific witness.\n\tAs to proportionality to the force, it's indicated, Mr Chairman, that the situation that prevailed was that this crowd was storming to this Buffel and the question was put to the Commissioner, to Mr Gonya, and asked:  \"What would have happened if you did not obey the order that was given to you?\"  And he indicated that he would not have been alive or sitting here today and that pertains to the question that it, in my mind and it's my humble submission that the crowd was approaching at the speed that they did not know what was going to happen and they were fearing for their lives and therefore it's my humble submission that the force in this instance that was used, was the force that they in their minds, on the date of the incident, portrayed as being the necessary force to avert this action of the crowd, Mr Commissioner.",

All I'm trying to say, Mr Commissioner is that he has been truthful to the Commission and he has not been criticised on his evidence at all and at the end of the day, the question is whether he did take an order from Mr Mkosana.  Now it was never put to him that:  \"You were never ordered by Mr Mkosana to shoot.\"  It was - all that was put to him was whether there are specific instructions for the rocket launcher to be used and he's saying in that situation it would not apply because we were not attacking the house, we were not attacking a running car which would be the situation under which you get a specific command to use the rocket launcher.  At the time they left the army base and at the time they were on the scene, it was known that they'll be dealing with crowds of people.\n\tThe rocket launcher was taken to the scene knowing full well that they'll be dealing with crowds of people.  Now how then is it expected for him not to shoot when there is an order to do so because a specific order regarding to a house or a car should be issued.  There was no situation that that order could be issued, therefore he has covered his back by shooting because had he not shot and something happened, it would be said somebody had a rocket launcher and was assigned to use it and he didn't use it.  He found himself, Mr Chairman, in a very difficult position, let me say, but after having said that the other aspect I wish to bring to the Commission is the fact that it is said he acted unlawful in the circumstances, that's what Mr Mkosana is saying, but Mr Mkosana was a Colonel, he does not make a report to the relevant army personnel so that the law can take it's course.  He does not do that.  He makes an oral representation, reporting about the incident to his senior but he does not follow the proper army channels to have Mr Gonya charged.  Now with that, Mr Chairman, it is very clear and it is very clear on what my learned friend, Mr Mike Smith pointed out, that there was a cover-up on this incident on prior Commissions as to what actually happened and that is why he was not charged, because there was nothing at that stage which said that he committed something unlawful.  It's only now that people are running away from the responsibility.

He submitted evidence in regard to the order given and the delay in carrying out this order which is the first time that it's been submitted before any Inquiry and in respect of his evidence that he fired the grenade or he fired the two grenades into the ground, there is in volume 2, no bundle 1 page 309, there is an annexure to a draft indictment which shows that a Mr Gola died as a result of shrapnel wounds.\n\tMy submission is, Commissioners, that Mr Gonya fired this grenade launcher without any order, maybe he may have been panicked, but he did not receive any order to fire it and that he is not accordingly afforded, or that he has not complied with the provisions of Section and especially Section 20(ii).  \t\n\tIn respect of Mr Mkosana, my submission is, Commissioners, that firstly the Defence Force covered up what was happening.  Mr Gonya was not called, they were fully aware of who had the rocket launchers from his evidence.  He was not called and that was quite clearly to cover it up.  When these two applicants were then advised at some time that they could face criminal charges, they decided to now disclose what had actually happened.\n\tIn respect of Mr Mkosana, Mr Commissioners, my submission is that in order for his action to fall within the definition of an act associated with a political objective, he must have committed it bona fide with the object of countering or resisting.  Now in his evidence he relayed to van der Bank that they were being shot at.  He was given an order to shoot back.  He then gives evidence further to say, on his own version, that he amended this order to say:  \"Use minimum force\", but then if he was bona fide in his action, before giving such an order, he should have ascertained whether shots were still being fired, because his order was in effect, if you are being shot at, shoot back.  It's an order to act in defence of their own lives, in self defence.",

No, this is a person who says:  \"I was a professional soldier on that day\".  This is his evidence.  He was acting as a professional, not as a person who could have been swayed by rumours or information that he received anyway whilst he was a professional soldier and on top of that the most senior person on the ground who had more than the responsibility of his life, he was responsible for all the troops that were on the ground at that stage, so my submission is that in looking as to whether could this man have thought that he's being shot at, this man that we're talking about should be classed as a professional soldier.",

That is if that finding is made.  Yes.\n\tNow, he  - I'm still on Mr Mkosana.  He states that he was in the immediate vicinity of Mr Gonya.  So does Mr Gonya's evidence corroborate that part.  Mkosana said in his evidence he was the only person who could order Gonya to use his grenade launcher.  He however did not give such an order.  In my mind it means therefore that he is then not applying for amnesty for anything that Gonya did, particularly because he did not make that order.  He also goes further that his order, the order to shoot, was restricted to the crowd within sight, within his sight, because this was the crowd that was supposed to be storming them and firing at them, which means that the order to shoot was restricted to this crowd.  However, people were shot at, people who were not within this crowd.  It is therefore my submission that he's not applying for amnesty for people who were shot elsewhere, at other places, or by other soldiers, because this is not the order he gave.  I realise that perhaps on our part we have not been very helpful to the Committee in terms of determining who and how many people were shot at in that particular area.  It is simply because, with the documents available to us, I could only see a list of people who were killed, but not be able to tell who was killed at what stage and perhaps finally one should add that if I say I didn't do it, it means I'm not asking for amnesty for it, you can't ask for amnesty for something you say you have not done.  \n\tSo my submission is that on all those instances where Mr Mkosana says he did not give an order, he should therefore not be granted amnesty for that and that is all.",

Chairperson, I've got only two issues to raise of and concerning the application by Mr Mkosana in particular.\n\tThe first Chairperson is the submission that Mr Mkosana refers to, that of I don't know, Major General  Ulser.  Chairperson, the essence of that submission was that he authorised the shooting to take place if they were shot at and that in itself, he was saying that:  \"If you are being shot at, then defend yourselves\" and it is in fact along those lines that Mr Mkosana instructed that people be shot at to defend themselves, now it comes then to a question as to what act or offence is it that Mr Mkosana should be granted amnesty for in the circumstances because he is coming to this Committee to provide this Committee with a defence of self defence against a possible \noffence and in a way it is my submission that he denies that he committed offences on that day, because he was acting in self defence or he instructed the forces to act in self defence.  The  Picard Commission Report, the Board of Inquiry and the Goldstone Report, do not take this matter any further as well, in his favour.  They just do not assist him.  He in fact goes on to say that he accepts, he does not accept liability for the actions that were committed by those soldiers whom he says he never instructed.  The only responsibility that he seems to be taking is the responsibility for the consequences of what he calls minimum force, which he claims to have instructed that it be executed.  It would be noted, Chairperson, that this minimum force, was described by the applicant quite succinctly and out of the description that he has given of this minimum force, it is highly unlikely, I submit, that the magnitude of these offenses where people died, might have been killed as a result of that minimum force which he claims to be responsible for, given the explanation that he gave this Committee of what the minimum force entails.

It cannot be said that these people died as a result of minimum force in the circumstances.\n\tAnother issue Chairperson I would address, is the question of proportionality.  We are dealing here with the applicants who were soldiers, armed, shooting at defenceless people, civilians for that matter, in what has been declared throughout South Africa to be a peaceful protest.  It must be noted, Chairperson, that the ANC as SACP Alliance, during that period, has been indulging in mass actions around the country and there has never been a situation where those mass actions, where the MK has been reported to have gone to attack people through what is called the marches, through those marches and even in Ciskei in particular, South African part known as Ciskei then, there were marches here.  In fact there was a march which was conducted in August that year, which did not get into Ciskei.  It was a peaceful march as well.  There was nothing which showed that armed MK was there to challenge the CDF then.  So I'm saying - the upshot of my argument is that it was unreasonable even for that intelligence of their's, to expect that MK would come and launch war in the area known as Ciskei then.  It's an unreasonable explanation to warrant the action that they did and especially given the fact that there was no war, it was a self-declared war actually, by the applicants and the Ciskei troops only, otherwise it was well reported that this was a march which was led by Clergy for that matter, the peace keeping force was there as well, of South Africa.  So I think that as well, Chairperson, ought to be taken into account by the Committee.  So in the circumstances it was highly disproportionate of Ciskei Defence Force to give live ammunition and to shoot at people in the circumstances of that nature.",

The applicant is coming here to say on the one hand, I did this thing in self defence, then I'm not liable, but if the Committee may find that I'm liable, then I apply for amnesty.  Chairperson, that is not an unequivocal taking of responsibility for the consequences that took place on that day and I'm saying, for that reason and that reason Chairperson in particular, he is not owning up to the responsibility of his action.  In fact that is not in accordance with the intention of this Act.  The spirit of the Act, Chairperson, for granting amnesty, is for the person who did that which is wrong to somebody, to come to this Commission and say:  \"I did this thing, it was wrong, I appreciate that, it was unlawful, it was a crime, then I apply for amnesty.\"  The victims are here to listen to that person who talks like that and that has not been the case here.

            "Yes, thank you very much.  That concludes the formal part of the proceedings, the evidence that is presented to us.  I think you would understand if I say that the matter is an extensive one, there is a great deal of material and information that we have to take into account in order to decide this case, it is not an ordinary matter by any manner of means and we have to look at everything that was said here to us and all of the things that were said before in connection with this case very carefully before we can decide the matter.  Our duty as a Panel is to decide the two cases that have been presented to us against what the law says.  There are clearly spelled out requirements that an application for amnesty must comply with, so what we have to do is to look very carefully at what was said and all of the information and to test that against what the law says the requirements are and if the application complies with the requirements in the law, the Panel is left with no discretion, we have to grant the application under those circumstances.  Conversely if the application that has been presented does not comply with the requirements that are spelled out in the law, we again have no discretion, our hands are tied, we must simply execute what the law says we must do and in that case we won't be able to grant amnesty, so that is the process that we must engage in at this stage which is going to be one that will take some time, it's very hard to say beforehand how long it will take.  We always try our very best under the circumstances that we work in, which is of course no secret, is highly pressurised and very demanding.  There are many, many other matters that we are hearing whilst we are considering the cases that we've already heard, so we have to leave here, we must look at this application, it is a very big one and most of us will go into new cases next week, which we must hear, so we must find time in between all of this, to sit down and to decide the cases that we've heard, so it is not a very easy and straightforward matter to do, but even within those constraints we always attempt our very best to give our decisions as quickly as we can.  We know that there are often very important consequences that flow from the decisions and it is important for the people who are involved in the matter to hear what has happened and to get finality on the matter.  We are very much alive to that.\n\tBut in all these circumstances, we are going to reserve our decision in this matter.  We will consider the applications and we will notify all of the parties, the legal representatives as soon as the decision is available in this matter, so we reserve the decision in the matter.  That also concludes our session, Mr Mapoma, if I'm not mistaken.",

            "Thank you very much.  Well then, I would just like to take the opportunity to first of all thank the legal representatives for assisting us in a difficult matter.  It always helps a great deal to have the assistance of the lawyers on all sides in order for us to eventually come to a proper decision in the matter, so we never underestimate the assistance that we get from the lawyers.  Mr du Plessis, thank you very much, Mr Nompozolo for having come in under some pressure and at the last moment, at least making it possible for us to continue with this application, otherwise the consequences of having had to postpone the matter are too tremendous to even consider at this stage.  We are indebted to you for that.  Mr Smith, for looking after the interest of the victims ad the interested parties and Mr Koopedi for your assistance as well and Mr Mapoma, we appreciate that and also for all the other people who have assisted us in being able to have this hearing here.  It is not an easy matter to arrange a hearing, particularly of this magnitude in any area in the country and we appreciate the effort that goes into arranging a hearing of this nature.  We always appreciate that.\n\tOur staff, interpreters, the proprietors of the venue, South African Police Services and of course the members of the public and the interested people, in having taken the trouble to come here.  Often it's not convenient to do so and it goes with a great deal of sacrifice, but it's important for the process that we are engaged in, for interested people and members of the public to see the process and to feel that at least it attempts to serve the interests of everybody, the applicants for amnesty, the people who are affected by the actions that were taken and in that process, moving the situation in our country forward, further away from the past, which we would like to close the book on as soon as circumstances permit, but we do appreciate and it's important to have your presence here as well and then finally to my colleagues on the Panel with me, for their assistance.  I am indebted to you.  We're adjourned.\nHEARING ADJOURNS",
