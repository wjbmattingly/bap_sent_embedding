The arrest while I couldn't personally say exactly I only read from the office because I went in 1979 there the Security Branch and I was able to discover that they were involved, especially Dean Farisani's file Posiwa.  I couldn't see much from Posiwa's file.  Or I couldn't see a file from Posiwa's side.  From then as we were investigating we discovered that there were some two people who went to Mr Posiwa's place who wanted some kind of help with regard to transport to the bombing of the police station.  Mr Posiwa then took them to Mr Mahamba at Kwendo area, from there they arranged to have a meeting and a van was provided to convey these people to the police station and it was also arranged furthermore that Mr Chikororo would be able to help with his kombi.  And as we discovered we realised that it was actually very true that Mr Chikororo's kombi was responsible and also Mr Ravele was responsible in helping, so was the case with Mr Poswana, he was involved with arrangement. As regard to Mr Dean Farisani it is true that I saw Dean Farisani at Louis Trichardt on the day that the incident took place.  We even greeted each other and we exchanged words to the effect that he said he was going to Johannesburg.  However as we were investigating or interrogating, these people confirmed that Dean Farisani knew about it, although on the day of the bombing of the police station he wasn't around.  He knew something about it, about the arrangement of the helping the freedom fighters.  It was then, in fact I can say that these people were arrested on different occasions.  What I can say just to add on that adding to the list from 15.1 Mr Mahamba was arrested and sent to Tzanani, I can't recall the dates exactly as to when was a particular person arrested.  Mr Mahamba was never charged as we know that he is a cripple.  As regards to 15.2 Phineas Mboleni Posiwa I personally assaulted him very much.",

Dean refused that of course he knew nothing, but of course I saw him in Louis Trichardt and then we exchanged words there.  As we continue there, I realised that it's better to intimidate him, because there was a boiling kettle, we pour water and then it was red boiling and then I said I want to pour water through is anus.  And then he said, \"No don't do that, I will tell you the truth.\"  Then he continued to deny, and then I shocked him with electricity, winding all over his body.
