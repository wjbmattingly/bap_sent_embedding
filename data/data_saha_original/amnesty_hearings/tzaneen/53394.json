            "Good morning everybody.  Today we were due to hear the amnesty applications of Brian Clifford Thobejane; Thomas Ngobeni and Donald Mukhawana, but unfortunately we have been informed that the notice, as required by the Act, Act no.34 of 1995 to be given to the victims of the incident was never received by them, and on following this up we have learnt that the victim indeed was in fact waiting for the notices in the expectation of attending the hearing, and is not available.  He is apparently out of the country.  So we are compelled, in the circumstances, unfortunately to postpone this hearing.\n\tOn the positive side we do have a fixed date for the postponement next month.  We are not in the situation where we usually are to postpone it to a date to be arranged because we will be coming back here next month.  \n\tSo we will not be able to proceed with the hearing but before we do the postponement I would like, please, to ask the legal representatives to place themselves on record.",

        [
            "CHAIRPERSON",
            "Thank you Mr Mbandazayo.\n\tThe date for the hearing will be the 30th of June 1999 at this same venue and we will start at either 09H30 if you can aim for that.  I apologise to everybody concerned about the inconvenience caused by the postponement.  As I say it was a matter certainly out of the Panel's hands here because we would certainly have liked to have proceeded with it today.\n\tBefore we adjourn I would also like to take this opportunity to thank everybody concerned for allowing us to have the hearings here this week.  We started here on Tuesday and I must say it's a very nice venue and we are appreciative to the authorities who supplied the venue to us.\n\tWe would also like to express our appreciation to the security provided to us, in particular Captain Mkushe and his team, as well as the Uniformed Branch and the Traffic Branch; the caterers who have fed us so well, and the sound technicians and everybody else involved - Lulanga, Ms Mtanga for the work that she has done etc, Ashley etc, thank you very much.\n\tSo we will then postpone this matter to the 30th of June.  We will also reserve the 31st of June just to make sure that we do not pick up a part-heard matter, although one, taking a look at the record, would expect it to be finished in the one day.  Thank you, and again we apologise for the inconvenience.\nCOMMITTEE ADJOURNS",
