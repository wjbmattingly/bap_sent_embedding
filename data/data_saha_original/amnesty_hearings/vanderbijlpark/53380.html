<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">ANDRIES MATANZIMA NOSENGA:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STRYDOM:</span> (continued)   	Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Nosenga, you testified last week that you fired many shots, what happened to the cartridges of the bullets that were fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So these cartridges must have stayed behind on the various scenes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The following day, that is the day after the attack, after you got up during the course of the morning, was there any trouble that you can remember or any threats or any strange thing that happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Would you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On the day after the attack, during the course of the morning at the hostel, was there any threats from any one for instance people that wanted to attack the hostel or things like that, that you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want to put to you that evidence was led already by the applicants that the following morning there was a threatening attack from people from Boipatong on the hostel and the hostel dwellers went out and before the parties could meet more or less in the vicinity of the robots, the Police sent the people from kwaMadala back and sent the people from Boipatong back?  So you have no knowledge of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On that following day, could you leave the hostel at any time if you wanted to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was afraid of going to the township or going to town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, but apart from being afraid, if you wanted to, could you leave the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.  I did say earlier on that I was afraid because these people were abducting us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On the 19th of June 1992, that is two days after the attack, could you leave the hostel if you wanted to?  Apart from being afraid, say for instance you were not afraid, could you walk out of the hostel if you wanted to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Would you please repeat the question leaving the hostel going to town or to the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question is if you had wanted to leave the hostel, apart from being afraid of the people who might kidnap you, could you go out of the hostel and go anywhere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I maintained that I was not able to walk freely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were you afraid of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was afraid of the people of the Vaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the only reason why you couldn't leave the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is the reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you see the Police arriving at some stage after the attack, at the hostel, that is on the days following the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I say I did not see them inside the hostel, I said I saw them outside the hostel, I did say that.  I did say that at the beginning of my statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you remember when you saw the Police outside the hostel for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> On the 18th, if I still remember very well, they were outside the hostel.  I saw them on the 18th, outside the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you remember approximately what time of the day did you see them for the first time outside the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I cannot recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> After the Police arrived, could you still go outside the hostel if you wanted to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I would not.  I have already stated that I would not be able to leave the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were you - let me ask you this, did you see if the Police searched the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did even though I cannot say exactly when.  They came into the hostel at night, they came in to search and some people were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> On the next day, the day after the attack now, was ntelezi used again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Ntelezi was used on the 17th, in the evening, when we came back from Boipatong, we used it, not on the 18th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And according to you, on the 18th, was there any singing and dancing or anything of the kind in the hostel by the hostel dwellers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, that happened on the 17th, in the evening.  MR STRYDOM:   Am I correct in saying that according to you, on the 18th nothing extraordinary happened, it was just an ordinary day in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, except that Themba Khosa came.  I am saying the one person who came on that day was Mr Themba Khosa, he came to fetch the firearm.  I cannot remember anything happening that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want to put to you that there was towards the afternoon after four o'clock, there was some sort of dance and ntelezi was used and the people sang songs, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I don't know about that, I don't know anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want to put to you that a video tape was made by the Police on the 18th, did you see that, filming the people of the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Maybe it happened, but I saw the Police outside the premises of the hostel, I cannot dispute that, but I am saying I saw the Police outside the premises of the hostel on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I want to put to you if one looks at that video, it is clear that there was singing, some sort of dancing and ntelezi was thrown over the singing people, but you didn't see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't know anything about that.  I only know of the meeting of the 17th, when we came back to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, could I just intervene at this stage.  We believe that there was such a video and it was an Exhibit in the criminal trial, and we have been trying to get hold of that, we were told that the Exhibits have all been lost, I don't know if my learned friend has recovered that video, and if so, we would like to see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Nosenga, to end off, I just want to put to you that you were not in the hostel during the attack and some time after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I was at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I haven't got further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STRYDOM</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is the next person?</p>

<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Nosenga, when first did you meet Mr Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did say that it was before I went to the hostel.  He once arrested me for a car offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question is when did you meet Mr Peens for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He arrested me for the first time  ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know when that was?  When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was arrested in Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What year, what month, do you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot remember sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you tell us what happened when Mr Peens arrested you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying Peens arrested me and he took me to Frogadien, Frogadien I am not sure if the word is correctly pronounced, in Vanderbijlpark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> This place, is it an office, can you just tell us what kind of building this would be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know, it looks like it is a place that they used to use for assaulting and torturing people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Were you assaulted during interrogation by Mr Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct, he assaulted me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> What did he do to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He applied electric shocks on me and he covered my face with a tube and he administered some things on my fingers, I don't know what they are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> If you say he administered electric shocks on you, can you just give us an explanation how did he do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying he put some wires on my fingers and I cannot explain how it worked, but it used to affect me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Were you blindfolded when this incident occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, because the tube had covered my eyes as well as my nose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> How do you know that he administered wires on your fingers?  Did you see the wires?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I saw these wires before he actually covered my face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> And when were you released after this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot remember, but yes, I was released ultimately, but I cannot recall when.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Was it on the same day of your arrest, two days later, a month?  Can you give us any idea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, I am saying I cannot recall because I was taken to the Police station where I was locked in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you remember whether you were released on the same day or the following day, can you remember that as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I think I spent a week if not two, I am not quite sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you ever appear in a court of law during that two weeks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I cannot recall.  No, I did not appear before the Court.  They just assaulted me and kept me for two weeks at Vanderbijlpark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> And where were you released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> In Vanderbijlpark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> At the Police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Before the meeting two weeks before the Boipatong massacre, did you see Mr Peens again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I saw Peens on the 17th and during the week, the two weeks prior to the attack, meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Nosenga, I have asked you before the meeting that took place two weeks before the Boipatong massacre, did you see Mr Peens again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I saw him on the 17th, during the day, he was actually giving Gatiza some money and I also saw him at Boipatong in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> So after the first arrest and the meeting, you never saw him again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Would you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Nosenga, after your first arrest by Mr Peens, and before the meeting that took place two weeks before the Boipatong massacre, you never saw Mr Peens again, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> At this meeting, two weeks before Boipatong, are you sure that Mr Peens was present at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I am sure.  I am certain I saw him at that meeting two weeks prior to the attack, that is the meeting of the 14th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> How do you know this, that it was Mr Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did say that I was not seeing him for the first time, you will remember you asked me when I met him for the first time, I told you how he arrested me.  I was not seeing him for the first time at the hostel.  It was the same Peens who was working for the Murder and Robbery Unit, he is the one who attended the meeting two weeks prior to the attack in the company of Themba Khosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Why do you say the person who arrested you was the same person who was at the meeting two weeks before Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I know Peens, it was Peens, he is the one who arrested me.  He was also present at the hostel two weeks prior to the attack.  He attended that meeting, so I knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> At this meeting, did Mr Peens at any stage address the people present at the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot recall sir.  I cannot recall whether he addressed the crowd.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you remember what he did at the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot remember him doing anything in particular, except that he was standing there with Themba Khosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Do you know the purpose why Mr Peens would allegedly be at this meeting if he said nothing and he did nothing at the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you remember who Chaired this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did say that it was Gatchene as well as other induna's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> In your statement, Mr Chairman, Exhibit R on page 19, paragraph 5, the second sentence starting with "Themba Khosa", and I will read it out to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>"... Themba Khosa and Mr Peens, a member of the Murder and Robbery Squad in Flora Gardens, Chaired the meeting."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't know anything about that, I only said that Themba Khosa as well as Peens were present at the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> So this is not correct, Mr Peens did not, and Mr Khosa did not ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is not correct.  I am simply saying they were present at the meeting, but the person who spoke was Gatchene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Do you remember if a person by the name of Danie was present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't remember Danie, I only remember Peens.  I only saw Danie for the first time during the attack on the 17th, in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Who is this person by the name of Danie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Danie is one of the Police working for the Murder and Robbery Unit.  I just know him to be Danie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> How do you know his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I used to hear people when they were talking, calling him Danie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Now, I refer you to paragraph 7 on page 19, the second sentence and I will read it out to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>"... Peens and Danie also said that they would supply Rooikop with weapons and he should give them to Themba Khosa, who would bring them to the hostel ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Sir, can you remember who took down this statement from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I cannot recall.  I did indicate that several people came to take statements from me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> If I put it to you that Mr Kjellberg took this statement from you, what would you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Do you know Mr Kjellberg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I am hearing the name for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Have you ever consulted with Mr Kjellberg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I cannot recall, there were many of these people who came to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Do you know a person by the name of Jan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> This statement was supposed to be taken by Mr Jan Ike Kjellberg, do you know if there is any reason why he would put down all of this information, which he didn't get from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying the person who was interpreting for me, was not doing a good job, and I had difficulty communicating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What language was this person speaking who was interpreting for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying he was speaking Zulu, but he was not fluent, because he was a Sotho speaking person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did the Interpreter - wait, just listen to the question before you answer it - the person who interpreted for you, what language did he speak to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was communicating to me in Zulu, but his Zulu was not fluent, he was not fluent in the language.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where does the Sotho come in then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying he said to me he is a Sotho speaking person, he was going to try as much as he could to speak Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you request for a Zulu speaking Interpreter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did.  I told them that I am not Sotho speaking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say that you corrected this person on a number of occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.  I was telling him often times to rectify mistakes in the statements and he would say he his sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you correcting his interpretation of what you had said to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.  Yes, I would hear him saying something different.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is what he was telling the person who was taking down the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> If I may Chairperson, you say you would hear him saying something different, what language was he saying something different in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was speaking this broken Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No you were speaking Zulu to him, he was speaking broken Zulu to you, you said to us you would hear him saying something different, he must have then been translating what you had said, to the person taking the statement, isn't that so?  Yes or no, plain and simple?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, yes sir, I cannot dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So the question is then, what language was he talking to this other person in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was speaking this English, I don't know and he would come back to me and he would speak in Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know the difference between English and Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> They were speaking English.  He was speaking English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I thought you told us earlier that you don't understand English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, yes, but they were speaking English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well, then how did you know that he wasn't telling that person what you had told him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The legal counsel used to look at the statement at the end of taking it, and verify it with me through the Interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is the position that the statement was read back to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He would ask me each time he was writing, whether it was correct, whether the statement was correct or what he was writing, is correct, and I would rectify him or rectify the statement along the way when the need arose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is the position that after you had spoken, this was interpreted to the person who was taking down the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then you would be asked by the person who is taking down the statement, who would read back what he has just written down, to confirm whether in fact this is what you had said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I would give him the information and it would be interpreted, written down and verified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And this happened from the beginning to the end of the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> May the question please be repeated?  May the question please be repeated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Chairperson, they are asking you to repeat the question, the Translators, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, what was the question, I can't even recall. MR LAX:   They were talking about repeating the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, you have been telling us that the person who was taking down the statement, after you had spoken, this person would confirm with you by asking you whether in fact that is what you had said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That happened throughout the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And as you were going along, was the statement being corrected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What I want to find out is whenever you made corrections, were these recorded down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I would see the person scratching out what he had written before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So he would scratch what is down, and write something else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And would he confirm whether that is in fact what you had said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what would you say, would you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, because he would scratch out some things, I would see him scratching out some things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, now when you told us that you corrected the Interpreter on a number of occasions, correcting his interpretation, is that what you were referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, because the Attorney asked me if the statement was as I told the Interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Nosenga, can I assume then that you reject the statement that Mr Peens addressed the meeting on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Has he not told us that that is not correct, hasn't he told us that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Excuse me Mr Chair.  In your evidence in chief, according to my notes, Mr Nosenga, you said the following, I don't know if you can remember</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>"... Peens said he will supply weapons, Gatchene was interpreting ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>	Can you remember that you testified to this extent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I said the person who addressed the meeting was Gatchene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> So this is not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, it is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you remember if a person by the name of Chaka was present at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No sir, I did indicate that he was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Once again sir, in my notes, in your evidence in chief, you testified that Chaka accompanied Peens to the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I said he was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Do you wish to change your testimony now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said Chaka was not present, I only met him on the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Nosenga, let's move on to the day of the massacre.  You said you saw Mr Peens again on that day, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did not say that I saw Mr Peens on the 18th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Sir on the day of the massacre, the day but before the massacre took place, did you see Mr Peens again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I saw him during the day on the 17th at the Iscor parking lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Was he alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I saw him, just him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> So nobody accompanied him, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I only saw Peens handing money over to Gatiza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> How do you know that Mr Peens handed money over to Mr Keswa?  Did you see this money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did see the money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> How much money was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> How did you see that it was money, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was close to them when he handed the money over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> How close sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was close, from where I am sitting it would be myself and Victor and Mr Peens.  The applicant pointed to his legal representative and Mr Strydom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> So you could hear, if there was any conversation between Mr Peens and Mr Keswa, you would be able to hear it, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I did not hear them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Was there no conversation between them, or you didn't hear them having a conversation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> They did have a conversation, but I didn't hear what they were saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, why couldn't you hear what they were saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> They were speaking in English therefore I did not hear what they were saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You did not understand what they were saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did not understand them.  Yes, I did not understand what they were saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Were you part of this what shall I call it, the group or was it you, Gatiza and Peens together when Peens was giving Gatiza the money because as you described it, you were quite close together, was it the three of you together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, there were three of us at the parking lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Where did Peens, did Gatiza know that he was going to meet Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know whether he knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you go together with Gatiza to Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was with Gatiza at the parking lot, we were just outside the hostel at the Iscor parking lot.  That is where Peens came to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  This meeting between Mr Peens and Mr Keswa, would you describe it as a private, secretive meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I would not know.  I do not know whether it was private or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Sir, if you were there, you would have known how the parties would act, would they act as if there was a secret between themselves, or didn't they care who saw them meeting with each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know sir, I have already stated that they met outside the hostel at the Iscor parking lot.  I do not know whether it was private, secretive or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Why did you join the meeting sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was in the company of Gatiza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did he invite you to the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He just told me that we should go to the parking lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did he tell you why you were going to go to the parking lot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, he did not tell me.  I just went along because it was my friend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> And now when you met Mr Peens, the Police Official, did you recognise him as the Official who assaulted you previously?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did recognise him, he was the same Peens who had arrested me, whilst I was still staying at the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> And you stayed with that meeting, you didn't go away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I remained there until Peens left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When Peens first arrested you, were you still staying in Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is what I said.  He arrested me in connection with a vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that is when you were detained for approximately two weeks from what you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, and the next time you saw him, was at the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, during the day and in the evening of the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Nosenga, this money, was it handed over in a purse, in a bag or just from one hand to another, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Peens removed it from his pocket and handed it over to Gatiza, but I do not know how much it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you remember if you saw the denominations of the money, was it ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I do not know how much it was, I just saw that it was cash.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you see if it was R50 bills, R100 bills, R20 bills, anything, can you remember anything about the money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did see a R50 note.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Only one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It was rolled up in a bundle, so I don't know how much it was, or how many R50 notes there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> So then there were more than one R50 note, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I don't know, I am not in a position to know, because it was rolled up so I cannot say whether there was just one R50 note or more than one.  He just handed the money over in that fashion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> It is still your submission or evidence that at the meeting present was yourself, Mr Peens and Mr Keswa, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Nobody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I did not see anybody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Sir, then I refer you to page 20 of your statement,  paragraph 10 the first sentence and I will read it out to you.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>"... I also saw Peens coming to the hostel on the day of the attack together with his colleague Chaka ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>	Now what is your evidence, was Chaka with Mr Peens or was he not with Mr Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I stated before that I only saw Chaka on the evening of the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> So you reject this sentence which I have read to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> You questioned me on who was present at the parking lot and I told you the people who were present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Sir, except for yourself, Mr Peens when he assaulted you the first time, or when he assaulted  you, you saw him at a meeting and then you saw him this time, were these the only times that you saw Mr Peens before the night of the attack at Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Then sir, I refer you to paragraph 10 again, the last sentence in which you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>"... I often saw Peens meeting Victor Keswa and I am sure that he got money from Peens."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>	Do you reject the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I do.  Victor Keswa received money from Peens on the 17th, that is at the parking lot but I do not know about the fact that he often used to receive money from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Sir, if I put it to you that Mr Keswa was in custody on that day, what would you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know anything about that.  As I said before, I last saw Victor Keswa on that day, I do not know what happened to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On what day is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> On the day of the meeting, the same day as ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The 17th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Sir, then I put it to you that it is my instructions that there never was a meeting on the 17th between Mr Peens, yourself and Mr Keswa, you are welcome to answer if you want to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just before he answers that, are you putting it to this witness that on the 17th of June, Mr Peens was in custody?  Mr Keswa, I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Keswa, that is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, okay, all right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know anything about that.  I will just not implicate Keswa and Peens falsely.  I did see him on the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> How late in the day did this meeting take place?</p>

Please explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I first rode in a casspir when I was investigated for those other offences and then the second time I went into a casspir, was when I rode to Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Du Plessis we know that he had been in a casspir before, let's move on.</p>

<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As we entered the township, we got off on the first street and took cover and other casspirs went into other streets.  We took cover on the first street and went into the first house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you give me an estimate if it was 100 metres, one kilometre, how far did you drive in the casspir?</p>

<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Du Plessis, the evidence from this witness as I recall it, is to the effect that it is Gatchene who issued instructions that they should get into the casspirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairperson, I would just like to know if there was any reason why they had to get into the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We know from this witness that Gatchene was in charge of the group, they listened to him, he said they must get into the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Nosenga, when you got off the casspir, did you see Mr Peens, what he did then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Mr Peens did not go into the houses.  What they did was to shoot at people in the street, we are the only people who went into the houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you keep constant eye contact with Mr Peens whilst you were on the ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, he did not get into people's premises or into the houses.  He was just, he just remained on the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Do you know if he wore any protective clothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I just saw him in his private clothes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you remember if he was camouflaged or if his face was camouflaged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, they wee camouflaged.  They had painted some substance on their faces and they were wearing balaclavas as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Then sir, how did you know that it was Mr Peens that was on the ground, from the casspir?  Could you distinguish between the Police Officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> How did you know it was Mr Peens, was there any distinguishable marks that you can know it was Mr Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I could see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Please explain how you could distinguish Mr Peens from the other Police Officials.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was wearing a white shirt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> What else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I saw him wearing a white shirt and a pair of jeans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Was he the only person wearing a white shirt and jeans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, other people were wearing pants, slacks and some were wearing jackets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Nosenga, I refer you to page 21 of your statement, paragraph 20 and I will read it out to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>"... Peens also shot people, he shot from the casspir.  I do not know what kind of weapon he used, but I do not think he used his Police firearm."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct, the casspir was driving very slowly and he was able to get of the casspir and shoot at people in the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The casspir was moving slowly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it was moving slowly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So Peens would alight from the casspir, shoot at people, go back to the casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is what I am saying.  After we had left the casspir, they remained in the casspir, but they would get off and shoot at people in the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr Du Plessis wants to clarify from you is the statement that Peens shot from the casspir.  Do you understand what that means?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that statement correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, it is not true.  The truth is that he would get off the casspir and shoot at people in the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you see if Chaka was around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> What did he do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was also shooting at people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did he also get off the casspir or was he on the casspir when he fired shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The Police would get off the casspir, I did not see them shooting from the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you see Mr Chaka get off the casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I stated before that Chaka also fired at people, you questioned me on Peens and I explained that he would get off the casspir, shoot at people and then climb on the casspir again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Nosenga, did you see what kind of firearm Mr Peens used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, it was a small gun, but I do not know what type if was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Was it a handgun or was it a pistol or - excuse me, a firearm, a rifle, anything an AK47, an R1, anything can you give a description, or didn't you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said it was a small gun, I do not know what type it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Nosenga, it is my instructions and I will put it to you that Mr Peens was never at a meeting two weeks before the Boipatong massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, I say he was present.  I would not implicate Mr Peens falsely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> It is also our instructions that there was no meeting between Mr Peens and Mr Keswa on the day of the Boipatong massacre.</p>

<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> And thirdly and lastly, Mr Peens was not involved in any way with the Boipatong massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He did play a role, he was involved in the shooting of people in Boipatong.</p>

Mr Nosenga, I am sure you are tired and you want to get out of the witness box, but I am going to ask you please to listen carefully to my questions and to concentrate on them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you remember when you were at Leeukop prison, there was a Prisoners' Organisation there that looked after the interests of prisoners?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If I give you the name of a person, Mr Efrahim Nkosi, does that ring a bell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.  No, I cannot remember very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am talking about the time at the beginning of 1996, approximately January 1996, you were at Leeukop at that time, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There was this organisation, as I say, and this Mr Nkosi was a member of that organisation, a representative of that organisation in prison with you at Leeukop?  Sorry, you said something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you approached Mr Nkosi for some assistance with your position, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it is possible, I cannot deny that, it is possible I went to him for help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, because this Mr Nkosi telephoned Mongezi, that is Mongezi Tshongweni and he told Mongezi that there was a man at Leeukop by the name of Mr Nosenga who needed assistance.  Now Mongezi was at that time, the Head of the ANC's Truth and Reconciliation Desk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is possible but I do not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga, let me just explain to you how it worked at the ANC very briefly, there was a TRC desk, in other words there was an office in the ANC that was set up to assist people who wanted to apply for amnesty and at that time, it was to assist ANC members who wanted to apply for amnesty.  Mongezi was the Head of that department, do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then after Mr Nkosi had spoken to Mongezi and Mongezi said yes, he would talk to you, then you called Mongezi, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the question?  I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying it is possible I called him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You say it is possible, but do you remember it?  Do you remember calling Mongezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying yes, it is possible, but I cannot remember when.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me try and help you Mr Nosenga.  There was a telephone in prison that you could use, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you needed a phone card to use that, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you didn't have to have too much money on your phone card, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And so you phoned Mongezi at the ANC, asked him to assist you, but you couldn't speak very long and he said he would get back you to after he took your prison number, isn't that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you now remember that you telephoned Mr Mongezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I remember now that he is explaining me and refreshing my memory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you asked Mongezi to come and see you at Leeukop prison because you wanted his assistance, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And indeed, Mongezi came to see you at Leeukop prison am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you told Mongezi when he saw you at Leeukop, about the fact that you had been convicted for killing people in Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you also told him when he visited you then, that you had participated in the Boipatong massacre, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also told him that you had been forced to confess to the Sebokeng killings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And we are talking now about January 1996, in that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then what you also told Mongezi was that you wanted to apply for amnesty for Sebokeng and for Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And also you will remember that you said to Mongezi that you wanted to appeal against your conviction for Sebokeng?  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But at that time, Mongezi said to you he needed to find out from the ANC if they could assist you because you were not a member of the ANC, you were a member of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he promised that he would come back to you with a decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then a little while after that, Mongezi came back to you at Leeukop prison, in other words he came to visit you again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I think he came, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Speak up so that we can hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I am saying it is possible he came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, let me try and refresh your memory if I can.  When Mongezi left you after the first visit, he was going to find out whether the ANC would be prepared to assist you in your application for amnesty for Boipatong and Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he was going to find out whether the ANC would assist you in appealing against your conviction for Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am sorry Mr Nosenga, then after Mongezi left, you phoned him again to find out what was happening and whether the ANC was going to assist you, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it is possible I called him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he said that the ANC would assist you, he would assist you and he would come back to see you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, when Mongezi came back to see you, he was accompanied by a woman, a white woman, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is possible.  I am saying yes, it is possible he was in the company of a white lady even though I cannot recall the name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Her name is Caroline Nichols, she came to see you with Mongezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is possible sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you told Mongezi and Caroline about your involvement in the Boipatong massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I want to object at this stage, my learned friend is putting the one leading question after the other.  Normally that is the right of a person that cross-examines, I will concede that, but if the cross-examiner shares an interest with the witness, so what he wants to hear is Police complicity, and under those circumstances, he cannot put leading questions.  I haven't got authority with me, but I am aware of certain authorities that state exactly that.  I will go a little bit further by stating that it has been placed on record that my learned friend, consulted with this witness, and under those circumstances, I will also say that he won't be entitled to put leading questions to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, do you want me to argue?  Chairperson, I don't share an identity of interests with this witness.  I represent certain victims of the massacre, this witness has been cross-examined on a statement that he made to Mongezi, statements which are before the Commission and I am attempting to ask the witness whose memory has been shown to be faulty, whether he agrees with certain evidence.  If he agrees with it, then there is no need to lead that evidence.  If I need to refresh his memory as is obviously the case, I submit I am entitled to do so.  I am not badgering the witness in any way, I am simply asking him in a very calm and ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The objection is that you cannot just read to him everything and get him just to say yes, yes, to everything.  I think that is the basis.  What do you say to that?  Because you might as well just hand him the statement and ask him to confirm that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If there is something that he disagrees with, then he will say so.  My learned friends, when they cross-examine the applicants for example, when Adv Pretorius cross-examined some of the applicants led by Adv Strydom, put leading questions to the witness, isn't that so, and there was no problem with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You just have to respond to what has been said to you.  Very well, no objection was taken to the others, here there is an objection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Chairperson, isn't it my place as the legal representative to object, whether the leading question is not being placed fairly to the applicant or not?  I haven't raised such an objection and I don't think, as the legal representative, I submit the question should be continued.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is your response Mr Strydom to what Mr Berger has said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson my response is that Mr Berger, or the people he represent, does share to some extent identity of interest and the basis of my objection is that if there is an identity of interest, then a cross-examiner cannot just put leading questions.  That is the first leg and the second leg, although he didn't get to that stage and I would probably object at a later stage if that is going to happen, if he is going to put certain things that happened during a consultation he had with this witness, but at this stage the objection is that, what I put is that there is in fact an identity of interest in that the family wants to show, to prove that the Police were involved, and this witness is saying exactly that in his evidence, and therefore I would say leading questions would not be allowed.  Chairperson, can I just add something ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom, we are mindful of the fact that the witness is being led, we are mindful of his answers to these leading questions, it seems to me that that is a matter that should affect the weight to be attached to that kind of evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes Chairperson, if I can just add one thing and that is that if certain allegations can be put now, what happened during consultation when Caroline Nichols was present, this objection will be the same because Caroline Nichols is a partner of the firm that represents the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We are mindful of the background to this case.  We are aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, could we take the adjournment now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you finished covering this point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, I haven't finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, just finish this point first before we adjourn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, it relates to the objection taken by Mr Strydom, could we please have an adjournment at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the purpose of the objection Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The purpose of the objection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The purpose of an adjournment, because I am giving you the opportunity now to round up the point that you have just canvassed so that by the time that we take the adjournment, you can move on to another point.  Unless you are telling me you don't know whether to continue with the cross-examination or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I just want to consider a position at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we will take the adjournment and come back at half past eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>ANDRIES MATANZIMA NOSENGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, it has occurred to me that Mr Mey who appears for Mr Chaka and the Police Officer known as Rooikop, was not given the opportunity to cross-examine the applicant.  What we propose doing is to allow him the opportunity to do so once the victims' representatives have finished their cross-examination.  You may continue Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.   Chairperson, we have considered our position during the break and we considered our position over the weekend as well, and we have also taken advice from certain senior Counsel as well, the allegations made by our learned friends for the applicants against us as legal representatives, are very serious although at this stage ... (tape ends) ... and it places us in a very difficult position.  It means Chairperson in our view, that we have to put a version to Mr Nosenga, our version on what happened, he can either agree with it, he can deny it, but either we must put the version Chairperson, or else we must get legal representatives for ourselves to put that version.  Our learned friends have not once come to ask us what is our version, what do we say about these allegations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This statement you are making, what am I supposed to make with the statement that you are making?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It is in response to the objection from ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I have ruled on that objection, but that the question is allowed, and that you will continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, also in your ruling you said that it will affect the weight of the evidence at the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Everyone knows that leading questions, if you put leading questions, whether in chief or anywhere, it is a matter which affects the weight to be attached to that evidence.  That is how one assesses the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes Chairperson, but I tried to outline the particular peculiar circumstances in which we find ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand that Mr Berger, and I have ruled that you can continue cross-examining this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> (continued)   As you please Chairperson.  Mr Nosenga, I want you to try and think back, I know it is difficult, to the time when you were in Leeukop at the beginning of 1996.  Do you remember how many times Mongezi came to see you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot remember very well.  Yes, he did come.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In order to help us go through this effort much more easier, just answer the question that Mr Berger is asking.  If you remember say yes, I do, if you don't remember, say I don't remember.   If you know that he came more than once, tell us that he came there more than once, but I can't tell you how many times.  If you know he came more than two times, tell us.  No one is going to hold you onto giving us the details of these visits, how many were they.  What you are being asked is mainly did he come there once, twice or how many times, do you understand the question, do you understand what is required of you now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Put the question again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I think he came to me twice.  I think he came twice, if I am not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was there twice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, at Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, what I want to suggest to you Mr Nosenga, is that he came more than twice, he came a number of times.  Let me tell you what I mean.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let us get a response to the first part first.  What Mr Berger is saying to you is this, you say if you think, if you remember very well, you think he came twice, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.  Yes, I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr Berger is saying is that Mr - this is Mr Mongezi right - Mr Mongezi came to see you on more than two occasions, what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot dispute that, it is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson his full name is Mongezi Tshongweni.  The first time he came to see you, was after you phoned him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then he came to see you with Caroline Nichols?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it is possible, I cannot dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At that meeting you discussed your role in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And in brief terms, I don't want to rehash everything that has been gone through before, but at that meeting with Mongezi and Caroline, can you remember what you told them about Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I think I did tell them something, even though I cannot remember exactly what.  I am saying yes, I remember I told them something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please speak up.   Do not swallow your last words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I understand sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I understand sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you remember talking about the involvement of the Police to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I told them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And do you remember talking about the involvement of Themba Khosa to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I told them that Themba Khosa came to the meeting, the meeting that was held two weeks before the attack and he was in the company of Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then do you, or let me ask you this, your application for amnesty which is from page 1 to page 7 of Bundle R, I know you can't read, but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I cannot read.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That application was completed also in 1996, do you remember who helped you to complete that application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't want to tell a lie.  I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If I tell you that it was Mongezi who helped you to complete that application, what would you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot dispute that.  I cannot dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That was Mongezi's third visit to you?  And then Mongezi visited you a fourth time, I don't know if you remember Mongezi coming with another man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry Chair, the response to the third visit was not interpreted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What do you say to what Mr Berger said that this form was filled out during the third visit by Mongezi Tshongweni to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I cannot dispute that, it is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then a fourth visit when Mongezi came with a man, a white man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga, if you don't remember, you must say you don't remember, but let me try and assist you.  This man came from the - hang on - came from the Special Investigation Unit in Pretoria and he accompanied Mongezi to come and visit you also in 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nosenga, you keep on saying it is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying it is possible, even though I cannot remember, I don't know who he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you remember that or don't you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot say I remember that, I am saying it is possible that Mongezi came in the company of this white person because many people came to visit me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now Mr Nosenga, I know that lots of forms and statements have been filled out from you, but I want you to try and focus on what I am going to say to you now.  Remember you told the Committee last week that you applied for amnesty long ago.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that when you saw Victor Mthembu on television, it was long before that that you had applied for amnesty, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now what I am trying to establish is what is your application for amnesty, and I will show you what I mean.  There is a bundle of papers there, Exhibit R,  and I want you to look at the first ten pages.  Pages 1 to 7 are the pages which Mongezi helped you to fill out and then you signed at the bottom of page 6, do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I can see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that you did in front of a Commissioner of Oaths at Leeukop prison, in other words there was a prison official who was present when you signed at the bottom of page 6?  Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I can see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you remember the circumstances around which you signed this document, it would have been in 1996, September 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> We went to Medium C, Leeukop, that is where this was completed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, you are correct, that is exactly what happened.  You see that on page 7, certainly.    Now in this document, you gave certain details and when you were asked for the acts, omissions or offences for which you seek amnesty, you gave details of the killing of ANC supporters in the Vaal Triangle, at the bottom of page 2, sub-paragraph 4.  I will read it to you and it will be translated for you, Mr Nosenga, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>"... I together with people mentioned in the document, I think it is annexed hereto, were involved in killing ANC supporters in the Vaal Triangle."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>	Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did say that.  I referred to the Sebokeng incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say there ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I did mention that, referring to the Sebokeng incident for which I was convicted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now also in that sentence you see there is talk of "a document annexed hereto."  Do you know what document was annexed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I cannot recall very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Right, then you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>"... the first incident was in a shack which was next to a road, ANC supporters were known to frequent that place.  We shot at people outside the shack in Everton."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Maybe there was a misunderstanding.  I am saying we started at Zone 12 and proceeded right through to Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, you have said that last week</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And it goes on to say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>"... the second incident was in Sebokeng, Zone 12 where we shot at people who were waiting for busses and taxi's (drive-by shooting) ...",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>	what you told us last week is that the second incident was first, and the first incident, was second?  In other words it was first Sebokeng and then Everton, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct, we started in Zone 12 to Zone 13, we shot people and we proceeded towards Sharpeville where we also shot at a taxi.  We proceeded to Jomo's Place in Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When it says here the first incident was in a shack, this was not the first incident, the first incident was the one that occurred in Zone 12 in Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The first one happened in Zone 12 Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The second one happened just as you leave Zone 12, we came across a taxi that we shot, and we went to Jomo's Place, a shebeen in a shack area.  That is in Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Okay, so there is talk here about two incidents, but the order is wrong, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, it is not a question of being possible Mr Nosenga, you are being asked a direct question about is the order wrong of these two incidents, it is not a matter of whether it is possible, it is either yes or it is no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, from Sebokeng right through to Small Farm and then Everton.  That is the sequence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga, that is why I have asked you please just try for a little bit longer to concentrate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And both of these incidents from Sebokeng to Small Farms to Everton, they all happened on the same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On the 15th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then you see there is another sentence here which I will read to you, it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>"... details of other incidents attached herewith."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>	Now, it is there, you can believe me that it is there.  Remember I asked you what was in the annexure and you said you didn't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I said I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Okay, but what I want to ask you is this, you have spoken about the incident in Everton, I beg your pardon, you have spoken about the incident in Sebokeng, Zone 12, you have spoken about Small Farms and Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I have to object against the Small Farms incident, it was not discussed, or he didn't say that as it is put.  Small Farms was not ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> He just spoke about it now Mr Lowies, two seconds ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry Chair, the way I had it is as follows, let me just clarify my objection.  My objection is he did not state Small Farms in his application form, and it is suggested to him that it was, and that is the nature of the objection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, let me ask you Mr Nosenga, what happened at Small Farms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> People were shot in a taxi that was pulling a trailer, I am also serving a sentence for that offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And in Everton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> People were shot at a shebeen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And in Sebokeng it was taxi's again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, at Sebokeng people were shot at a taxi rank, where they were waiting for taxi's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now in this sentence it says  ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me just get this straight, at Small Farms, is it Small Farms, you say people were shot at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, they were travelling in a taxi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They were in a taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And a caravan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying this taxi was pulling a trailer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, now at Everton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I shot people at a shebeen, called Jomo's Place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then at Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is where we shot people who were standing at a taxi rank, waiting for taxi's.  It is a place between Zone 12 and Zone 13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So Mr Nosenga, in this last sentence on page 3, paragraph 9(a)(iv), it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a>"... details of other incidents attached herewith."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a>	Now, do you know what these other incidents were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I only know of the incidents for which I am service a sentence, including the Boipatong incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, you see ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I only know of the incidents to which I have referred, not some of the incidents included here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You only know those that are mentioned here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I only know of the incidents pertaining to Sebokeng at a taxi rank, and Small Farms, the shebeen incident, and now you are asking me about additional incidents that are written here, I am saying I don't know anything about that.  Except for the Boipatong incident, I don't know of any other incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see Mr Nosenga, what you have just said is what I was going to put to you, that the other incidents include the Boipatong massacre, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct, I know about that incident.  I also submitted an application for amnesty pertaining to that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, and then at the bottom of page 3, paragraph 10(a) it says "state the political objective sought to be achieved" and you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>"... we were instructed by a Mr Zulu who was the Head of IFP at Madala hostel, Vanderbijlpark, to destroy ANC comrades.  He armed us with AK47's and pump guns."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Are you referring to the Sebokeng or the Boipatong incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I think this refers to Sebokeng, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct, he did instruct and he commanded that we should go out, but we did not get the firearms from him, instead Darkie Chonco is the one who gave us the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He also gave you pump guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I can still remember the AK and small guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I cannot say much about pump guns, because I don't know it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It says here</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>"... he armed us with AK47's and pump guns."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I cannot talk about the pump gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>"... details attached herein."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>	In other words what that means is that there is an annexure to this application.  I will leave that then.  You see, remember I asked you about the document which was annexed to your application form, which you said you don't know what was annexed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What I want to tell  you is that the document at pages 8, 9 and 10, which is the statement which was taken from you by Caroline Nichols and Mongezi Tshongweni during their visit, that statement is at 8, 9 and 10 and that is the annexure which is referred to at page 2, 3 and 4 of your amnesty application.  Do you understand what I am saying Mr Nosenga, or do you want me to repeat it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Would you please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What I am saying to you is the following, I am saying when Caroline and Mongezi saw you at Leeukop, Caroline took a statement.  This is the statement, 8, 9 and 10, this is the statement.  When Mongezi came afterwards in September, to help you with your application for amnesty, this statement at 8, 9 and 10, was annexed to your application form so that when you applied for amnesty, your application was for both Sebokeng and for Boipatong.  You are nodding in agreement, what do you want to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I applied for amnesty pertaining to Sebokeng as well as Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The statement, the unsigned affidavit at pages 8, 9 and 10, it is put to you that that statement, that affidavit represents a statement which was taken from you by Ms Nichols, I think it was, is that right, yes, Ms Nichols, what do you say to that, do you know that or do you don't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot say I know it, the lady came to take the statement, I have forgotten the name, yes, I cannot dispute it, but yes, it was taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... is a statement that you made to her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you see, I will just explain it to you a little further Mr Nosenga, that statement was typed up in June of 1996, right June, then when Mongezi came to you in September, about three months after that, he had this statement with him which he never asked you to sign, you are quite right on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He put the two statements together so that you could apply for amnesty for both Boipatong and Sebokeng?  What I want to tell you is the one is the statement and the other is the form for amnesty, your Attorney will show you what I am talking about.  That is the form, that is the statement and they were put together in September of 1996 and submitted as your application for amnesty to the TRC in Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me ask you this Mr Nosenga, when Mongezi left you for the last time, what did you understand that he had done for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I understood that he was assisting me to submit my amnesty application to the TRC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Amnesty for what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Because I killed people at Sebokeng as well as Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Okay.  Then I want to move Mr Nosenga,  I want to move from 1996 to last year, 1998.  In 1996 you were at Leeukop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And where were you in 1998?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was at Stofberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At Groenpunt prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is the one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Here in the Vaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, here at the Vaal or in the Vaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you were at Stofberg, did you know what had happened to your amnesty applications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't want to tell a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When was the first time that you realised that the Boipatong amnesty applications were under way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> If I remember very well, Mr Brian came to visit me in the company of Mr Berger saying that they had been sent by Mongezi to inform me that the application is in process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga, I want you to think very carefully now.  You were sitting at Groenpunt prison, Stofberg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And something happened which made, which informed you that people were giving evidence in relation to the massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.  I am saying Mr Brian informed me, I am saying Mr Brian informed me that my amnesty application is in progress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What are you saying?  Mr Brian came to you in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, he came to me in Stofberg to inform me that the application is in progress, that is what I can remember.  They told me that they had been sent by Mongezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who accompanied Mr Brian?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Before that Mr Nosenga, before you even saw Mr Brian and Mr Berger, you were at Stofberg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see something which informed you that something was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't want to tell a lie, I cannot recall.  I cannot recall what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I want to remind you about your evidence last week, about seeing something on the television, on the news.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I was in Stofberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All right, now what did you see on the news on television?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I heard Victor Mthembu testifying to the effect that a snake gives birth to another snake and that these snakes must be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you realised that he was giving evidence about what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> About the Boipatong massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And how did that make you feel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying there were Police when Boipatong was attacked, and I was involved.   They were not mentioning the Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me rephrase my question.  You are sitting at Stofberg and you are watching television and you see on the news that Victor Mthembu is testifying in his application for amnesty in relation to the Boipatong massacre, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you know that you have applied for amnesty for the Boipatong massacre, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you are not there where it is happening, Victor Mthembu is there, but you are not there, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So what did you do Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> After Victor Mthembu had rendered his testimony and when the TRC was sitting here at Iscor Club, I came here but - after Victor Mthembu had rendered his testimony, I cannot remember whether it was on a Tuesday or Wednesday, I came here but I did not come to this venue.  I think I spent most of my time outside.  I think I was outside in a Police kombi, that is where I spent the whole day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga, it was at this Iscor Club where you spent a day in the Police van, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But Victor Mthembu didn't give evidence here, you see, he gave evidence at the Sebokeng College of Education, it was on a previous occasion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I am saying he did not render his testimony here at Iscor Club, but at Sebokeng, I was not present there, I only saw that on television.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Right.   Now, what I am asking you is you see that the amnesty hearings are taking place without you, did you wonder to yourself why am I not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I wondered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what did you do as a result of that wondering, that is what I am asking you, did you speak to someone, did you call someone?  What did you do to get yourself before this Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I phoned and I enquired because the Committee of the TRC was meeting at Boipatong and yet I was not part of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who did you phone Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I phoned Patience if I still remember correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Patience worked with Mongezi at the ANC Truth Desk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were trying to get hold of Mongezi, were you not, to find out why you were not before the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But Mongezi wasn't working there any more, was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I was told that he had been transferred, I think he had been sent to Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And who had taken over from Mongezi, Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying it was Brian whom I was made to believe had taken Mongezi's position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You are quite right, it was Brian Mr Nosenga.  What did you tell Brian over the telephone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I found Mongezi, he actually phoned me back and informed me that he was going to send Brian and Brian came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But what did you tell Brian over the telephone when you spoke to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I told him I had submitted an application for amnesty pertaining to the Boipatong massacre because I was now concerned, the person who was handling this matter was Mongezi and now I was getting worried, it was somebody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And did you tell Brian that you had seen on the television that the hearings were under way and that you were not there and you were worried about the fact that you were not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct, I told him so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What did you ask Brian to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I spoke to him and I expressed my concerns to him seeing that I had submitted my application for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question is what did you ask Brian to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I requested him to come over to me and he promised, indeed he came.  He came if I still remember very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So, you asked Brian to come and see you at Stofberg, is that what you say happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.  Because he told me that he had been informed by Mongezi about my application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when Brian came to see you at Stofberg, he came with me, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And who else did he come with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot remember, except for Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How many of us were there who came to visit you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I only remember Mr Berger and Mr Brian.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you see my colleague sitting here, Ms Cambanis?  She is putting her hand up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I can see her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> She was with us when we came to visit you, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, yes, it is possible, but I can only remember Mr Berger as well as Mr Brian.  Maybe I just didn't notice her presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say it is possible, but you don't remember that she was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I can only remember Mr Brian as well as Mr Berger very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And did I tell you who I represented?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot remember very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You don't remember that I said I acted for the victims of Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not remember very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And did I ask you if you had a lawyer?  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, I don't remember.  There are many things that we discussed, because Brian was also talking as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If I were to ask you now who was your lawyer at the time that Brian and I and Ms Cambanis came to visit you, who would your lawyer have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying it was Mr Brian, because he had been referred to me by Mongezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what did we ask you about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I think you asked me questions pertaining to Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you remember if we had your statement with us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot remember very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you remember what we asked you about Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I think you asked me as to what happened at Boipatong and I explained, mentioning the presence of the Police as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it that we asked you about the Police specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, if I remember very well, yes, you did ask me that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And we asked you about Themba Khosa specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And we said to you that we did not want to ask you any questions about your specific involvement that night, what you did in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I remember.  I cannot dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What did you tell us that you wanted to happen, what did you say you wanted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I think if I still remember very well, as I was talking to Mr Brian, I indicated that I too wanted to appear before the TRC because I was involved in the Boipatong massacre, but I was not arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what did Mr Brian and I say we would do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I think if I still remember very well, Mr Brian indicated that he was going to inform me as soon as the hearing on Boipatong assumes.  I asked him or should I say I indicated to him that I would like to come before the Commission, because I was also involved in the Boipatong massacre where the Police were involved, and Mr Brian said he was going to get back to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Brian's full name is Brian Kupedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I think that is the one, but I just know him as Brian.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he came to see you with me and Ms Cambanis, it was on Monday the 10th of August 1998.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I said that is correct, because Brian came in the company of Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you remember that we told you when the Boipatong hearings were going to start again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> They were starting the next day, the Tuesday, the 11th of August 1998.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I understand that, but I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Okay.  And do you remember that we promised you that we would give your details, your particulars and your statement to the Amnesty Committee the next day so that you could be called to come here to be an applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot remember very well, so many things were discussed, I cannot remember very well really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, when we left you, what did you think was going to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I thought something was going to happen, I was hoping to be represented by Mr Brian because he had informed me that Mongezi had been transferred to Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were hoping that after we left you, somehow you would come as another applicant together with the other applicants, before this Committee where Mr Brian would represent you, is that what you were hoping?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it correct that we took down certain details so that you could be contacted, like your prison number, the name of the person at the prison who could be contacted, the telephone number of the prison, do you remember that discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, I am saying we discussed so many things, I cannot honestly remember everything that we discussed.  Yes, that is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What is the next thing that happened to you after our visit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I think it was on a Wednesday I came here in this area, this is where I met with the present legal Counsel, my present legal Counsel.  I spent the whole day in a Police van on the premises of Iscor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, Brian and I and Ms Cambanis, we came on the Monday and then you came here on the Wednesday, two days later, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga, I don't know if you will be able to comment on this, but just to place it on record that Mr Brian didn't have a copy of your statement on file at the ANC office, so he asked the TRC in Cape Town if they had a copy of your statement.  On the 27th of July 1998 this is before Brian and Ms Cambanis and me came to see you, the TRC in Cape Town sent a fax to Brian, or to Brian's office, containing a copy of your unsigned statement which is pages 8, 9 and 10 on Exhibit R as well as a copy of the first three pages of your application form which is 1, 2 and 3 of Exhibit R.  After that it didn't come out any more and that this was sent from the office of the Executive Secretary, Adv Martin Coetzee, to the ANC on that date.  You wouldn't have any knowledge of that Mr Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, no, I would not have knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, when you came to the hearings on that Wednesday in August, the 12th of August 1998, you say you spent the whole day in a Police van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, if I am not mistaken I spent the entire day in a Police van outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you saw your present legal representative, Ms Tanzer on that day, you spoke to her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct, I spoke to her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was there any television monitor in the Police van that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, no, I did not see it.  I was just sitting there, I did not see any monitor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And after that day, you were taken back to prison, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I was taken back to Stofberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you attend the hearing at any time during that session, I mean did you come back the next day to attend the hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot remember, I think it was postponed or something, I cannot remember very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.  You see what happened Mr Nosenga is that the hearings continued in your absence, you went back to prison but the applicants continued to give evidence during August.  You never saw that, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.  I saw it on television.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On the news?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, on the news.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the first time that you came to attend these hearings, it was not in this hall but in a separate room, that was during January of this year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.  I started coming here in January.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And would that have been the first time that you actually watched a television monitor, besides the news programme, that you actually watched a television monitor and saw the other applicants giving evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now before you came in January, do you remember that you were visited again at Stofberg, on two occasions by a tall white man with a moustache?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I cannot recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The first time that he came in December of 1998, he came with Ms Tanzer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the second time he came, he came without Ms Tanzer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know which prison you are talking about, was it Stofberg or which one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Stofberg, yes.  If you don't remember, you don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I cannot recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga, I want to just ask you a few questions about your evidence in relation to what happened in Boipatong.  Remember you - are you tired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I am not tired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you remember you spoke about a hostel in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is the hostel for the residents of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What I want to put to you is that it is no longer a hostel, it used to be a hostel.  It was situated along Mosheshe, Baralong and Majola Streets.  It is within Boipatong as you say, but it is not a hostel any more, it is part of the housing of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I don't know about that, I just know it as a hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Berger, can I just clarify something.  Are you putting it to him that it wasn't a hostel at the time of the attack or that it is no longer a hostel now?  I am not clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That it was not a hostel at the time of the attack.  It was formerly a hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Do you understand the question now?  Do you reply to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I understand.  I am saying I only knew it as a hostel because it is shaped into a hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It is what, sorry, I couldn't hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It has the shape of a hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you were tortured in relation to the shootings in Sebokeng, is it your evidence that the Police already knew about Sebokeng and were asking you specifically about those shootings in Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is what I said because I was arrested in Parys and I was brought here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> During that torture, were you asked any questions about Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I did say that they did not make mention of Boipatong, they tortured me pertaining to the Sebokeng incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did you mention the names of Papie and Mzwake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said last week that I was being assaulted and tortured by these Police and I decided that I had to protect myself by implicating these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who is Ruben?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He is one person who doesn't have an eye, he was here to testify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> One of the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see him on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> There were many of us, some of us took different directions, but one thing that I know that people who were residing in the township in the Vaal, people who had been residing at the hostel, people who had come from the township to reside at the hostel, did not remain behind at the hostel.  They were part of the attack, except for women and children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know who Makuka is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I know Makuka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who is Makuka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I know Makuka from Sharpeville.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see him on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't want to tell a lie, there were many of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Nosenga, if you were taken to Boipatong today,  or taken to kwaMadala and from kwaMadala to Boipatong, would you be able to point out how you got from kwaMadala to Boipatong and where you went in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I would be able to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you able to understand the photographs and the maps that were placed before you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, but then I could not make out the direction pertaining to the small houses, they are very small on the map.  If you can take me there, yes, I would be able to point out the route that we took from the hostel and how we entered the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And where you went in the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> After the attack on Boipatong, you told the Committee how you went back to the stadium, and after that, you went to Stikenauw's room, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was the feeling amongst you and your friends as you were in Stikenauw's room?  Were you calm and quiet or were you excited and hyped up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, we were excited.  That is where Stikenauw actually told me that he had raped someone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was it that same feeling at the stadium when you came back from the attack, that you were excited and hyped up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did say that when we went to the stadium, the same feeling prevailed, that is where we drank ntelezi to cleanse ourselves.  We put the firearms on the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As you were walking away from the stadium to the rooms, in your excited state, were you talking to one another about what had happened and what had happened during the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot recall, except what Stikenauw had told me in his room.  We then parted later, we parted so that we went to our individual rooms or separate rooms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But would I be correct if my understanding is this that you went to Stikenauw's room because you and Stikenauw and others, you were still excited and were still talking about what had happened in Boipatong, would I be right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct because he told me that he had raped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malindi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Nosenga, you testified about a garage that was burnt and you said it was burnt by members of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did mention that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And that is according to the comrades that detained you in that toilet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> What was your relationship with the people that it was said were responsible for the burning of the garage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> These people were my friends in the township.  I was not a member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> So your ANC background in brief is that you were friends with the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> In your application you state that you were a member of AmaButho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I said I don't know AmaButho, I was in a group that attacked Boipatong, I was a follower of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> It is your evidence that you were a member of Gatiza's gang, is it not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I used to accompany Gatiza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Was there only one such gang in kwaMadala or were there several?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying Gatiza and myself were friends, he had friends from the township, people like myself, from the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have just said that you didn't say that - you don't know AmaButho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I said I don't know AmaButho.  I am saying it is possible yes, there were AmaButho at the hostel, but I don't know them.  I would like the statement about AmaButho to be read to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is in your application which you signed, which you have now told us was completed by Mr Mongezi, in paragraph 7(b), you were asked the capacity in which you served in the organisation which you had mentioned as being the IFP and you stated that you were an ordinary member, a part of AmaButho in the IFP Youth Brigade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I dispute that.  Yes, I did mention the fact that I was a member of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say that you were part of the Youth Brigade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, the IFP Youth Brigade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were part of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I was a member of that, but I didn't have any position.  No, I don't know AmaButho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> In your application at page 13, paragraph 10(d)...</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Malindi, he denies that document, page 13 but please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Mr Lax.   Mr Nosenga, you testified that you went on a few attacks launched from kwaMadala, for example the Sebokeng attack, Small Farms, Everton and Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.  That is where I was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Do you know if other residents of kwaMadala were involved in other different, other attacks different to the ones that you were involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it is possible, but there were different groups and people would go out on their own as small groups, maybe they are involved, but what I know is that I was involved in the Sebokeng incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> I would refer you to Exhibit U and in particular page 7 thereof, paragraph 3 thereof if the Chairperson and the Committee members have that document, paragraph 3 thereof states the following in Afrikaans</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a>"... Op 15 Februarie 1992 is verdagte swart man Andries Nosenga, deur my gearresteer ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a>	If that date is read together with the statement that appears on page 1 of Exhibit U ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Chairperson, sorry for the interruption, may please the same line be read so as to be interpreted into Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> What appears on page 7, paragraph 3 translated into English</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>"... On the 15th of February 1992, I arrested a suspect, a black man, Andries Nosenga ...",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a>	and it is a statement by Mr Ferreira.  That date, read with what is on the statement which appears on page 1 and the statement that appears on page 4, is clearly wrong, it should be 1993.  Do you agree that you were arrested on the 15th of February 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, I was arrested in 1993, I do not have a recollection of the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Mr Malindi, the date on page 4 is the 15th of October 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Yes, you are right Mr Lax, I am sorry about that.  And also on page 1, it is also 15 October 1993, but on Mr Ferreira's statement, what then appears subsequently, it will be clear that the date of 15 February should have been 1993, because it then refers to incidents that could not have happened in February of 1992.  Chairperson, I will not take it further, the document is before the Committee if there is any point to be argued about when he was arrested and what the effect thereof will be, it will be argued.  Then lastly Mr Nosenga, when Mr Lowies was cross-examining you, he asked you a lot of questions about why you applied for amnesty for something that you have not been convicted for and questions to the effect why you apply for something that you had not been arrested for, or questioned about at the time of your arrest for the Sebokeng matter.    Do you know what will happen to your present imprisonment if you are granted amnesty for those incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Would you please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> You have applied for amnesty for the Sebokeng incidents as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> You are serving 14 years at the present moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> If you apply for amnesty and you are granted amnesty, what would you benefit out of amnesty being granted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Are you hoping that you won't serve the 14 years, you may be released before the end of the 14 years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And if you are granted amnesty for the Boipatong incident, what are you hoping to benefit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I was not sentenced for the Boipatong incident, but I was involved, that is why I have decided to come forward to apply for amnesty.  I will be very happy if I can be granted amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... is this, you are serving a term in prison, 14 years, for the Sebokeng killings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And if you are being granted amnesty in respect of that killing, you hope that you are not going to serve the 14 year period, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.  I say yes, that is possible because that is what I was convicted for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were not convicted of the Boipatong massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I was not convicted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are not serving any time for it?</p>

<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I knew him from the township, I do not recall just exactly where I met him, but he stayed at Zone 6 at Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was that prior to your residence in the hostel, in kwaMadala hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> How did you meet him in Zone 6, Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I used to see him around the township because I used to have relatives in Zone 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> At that stage, did you ever speak to him or had a conversation with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I just know him by sight.  I never spoke to him at that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> And at that stage, he was still a member of the Green Beans, the Municipal Police, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is what I knew him to be at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> We did not get the last part of his answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there a problem with the interpretation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> I do not think so, there was not anything said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nosenga, can you hear the Interpreter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I do.  Yes, I can hear her now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I will repeat the question Mr Nosenga, at that time he was still part of the Green Beans, known as the Municipal Police, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I said that is so.   He was a member of the Green Beans, but later on joined the SAP and then after that, joined the Murder and Robbery Unit in Vanderbijl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Do I understand you correctly that you also know, or are you in a position to tell this Committee when he joined the Police or the Police Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I do not know when he joined.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Did he join the Police Force long before the Boipatong massacre on the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, by the time the Boipatong massacre took place, he was a member of the Murder and Robbery Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Can you indicate, in months, how many months or years before the Boipatong massacre, he joined the Police, that means from the Municipal Police to the South African Police Services?</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot tell a lie, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Before the day of the massacre on the 17th of June, except for now knowing him from Zone 6, did you meet him at any other occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, when I had, after I had been arrested by Peens, at Flora Gardens, I said I knew Chaka from long ago.  At that time I did not even know where he stayed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> If you say after the time you had been arrested by Peens at Flora Gardens, what did Chaka do there, what did he do to you, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I don't remember what Chaka did.  The only person that assaulted me, was Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Peens assaulted you after you had been arrested, Chaka did nothing to you, that was your evidence prior to this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I said the person who assaulted me, was Peens, not Chaka, I do not remember what he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> If you say you do not remember what he did, is it possible then that he assaulted you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I do not remember, because there were other Police Officers who were assaulting me, but the person that I remember accurately, is Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Anyone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I said before, I remember Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Rooikop, was he present when you were arrested at Flora Gardens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Rooikop was present when I was arrested for robbery, but he was not present when I was arrested in connection with the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> So do I understand you correct now, he was not present when you were assaulted by Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> When I was arrested by Peens in connection with the vehicle, Chaka was the only person present, Rooikop was not there.  I only saw Rooikop when I was arrested in connection with robbery.  I did not see him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was Chaka present when you were arrested for the robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not remember.  But I saw him when I was arrested for the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> And Rooikop did nothing to you when you were arrested for the robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.  They were busy with other things, because I was not the only person who was arrested, there were other suspects that I was held with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> With reference to Chaka, after the arrest for the vehicle by Peens, when did you meet again with Chaka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I met him in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> On the 17th of June 1992, in the evening, that is in the veld.  We were in the company of Chaka and them as we went into Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Are you sure about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I would not fabricate these things, we did meet him on the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> But prior to the 17th, between the 17th and the arrest for the vehicle, you did not meet with Chaka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Are you sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.  I did not see him thereafter, until the 17th of June.  I last saw him when I was arrested by Peens, thereafter I just saw him on the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Rooikop, after his presence when you were arrested for the robbery, did you ever see him again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did.  I saw him on the evening of the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Also in the veld?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, we all went together to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Prior to the 17th of June 1992 and his presence when you were arrested for the robbery, did you ever see him between those two dates or incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I had seen him before when I was arrested for robbery in Flora Gardens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr Mey is asking you is you saw Rooikop at the time when you were arrested for robbery you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then you said the next time you saw him was on the 17th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What he wants to find out is between the time when you saw him during your arrest for robbery and the 17th, did you see Rooikop during that space of time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, the only people that I saw, were Peens and Chaka, but I did not see Rooikop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Nosenga, will you clarify to the Committee that your evidence during cross-examination when you testified, or cross-examination of Mr Lowies, when you testified that you did see Chaka after your arrest for the vehicle, being the time when you had been visited by Peens and Chaka at Vereeniging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, sir, I did indicate that Chaka and Peens visited me in Vereeniging, but I did not mention Rooikop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just a minute, when Chaka and Rooikop, did you say they visited you in jail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No sir, I said it was Peens and Chaka who visited me in the prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When Chaka and Peens visited you in jail, was that after the massacre, the Boipatong massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Thank you.  Mr Nosenga, the night of the incident, on the 17th of June 1992, prior to that you were told that the Police will give you some assistance with the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I do not remember, but the person who had been present at a meeting that was held two weeks prior the attack, was Peens and Themba Khosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> My question was, you were told that the Police will give you some assistance with the attack, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am not in a position to respond to that question, I do not know, but when we went to attack, we were in the company of the Police and they were in casspirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Did you ever see that Rooikop supplied weapons to Mr Themba Khosa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I do not know anything about that.  I have been questioned on it before and I have said the same thing before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> The night of the attack, 17th of June, the Boipatong massacre, when you met the Police with the casspirs in the veld, can you indicate the distance that the casspirs were away from the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am not in a position to estimate the distance, but they were not that far away.  That road towards Vanderbijlpark is not that far from the veld.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> When you got to the casspirs, where was Chaka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Inside the casspir or outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> They were standing outside the casspirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> What clothes was he wearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not remember well, the one person that I remember is Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was his face camouflaged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, he wore a balaclava, but he did not paint his face with any substance, it was only the white Police Officers who had painted their faces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> And Rooikop, where was he when you got there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was also amongst them.  I got into a casspir that Rooikop was also travelling in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> When you got there, was Rooikop outside the casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said most Officers were outside the casspirs, and I did not know some of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> But you do know Rooikop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did not notice him when I arrived, but when we got inside the casspir, I did see him there inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Where was he sitting or standing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was sitting at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Right at the back or in the middle of the casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was seated at the back, right at the entrance.  I do not know how to explain it, the others were seated in front of the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Who entered the casspir first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was it the Police or the hostel residents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I do not remember sir, I will not commit myself, but I also went into the casspir, but I cannot say whether it was the Police or the hostel residents who went in first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Can you remember what clothes Rooikop wore that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Why do you specifically know what clothes Peens wore that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I saw him, because we were in one casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> What was the clothes he was wearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He wore a white shirt and jeans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was it a long sleeve or a short sleeve shirt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It was short sleeved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Did he wear a jacket or a jersey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I just saw him wearing a white shirt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was he the only one wearing a short sleeve shirt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He is the only person that I noticed, I do not remember with regards to the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> You told the Committee the reason you know that Peens wore a short sleeve white shirt and a jeans, was because you were with him in the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I noticed him but I did not notice what the others were wearing.  If I had noticed what they were wearing, I would be able to tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> But that is my question Mr Nosenga, it is strange that you have noticed Peens' clothes, and you are not in a position to tell the Committee what clothes the other people were wearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I have stated before, if I had noticed them, I would be in a position to explain what they were wearing, but Peens was the only person that I noticed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Sorry, I don't understand you now.  Are you saying if you had noticed them, or if you noticed their clothes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mey, this is not - waste time on it, the man, the person that he noticed was Peens.  What else do you want him to say?  If he did notice the others, he would have told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Chairperson, if I do understand correctly, he testified that he noticed Peens and his clothes, but he also testified that he noticed Chaka and Rooikop in the casspir and if I do understand his evidence correct now, he also testified the reason for him noticing the clothes of Peens, was the fact that he saw him in the casspir.  My question now is if the other two were in the casspir, why didn't he notice their clothes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is it that you wanted him to notice?  He has told us that they were in the casspir, are you asking him why didn't he take note of what they were wearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have any reason why you didn't notice what the others were wearing who were inside the casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I said before, if I had noticed what they were wearing, I would be in a position to tell today, but the one person that I noticed, whose clothes I noticed, was Peens.  I just saw the others wearing balaclavas, but I did not notice what they were wearing.   Therefore I cannot say or try to explain what they were wearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Thank you.  What was the colour of Rooikop's hair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> White hair or blond.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I want to refer you to Exhibit R, page 20, paragraph 14, the last sentence thereof</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a>"... Rooikop had a very light complexion, almost like an Albino, red hair, thin and was about 170 to 175 cm's tall ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know about that, Rooikop had blond hair, he is thin, he does not have red hair, but blond hair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Did you, when you made this statement, did you also correct this when it was read to you or when it was interpreted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is possible that I was not properly quoted, because as I said before, the Interpreter did not speak fluent Zulu, but Rooikop has blond hair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> On the way to the township, Chaka and Rooikop didn't say a word, is that correct, on your version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I do not recall.  They were conversing, but I do not remember, I do not know what they were saying, they were speaking in English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Did they say anything, but you didn't know what they were saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> If they were conversing, I did not hear them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> When you got to the first house, you got out of the casspir with the other hostel residents, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Did you immediately enter the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, the casspir was driving very slowly and Peens and the rest of the Officers, were shooting at the people in the streets, while we went into the houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Who were the Officers who shot at the people in the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It was Peens and others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I can't hear a word.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Peter, we need another headset up here, there is a spare one here actually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Is that better Mr Lowies, can you hear us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> You said Peens and other Officers were shooting at the People, do you know any of the other Officers who shot at the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> One of them was Chaka.  I did say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Did you see Rooikop shooting at the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was not in a position to see the other Officers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was also going about my business and I would only see them if for instance I was coming out of a house or something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> The other people which were in your group, in the same casspir, the first house, did they enter the house with you or did some of them say behind in the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did say that it was three people who went into the house and others remained outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> What did the others do on the outside, shooting at the house or at the people in the street, or what were they doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mey, are you asking about the Police Officers or are you asking about the persons who were with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I asked about the persons who were with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please bear in mind that we have covered this ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Are you in a position to tell this Committee what the other persons in your group did, while you were in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I said before, the three of us went inside the house and others remained outside.  We went inside the house and started shooting at the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> The reason why I am asking you this is because you have testified that the others on the outside, were shooting at the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, I said the three of us went inside and others remained on the premises, outside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is being put to you and please listen to the question, what is being put to you is that you testified that whilst you were inside the house, the persons, some of the persons who were with you in the group, remained outside and were shooting at the house.  Did you say that or didn't you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He is not asking his questions properly.  At the first house, three people went in and two remained outside.  There were people who were fleeing from the house, from inside the house and these other two persons, were shooting at those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the answer to the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The only person that I saw shooting, was Dondo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is being put to you is that you told us earlier on that whilst you were inside the house, the people who were outside the house who were in your group, were shooting at the house, did you say that or didn't you say that?  If you answer the question, we will get onto the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> They were shooting outside, not inside.  We are the only people who went inside the house, the Police were shooting in the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was Chaka, when he shot at the people, was he in the casspir or outside of the casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said they would get off the casspir because it was driving slowly and they would shoot at the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> At no stage you saw Rooikop getting off the casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I cannot recall seeing him, the only people I recall are Peens and Chaka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, where did you see Mr Chaka when he was shooting, where was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> They got off the casspir, shot at the people in the street, and then returned to the casspir, he was outside the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> What I am asking, I am asking about Mr Chaka and in your answer you keep on saying "they".  Did you see Mr Chaka shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Where was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was outside the casspir, on the main street in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was he using a rifle or a handgun or what was he using?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know, but it was a small gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> When you got to the casspirs in the veld, you testified that the presence of Chaka and Rooikop made you think that the people in the casspir, were Policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did say so.  Rooikop was present as well as other Officers, including the one who was driving, whom I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Nosenga, through what door did you enter the casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The casspir only has three doors, two in front and one at the back, and I got in through the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> In cross-examination by Mr Lowies, you said the casspir had a side door and that that is the one you entered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, there is a side door, and that is the door through which I got into the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Where is that door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> At the side, as the applicant is indicating, the other two doors are in front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> If I understand you correct now, the casspir's got two doors in the front and a side door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It has two doors in front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And where is that door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot specify, but I know that it is at the side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is not at the back of the casspir?  what?  You are being asked now about the casspir and that is what we want you to tell us about, where is this door that you are talking about, is it at the back or is it on the side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is a side door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Except for the front doors, there is a side door and that is the door through which you entered, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry and is that side door towards the rear end of the casspir, is that what you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The door is on the side of the casspir, not at the back.  It is at the side of the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Towards the end of the casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it is possible that it is towards the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Nosenga, I want to clarify this now.  The casspir's got two front doors, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.  It does have two front doors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> That is right at the front of the casspir, is that correct, at the cabin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, the front doors are right in front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> You did not make use of that or any one of those doors, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I only used the side door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was there a back door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is on the side, I did not use the front doors and there was a side door which I used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> You have also indicated that you have driven in a casspir previously to the night of the incident, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is so.  I was taken in a casspir when I was being investigated with regards to the Sebokeng incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> It is the same vehicle as the one that you were in on the night of the incident, the Boipatong massacre, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it is the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I want to put it to you that a casspir has no side doors, except for the doors at the cabin, its got a back door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know sir, because I entered through a side door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is being put to you is that the motor vehicle described as a casspir, does not have a side door, it has two doors in front for the driver and the passenger to sit and then one at the back, do you understand that?  Do you understand what I have just described to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that the casspir on which you travelled, had a side door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it is a side door, next to the driver's seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> The colour of the casspirs were yellow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The casspir on which you were travelling, had a side door next to the driver's seat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it will be the driver's door and then the side door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just ask a question.  Apart from the driver's door and this side door next to the driver, presumably for the driver's passenger, did I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, as in a taxi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> There is no other door in this vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I noticed the side door, the one that I used to get into the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But there is no other door besides those two doors that you noticed?  Have I understood you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I only saw three doors.  The driver, the side door and the other one on the other side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Which other side, that is the whole question that we are trying to work out now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> There is a side door as you would find in  a taxi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And that is different from the driver and the driver's passenger, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The other two are the driver and the passenger's doors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So this door, similar to the one you find in a taxi, is that right next to the passenger's door like on a normal kombi, the front passenger's door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And that door is not near the back of the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.  Carry on Mr Mey.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Thank you.  Mr Nosenga, is that side door, is that then on the left hand side of the casspir, on the right hand side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know, I will not commit myself.  I cannot say whether it is the left or right hand side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> The roof of the casspir in which you were travelling, at the back, was it open or was it closed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you mean the roof of the casspir was open or closed, is this a convertible casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I will rephrase my question as follows Mr Chairman, did the casspir in which you were travelling, had a roof or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It had a closed roof.  On the sides, it had windows, but it was, the roof was closed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Do you know whether that roof can open or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am not in a position to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> The colour of the casspirs were yellow according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are back to that practice of mumbling, just speak up, we want to hear what you are saying sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, they were yellow in colour like the Police vans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Any other marks or stripes on the casspir that can identify them as a Police vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I just noticed the colour, the yellow colour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Apart from the yellow colour, are there any other  colour by which you could identify it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, it was just the windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> There were no Police stars on the casspirs, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Please repeat that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> There were no Police stars on the casspir at any place, which you recognised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It had a microphone that they used to communicate with, that is how I recognised that it was a Police vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Because it had a microphone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that was what the Police communicated with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was that microphone used that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I  don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Where did you notice the microphone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I saw it hanging on the roof, or from the roof, of the vehicle in front of the vehicle, inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> To get back to my original question, did you see any Police stars on the vehicle, any stickers or any other stripes except for the yellow colour of the casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I cannot recall, except that I could make out that it belonged to the Police, due to the window shields and its make up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> How do you recognise it as a Police vehicle due to the window shields?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Chairperson, he testified, he just answered the question by saying he recognised it as being a Police vehicle from the window shields.  What I want to know is, how - what is it on the window shields that makes it a Police vehicle?  Is there anything specific to the window shields?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Would you - this vehicle had a window grid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't he talking about, are you talking about the mesh wire that is on the side of the window?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it has something that is round like on the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> When the statement was taken from you, the one which you signed Exhibit R, pages 18 to 22, did you tell Mr Kjellberg that Chaka shot at people in the streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did.  I am saying there was a communication problem between myself and the Interpreter, but yes, I did tell him that he used to get out of the vehicle and shoot people on the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was that part of your evidence, what you were telling Mr Kjellberg, was it ever read back to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Mr Chairman, if I may, I think the applicant does not know who Mr Kjellberg is and if Mr Kjellberg was pointed out to him, he might recognise Mr Kjellberg.  The name Kjellberg is not a name that he knows or can identify with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The witness is being asked about the statement R18, which he has acknowledged to be his statement, that is what he is being asked about and I think I heard him say that I had mentioned it, there was a misunderstanding with the Interpreter.  What is the point you are making?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> No the point is, there are many references to a Kjellberg and I am just saying that Mr Kjellberg's name is not a name that he knows.  His name is not identifiable to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He has - this statement was never read to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> That is not what I am saying Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am asking you, is that what you are saying that this statement was never read to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> No, that is not what I am saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Even during consultation as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> The statement has been read to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Nosenga, was it ever  when a statement was read back to you, was it ever mentioned that Chaka was shooting in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know, but I am saying Chaka was shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> The reason why I am asking this, I am referring to Exhibit R, page 21, paragraph 20, and I am going to read it</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a>"... Peens also shot people, he shot from the casspir."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Peens would get off the casspir, walk on foot and shoot people on the street or in the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> It was never mentioned, or it is not in writing in that statement which you signed, that Chaka got off the casspir and shot at people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I had a problem with the Interpreter, because look, I indicated that the person who used to get off the casspir to shoot people in the street, was Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Nosenga, but you have also testified that you corrected them when something was written that was not correct, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was rectifying mistakes in several statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Several statements?  Is that what you are saying now, several statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> There are several of them, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> How many statements did you make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nosenga, what is being put to you is that you told us that the statement was read to you and that you corrected  anything that you didn't agree with in the statement as it was read back to you.  You did tell us that, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you have to correct this Interpreter on more than one occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> After it was corrected, was it read back to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> And were you satisfied then with the contents thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Why did you sign the statement referred to in Exhibit R, pages 18 to 22?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I signed the statement because I am applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> When the statement, Exhibit R, pages 18 to 20 was read - let me ask you this, was it read back to you after it was finished and written down or typed, at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it was read back to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Were you happy with it, with the contents thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Are you sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> But how do you explain then all these discrepancies in the statement, according to your evidence, that you gave here before the Committee which was put to you in cross-examination by various Counsel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Nosenga, all I want to establish at this stage is previously you said there was a misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He says he doesn't know, what else must he say now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I will leave it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is the answer to the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Nosenga, where - can I ask you this, where your evidence differs from the statement which was signed, Exhibit R pages 18 to 22, the correct version is your evidence that you gave here before the Committee, now what is written in your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is the evidence that I rendered on Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Last week Monday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> That was your evidence in chief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mey, the witness must be referring to the evidence that he has given us here, his evidence was not only given on Monday.  He has been a witness for the passed five days, this is the sixth day on the witness stand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Nosenga, when Peens and Chaka visited you at Vereeniging, where were you held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was held at the Vereeniging Police station, I was kept in a solitary cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> And they visited you in the cell, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, they came to me in the cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> And who did the talking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Peens was talking, I am saying Peens was saying that they were going to kill me in case I mentioned anything about the Boipatong incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was he the only one who spoke to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Chaka also spoke, Peens was not alone, he was in the company of Chaka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> What did Chaka say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was reiterating what Peens was saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was that all that had happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.  That is how they threatened me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> In what car did they come to the Police station in Vereeniging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know, I was incarcerated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You mean when he was held, when he was being held in solitary confinement, do you seriously expect him to tell you what car they came in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Chairperson, he indicated previously in his evidence that they arrived there with a Sierra vehicle, that was his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is being put to you is that previously you told us that they came to Vereeniging Police station in a Sierra?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No sir, I did not say that.  I said they came to me when I was arrested, I did not know what vehicle they were using.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I put it to you that you have testified that they came in a Sierra vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I was arrested, I could not have seen the vehicle they were using.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that you could not see in what car they were travelling because you were in detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I was in detention, I was in the Police cells, so I could not have seen the vehicle they were using.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I will leave it there, what I want to know from you is, at no previous occasion, except for the threat in Vereeniging cells, you were tortured by Chaka, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Would you please repeat the question sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Except for the threat after the Boipatong massacre at Vereeniging Police station by Chaka, you were never tortured by him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No,  was only tortured in Vereeniging and the people who tortured me were people from Houtkop.  The people who tortured me were the people who were in charge of my case in Sebokeng, yes, it Houtkop in Sebokeng.  The people who tortured me, was Chaka and that was the last time, here in Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Did Chaka torture you in Vereeniging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying they did not torture me, they threatened me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Did Rooikop at any stage, torture you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't remember him torturing me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I just want to get back to one point, now during cross-examination you said that Rooikop was not present when you were arrested for the car theft, whilst previously you testified that he was present, but he did not torture you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying he was present when I was arrested for robbery.  I said the person who was present when I was arrested for a vehicle, was Chaka.  Rooikop was only present when I was arrested for robbery and he did not torture me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Nosenga, you did testify that he was present with your arrest for the vehicle case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, no, I only spoke about Chaka pertaining to the motor vehicle offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> When Rooikop was present during the robbery, he did not speak to you at all, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This man did not testify that Rooikop was present during the robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I am sorry Mr Chairperson, when you were arrested for the robbery case and Rooikop was present, did he speak to you at all or at any stage during that happenings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't recall.  The one person who was busy attending to me, was Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> How many times did Mr Mongezi visit you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know sir, I cannot recall.  He did come to pay me a visit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> A visit or was it more than once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Haven't we covered that with Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Yes Your Worship, I am sorry Mr Chairperson, the reason why I am asking this is at that stage he was led by Mr Berger on how many occasions he was visited by Mr Mongezi.  I want to know from Mr Nosenga personally how many times he can recall Mr Mongezi visiting him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that relevant to the question whether or not Peens was present at the, during the Boipatong massacre, I mean whether Rooikop or Chaka was present during the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson, the reason for that being and I will come to it now, with reference to Exhibit R, pages 3 and 4 thereof, details of other incidents attached herewith, details attached herein.  I will get back to that now, I just want to know first, establish first on his version, how many times he was visited by Mongezi.  The reason for the details, it refers according to Mr Berger, to the statements and my clients have been reflect it in the statements, that is why I am asking this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you recall how many times Mr Mongezi visited you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I think he came twice to visit me, but then Mr Berger said he came more than twice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> The only reason why you say that he came more than twice, was because you were led by Mr Berger on that fact, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If I understand his answer it is that as far as he can recall, he came twice, but he cannot dispute the fact that it was four times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Nosenga, I want to refer you to Exhibit R, page 3, paragraph 9(a)(iv), the last part thereof.  It was covered by Mr Berger that the "incidents attached herewith, details of other incidents attached herewith" refers to the statement that was taken from you.  When you were cross-examined by Mr Lowies, you specifically said it refers to the incidents at Sebokeng and Small Farms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I am here for the Sebokeng as well as the Boipatong incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I understand that, but the reason why I am asking this is why did you at first say that it is only referring to the Sebokeng, Everton and Small Farms incidents, which was on the same day, the 15th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I also spoke about the Boipatong incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What you are being asked Mr Nosenga is, reference is made in your application to the details of other incidents and when you testified earlier on you said the other incidents referred to in your application, were the ones in Everton and Small Farms.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Today, when you were being questioned by Mr Berger you said the other incidents referred to in your application, are the ones set out in the unsigned affidavit, which included Boipatong, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> These are two different things.  The first one does not refer to Boipatong, whereas the second one you referred to Boipatong, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What he wants to know then is why did you tell us that it only refers to Everton and Small Farms if in fact it included Boipatong as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did say that this pertains to Sebokeng as well as Small Farms and the Boipatong incident.  They are saying this one particular statement refers to Sebokeng and the other one to Boipatong, really I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Mr Nosenga, I want to put it to you the reason why there are so many discrepancies in your evidence, it was put to you previously as well, that you were not there and you didn't partake in the Boipatong massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I was part of that attack, I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I want to put it to you that you are also implicating the Police and specifically Chaka and Rooikop falsely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I am not falsely implicating people.  Why do I choose to implicate Peens and Chaka when there are so many Police in South Africa?  I cannot just implicate people who were not involved.  I am saying this because they were present, this is not hearsay, I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Who fetched you from Parys when you were brought to Vereeniging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said if I still remember very well, the person who brought me was Chaka.  He brought me to Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was he the Investigating Officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.  There were people who were investigating this case.  Sixteen is the one who was investigating the motor vehicle offence and these others were investigating ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The name of the Police Officer is Sixteen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, Sixteen is the one who brought or should I say, came to investigate me on the question of the stolen vehicle, or the alleged stolen vehicle, my apology.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was Chaka involved in that investigation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, Chaka came to fetch me and he brought me here in Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> At that stage he was at the Murder and Robbery Squad, according to you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, in Flora Gardens in Vanderbijlpark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> On your way from Parys to Vereeniging, did Chaka discuss anything with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I do not recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Was he the only one who fetched you from Parys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I still remember Chaka, I cannot recall other black Policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Were they more than one Police Officers who fetched you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> There were three of them, I don't know the other two.  They were using a private vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> He didn't say anything about the Boipatong massacre on the way from Parys to Vereeniging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, he did not make mention of Boipatong.  He only spoke about the Vereeniging incident.  Peens and others only came to me when I was, once I was here in Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I want to put it to you that Rooikop, alias Mr Greeff or Mr Greeff alias Rooikop, was not involved in any way with the Boipatong massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't know about that, he was involved.  He was involved, Rooikop was involved.  I cannot just implicate him if he was not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Chaka was not involved in any way with the Boipatong massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't know anything about that.  Chaka is involved.  Why did I just choose to implicate Chaka and not others?  Why am I not implicating other Policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> I also want to put it to you that Chaka was not a member of the Murder and Robbery Squad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know about that, but I used to see him at Flora Gardens with the other Police Officers who worked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> When I was arrested with regards the vehicle.  I knew him to be working there at Flora Gardens, other people were also arrested and he was involved in their arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> During May/June 1992 Chaka was a member of the Green Beans as you called it, the Municipal Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know anything about that.  I knew him to be a member of the Murder and Robbery Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEY:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MEY:</span> CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chair.  Mr Nosenga, you will recall that during your cross-examination you said that you were staying in Everton prior to you joining kwaMadala hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did reside in Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And that you were staying with your uncle there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I grew up in my uncle's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> What is the name of the uncle, who is the uncle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> His name is Mude Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> The first name again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Nosenga, Mude.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Is the house you were staying in, his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When you left Everton, did you keep contact with him while you were staying in the kwaMadala residence, hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I could not, I was not able to go to Everton at that time, I only started communicating with him when I was in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Were you ever visited by any of your family members when you were staying in kwaMadala hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, no sir, they were frightened.  They would not have come to see me at the hostel because it was only IFP members who resided there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> You will remember when you gave evidence, you said your sister confronted you after the massacre about your participation in the massacre, which killed some of your relatives?  How did you communicate with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> She told me this when I was in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not recall.  I think she even visited me last month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Is she staying with your uncle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, she is married and resides in Bekkersdal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> What are her names, her full names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Nomvula Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now that she is married, what is her surname, married surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Her husband is Zakhile Latha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I would like you to clarify your arrest now in connection with the Sebokeng attacks.  Where exactly were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was arrested in Parys and I was transferred to Vereeniging, but I was arrested in Parys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Is that the arrest which was conducted by Chaka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Chaka collected me from Parys to Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And when you were arrested in Parys, were you arrested in connection with the motor vehicle or in connection with the Sebokeng attacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was arrested in connection with the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And is it out of that arrest that you happened now to be interrogated in connection with the drive-by shootings in Sebokeng and other incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is what I said.  Because it was just after the Sebokeng incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, when they came, when Peens and Chaka came to you in Vereeniging, can you recall how long after you were arrested, did they came to you now to threaten you about Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I cannot recall properly.  I cannot recall that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Are you able to say that at that time that Peens and Chaka visited you and allegedly threatened you, if you implicate them in connection with the Boipatong massacre, are you able to say as to whether at that time,  you had already  made a statement implicating Victor Keswa amongst others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I made the statement when I was being tortured by the Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When you made the statement as a result of torture by the Police, did you implicate Victor Keswa amongst others as your co-perpetrators for the Sebokeng attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No sir.  I only mentioned Papie and Mzwake, that is when I was tortured.  I implicated those two persons because I had suffered severe torture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did you implicate Victor Keswa at all in connection with the Sebokeng attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I only mentioned Victor Keswa recently when I applied for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did you mention him in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, the only people that I mentioned were Papie and Mzwake, but they were acquitted and I remained in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now when Victor Keswa died, where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I had already been incarcerated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Tanzer, any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MS TANZER:</span> Just one question.  When you decided to apply for amnesty for crimes that you committed, did you intend to apply for amnesty for both the Sebokeng matter and the Boipatong attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I think the rest of the question we dealt with in great detail and no more questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS TANZER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, indeed, yes.  Mr Sibanyoni, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Nosenga, if your uncle's surname is Nosenga, what is your father's surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> My father's surname is Ngoni.  Nosenga is my mother's surname, but my father's surname is Ngoni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And who is your mother's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> My mother passed away when I was very little, but I can get the name, maybe at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> As an IFP member, why did you prefer to contact the ANC when you wanted to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I could not have contacted the IFP, because I was going to tell the truth as I know it, and it was contradictory to what the IFP said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What did the IFP say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> If I remember correctly, the IFP - members of the IFP did not implicate leaders in such incidents, that is why I thought the ANC would be in a position to help me to apply for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> How did you know that the IFP did not implicate its leaders in the incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I have been listening to the media and TV, the radio, and the IFP leaders deny any knowledge of their members, an example will be Ndlandla, Buthelezi denied that he knew him.   That is why I felt that I would be put at a disadvantage, the IFP did not even come to visit me in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Before you even decided to apply for amnesty, are you saying you knew that the IFP was for example disassociating itself with the Boipatong incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is true sir.  Yes, they were denying that Themba Khosa was present when the meeting was held in the hostel.  Even now, they have not come to me, it is only my family who comes to visit me, whereas it is not them who had instructed me to go on that killing spree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Prior to making the application, did you know that the IFP disassociated itself from the Boipatong massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes sir, I did know.  I know that they deny involvement as they are doing now, people like Themba Khosa deny that they were involved, but they supported the people when they held those meetings when they went to kill people.  As I said before, I listened to the radio, watched TV, the news, and the leaders were denying any involvement.  It is difficult for them to admit that they were involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  I have finished, thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Just one question, you mentioned that when you left the hostel, you had to wear headbands in order to identify yourselves.  Some of the applicants mentioned that they were wearing white headbands, do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, we were wearing red headbands, I do not know anything about white headbands.  I only knew the red headbands that we were wearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Lax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one little aspect Mr Chairperson.  If I remember your evidence correctly, you said under-examination, you said you had Mr Peens in your sight at all times.  Did I hear that correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> How could you have had him in your sight when you were inside these houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> After we had shot people in the house, on our way out, I would see him in the street or getting into the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, the simple question is that if you were in the house, you couldn't have seen what was going on outside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is true, I would see him as I got out of the house.  I would not be able to see if I was inside.  I only saw him as I went out of the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The last question I have is this, you have now been asked about many statements, at least two statements before us and at least an application form.  Unless you are reminded, you have very little independent recollection of these documents, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> How were you able then to tell us what happened in relation to which document and who asked what questions and who did what and who corrected you on this or that?  How were you able to remember that detail and yet, you can't even remember these documents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I said before, most people who did the interpreting for me, were not fluent in Zulu, that is why I had to intervene now and then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, but I want you to tell me honestly now, you don't remember these statements, how therefore do you remember what happened when each one was taken separately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did say that I do not remember other statements, but I could remember some statements or the contents of some statements which is why I was able to say I corrected so and so here and there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have just told my colleague that the people who interpreted for you, could not speak fluent Zulu, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did most of these people, am I correct in saying that most of these people spoke Sotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And were you provided with the Interpreter at your own request or did they just give you the Interpreter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> They were just calling a Policeman to interpret for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you make it clear to them look here, I don't understand Sotho, I can't speak Sotho, I only speak Zulu, did you tell them that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did tell them and they also knew that I speak Zulu, not Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But at that stage, were you ever provided with an Interpreter who was fluent in Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No sir, they only provided me with those who did not speak fluent Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   Do you know whether there were people who could speak fluent Zulu who could have interpreted for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, an example as I said, there were people who could speak Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But nevertheless they were not made available to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, they only gave me a person who spoke Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  We were told by some of the applicants that shortly after your arrival at the hostel, you used to mix with a small group of young men who spoke Sotho, what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were born and brought up in Sebokeng, were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was born in Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In Everton, yes, very well.  What is the township there, is there a township there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is a shack area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that where you were born and brought up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did you go to school in and around Everton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the main language that is spoken there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is predominantly Sotho but there are also Zulus and Xhosas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you were not Sothos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, you have told us that, I think you were asked whether all the people who came to visit you whilst you were in prison, whether they came on their own without you having requested  to see them, and your answer was yes.  Do you recall that answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Today you have given us somewhat detailed telephone calls that you made to various people, requesting them to come and speak to you often concerning the Boipatong and the Sebokeng massacre.  Do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I think on your own, without anyone even asking you about this, you mentioned the name of Patience as being one of the persons that you spoke to on one of these telephone conversations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now which is which now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The truth is that I did phone Patience.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why then did you tell us that the people who came to you, came of their own accord without you having requested them to come and see you?  Why did you tell us that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> (No translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The ANC was being mentioned in this hearing and I only remembered when Mr Berger reminded me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is not correct that people came to see you of their own accord, you requested them, that is what you have told us?  I want to find out from you why did you tell us that they came to you of their own accord when in fact you know that it wasn't correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Since last week, the ANC has been prominent in this hearing and I was intimidated to speak about those calls.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you what?  Yes.  You were afraid because you heard the name of the ANC being mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were you afraid of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The ANC was being mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were you afraid when the name of the ANC was being mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It was be cause it was alleged that the ANC had planted me or had prompted me to apply for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do not understand what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The ANC's name was mentioned, therefore I was afraid to admit that Patience was called by me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You did not want to disclose the fact that some people from the ANC came to see you, is that what you are saying?  But if Mr Mongezi was an Attorney, that you have told us he was, why were you afraid to mention that he came to see you after you had requested him to come and see you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was assisted by my inmates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you yourself did not telephone Mr Mongezi, is that what you are saying now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did telephone Mongezi.   That is the - one inmate got in contact with Mongezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the first person who got in touch with Mongezi, is a fellow prison inmate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, the inmates I was with at Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, and then subsequent to that, you then spoke to Mr Mongezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what I want to find out is we know that it was one of your fellow prisoners who got in touch with them, why didn't you tell us that a fellow prisoner telephoned Mr Mongezi and as a result of that, I then also spoke to him?  Why didn't you tell us about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Many people, several people came to me and I therefore do not remember them all.  As Mr Berger was reminding me, he helped me to remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you had not been reminded that you made those calls, you would not have told us that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I would have not remembered because Mr Berger helped me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it was just because Mr Berger reminded you that you made these phone calls that it then clicked in your mind, yes, indeed, I did make these calls?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is not a question of you being afraid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I was afraid with regards to the ANC being mentioned, it was now alleged that the ANC was now encouraging me or had planted me in these hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just check this last thing with you Mr Nosenga, it is just arising out of the last set of questions and is it so therefore that because you were afraid, you wouldn't have mentioned anything about your calls to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I had forgotten about that, but I did contact the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> If you had forgotten about it, what was there to be afraid of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It was the mentioning of the ANC that they were the people who had encouraged me or who had planted me in these hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, you are missing the point I am trying to put to you.  If you had forgotten about these calls, you wouldn't have remembered that you had made them and you wouldn't have therefore had a thought in your head, that there was anything to be afraid about mentioning them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I had forgotten about it, and Mr Berger reminded me about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, I will leave it Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nosenga, we understand it has been a very long day for you, you have been on the stand for this, the sixth day.  Thank you, you may return to your seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is the position that we are now crossing to the victims?  Are you calling any more witnesses?  You don't have anyone else to call?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> No, that is my witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, all right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No Chairperson, that is not the position, I understood that my learned friend, Mr Strydom, was going to call a witness to prove the minutes of the meeting in Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that witness available now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I have in my possession an affidavit from a person by the surname Duma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Duma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, what are the full names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The full names are Thamsanqa Oswald Duma, with reference to the Ulundi conference, and I would beg leave to hand in this affidavit.  The next Exhibit number would be AA, if Chairperson is going to accept this.  Chairperson, as indicated only during the course of these hearings, at this stage we do not intend calling any witnesses, but if there is something to rebut, that comes out of the evidence of the victims ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, (indistinct) but at the moment, is that the applicant's case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is the applicant's case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.  Okay, we will address your application tomorrow morning, I see you have given us short Heads.  Yes, very well, okay.  Yes Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I am sorry Chairperson, I missed the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, this is the applicant's case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I also understood that Mr Peens, Mr Chaka and Rooikop had been subpoenaed to give evidence, are they not going to be giving evidence before the victims give their evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, then the victims will start leading evidence as soon as Mr Lowies has finished his application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.  We will adjourn until tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, can I just add something, there is a possibility of one other witness.  I have to take instructions, it is a very short witness, if we are going to call him, we will have him ready tomorrow, it is in connection with this Ulundi hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that going to be Mr Duma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, it is another witness, I have just been instructed, I think his surname is Twala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Chair, with your permission may I enquire which ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This affidavit doesn't say anything about the minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It doesn't state anything about the minutes, it is just stated that it is an open conference for anybody to attend and that is the purpose of this affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a>"... I cannot recall any participation by Andries Nosenga ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, that is what this person said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the value of this affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The reason why this affidavit was handed up is to show that it is open to any person, I will argue later on the basis that if any person of the public can attend this hearing, one would not have expected congratulations about an incident that took, an incident like Boipatong, that took place.  That is the value of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We have heard from the people who were there, I think what we were eagerly waiting for, are the minutes and someone to you know, to prove the minutes.  Because you will understand that once they were handed in, but there has been an objection, it is a document so far, which purports to be the minutes, so once there is an issue, then it is incumbent upon the applicant to prove those  minutes, you do understand that?  Mr Berger, that is the position of the victims, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> that is correct Chairperson, and also as far as this affidavit is concerned, if it is intended to prove the truth of the contents, we object to that as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I take the point, we will see what we can do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> We will inform you tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tomorrow morning at nine o'clock, we will start with the application.  Mr Mapoma, have you received the copy of the short Heads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I have received the copy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, has your team received this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We have Chairperson, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, all right, tomorrow morning nine o'clock, thank you.</p>
