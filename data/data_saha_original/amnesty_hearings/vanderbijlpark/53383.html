<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION:</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It has been brought to our attention that there is intimidation that is going on.  Some of the applicants have complained of being abused, some of the victims have been complaining of having been threatened.  I want to make it clear that none of this will be tolerated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	Whilst we do understand the background to this hearing in particular, that people lost their lives, their property, but let us not give anyone the right to intimidate anyone or to hurl any abuse at anyone.  We have requested the police to take up positions within the hall where they will be able to identify those people who are interrupting the proceedings and those who are intimidating or abusing others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>	If any person - and let me make it clear, regardless of who that person is, is found abusing anyone within this hall or intimidating anyone, that person will be removed from the hall immediately and everyone of those persons will be removed from the hall, and apart from being removed from the hall, the necessary steps will be taken against that person.  I therefore urge everyone of you to co-operate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	The proceedings have been jogging for a long time and therefore I urge each one of you to please co-operate so that we can proceed with these hearings to finality.  I also hope that your respective legal representatives have conveyed to you what I am now repeating to you.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	Mr Baloyi, may I remind you that you are still under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MACHIHLILE WILSON BALOYI:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Ms Pretorius.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Baloyi, you've been living in Boipatong for forty five years.  From your testimony it sounds as if you are one of the community leaders, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> And you're also a leader in your church.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> To which political party do you belong, Mr Baloyi, if any?  I'll repeat the question.  To which political party do you belong, if any?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was a leader of Shangaans in the Vaal area at the time when the Gazankulu homelands was in existence, from this area, including Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> What I'm referring to is say from 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was not politically affiliated to any political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Are you aware of it that the IFP was chased out of Boipatong?  People belonging to the IFP or who were supporters of the IFP had trouble living in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It did appear as if there was conflict, but I cannot speak on their behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> But as a community leader at least you knew what was going on in Boipatong, is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was clear that there were conflicts.  There was conflict between the ANC and the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> And this conflict resulted that the IFP members and supporters could not live safely in Boipatong, is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I think so, but it did not start there.  That was did not start there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I mean that there was this conflict because they felt that the ANC should not be dominant in the area, they wanted to be the dominant party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> But the question is, that as a result of this conflict the IFP members and supporters could not live safely in Boipatong, is that so?  It's easy, you must just tell us yes or no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> From 1990 until the night of the attack, were any of the IFP members that you are aware of, necklaced in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I did not hear of anybody being necklaced.  The only person that I know of was one who was burnt ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> That's what I mean, I'm sorry.  You did hear of a person being burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I did hear of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> And that person was an IFP member or a supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am not certain whether he was a member or supporter, but yes, he was in the IFP fold.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Do you know of any houses that were burnt down in Boipatong, that belonged to IFP members or IFP supporters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The one that I'm well aware of is the one belonging to Mtwana Zulu, but there were other houses that were burnt, the house belonging to people who were just supporters of the IFP, but not full members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> So their houses were burnt.  Do you know how many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I did not keep count, unless if I were to check from the book.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> So it was quite a lot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Quite a few but not too many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> The trenches that were dug in the street, which you helped to dig, was that then - the barricades that were erected, was that also to keep out IFP members from Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Chairperson, I'm not sure if the evidence was that Mr Baloyi actually dug trenches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought the question was the trenches that were dug.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I did say which he helped to dig.  I thought he said so yesterday.  I'll retract it and I'll rephrase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, you did testify that, as far as I recall, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Yes, he did.  These trenches were also dug to keep out not only the police, but also the IFP members, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> IFP people did not use Koyocos, they walked on foot.  Those trenches were dug to prevent police vehicles from moving about in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> And the comrades, were they appointed to keep out IFP members from the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, they were not instructed to do so.  Even now they are able to walk there freely, nothing happens to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I know now they are able to walk there freely, I know because we've been there, I've seen IFP members in Boipatong, but I'm speaking about the year or the two years prior to that attack.  Because there has been evidence to this Committee by the attackers, that it was not safe to go to Boipatong for them at all.  They could not go and buy food there, their children couldn't go to school there.  Would you agree or what would you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The children were able to go to school.  It was them who were fighting the people of Boipatong, and that is why they were afraid of entering the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> So the comrades saw to it that the IFP members did not come into the township, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We used to live amongst them, I mean IFP members in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Baloyi, I don't think you're answering the question, the question is, that after 1990, 1991 up to 1992 until the attack when the houses were burnt and people were, the one person that you know of was burnt, it was not safe for IFP members to come to Boipatong and the comrades were there to keep them out.  Do you agree or disagree with that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> So they could come freely to Boipatong, IFP members and supporters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Those people who were afraid of coming to the township were those who were involved in the fighting with the residents of Boipatong.  Nobody prevented or stopped them from coming into the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Why was Mtwana Zulu's house burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He had a fight with somebody else.  Nobody would have just gone out to burn his house for nothing.  Mtwana was a respectable person, he did not trouble anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> But he was a leader of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, he was, but he did not trouble anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> And that could be the reason for burning his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He is the one who can explain that.  Maybe he had a fight with someone on Majola Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Are you aware of it that from 1990 until 1992, that the South African Police went to Kwamadala Hostel several times to search Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Which hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Kwamadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not reside at Kwamadala, I cannot know about what happens there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Well I'm putting it to you that that is what happened.  Apart from you, you said yesterday you don't hate anybody, but was there a feeling of hatred between the ANC members and the IFP members in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The ANC is a big organisation, it is not a two people affair.  So they hated the organisation as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Who hated the organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am just saying that the ANC is a big organisation.  If two or three people within the organisation hates some other persons, you cannot claim that the entire organisation hates the IFP.  There was no trouble between us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> In 1992, before the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The problem was they tried to kill some people in the township, those people that they'd been involved in some conflict with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> So there was trouble in 1992 between the ANC and the IFP in the township, you would agree to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, we were attacked and killed as ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> That is before the attack I'm talking of, Mr Baloyi.  There was trouble in the township between IFP and ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There may have been problems that they may have to negotiate and solve.  I cannot comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Baloyi, the people from Kwamadala Hostel, were they mostly IFP members, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> You would not be in a position to know about people who stayed in the hostel because it was not near the township.  The people who resided at Kwamadala were mixed, some were ANC, some were IFP because they were all employees of Iscor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> When Father Patrick phoned you that night, that afternoon, why did he phone you, what did he tell you?  He said there's an imminent attack, but what did he want you to do, why did he phone you specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He should have called me, he liked me.  He a priest, he was involved in God's work and he was interested in the safety of all people.  He called me so that I could also try and take safety precautions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> What did he tell you to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He said I should be on the alert because there was an attack that was to be launched, nothing else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> He did not tell you to warn the other people in your street or other members of your church?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Because he called in the afternoon I only informed my family, I did not go out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Why not, Mr Baloyi?  It sounds so improbable that if you get a warning that you're going to be attacked, that you'll keep it to yourself, only warn your family to be on the alert and leave all your neighbours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I may have told a few people, but if I told five people, it doesn't account for the rest of the neighbourhood.  Yes, there were a few people that I told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Who did you tell, Mr Baloyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Do you want their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Yes, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I told about five people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> But I would like the five people's names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I cannot give you their names, because I did not enquire from them when I told them this information, they are just members of the congregation.  Maybe if Father Patrick testifies you can pose questions to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> But how did you tell these five people, did you go and see them, did you call them, what did you do?  How did you tell them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I did call them on the phone, but I was not specifically telling them about the attack, I just warned them about the possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> But if you phoned them, surely you can remember at least one name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I have children.  Do you want my children's names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I want to know the people, the other people that were not of your family, the members of the congregation you've just told this Committee that you phoned, I would like one of their names.  Preferably all of them, but apparently you can't remember them.  Can you give us just one name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was not just one person that I called, I called Shirley, Lizzie and Elizabeth, Betty.  I don't know why you want this information.  I just called those people.  These people are not the attackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Can you give me their surnames, Mr Baloyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you please give me the names again, you said it's Shirley ...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I called Shirley, Lizzie Tsotetsi, Gertrude Mbele, Joseph Mbele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> What is Shirley's surname, Mr Baloyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Tsotetsi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> And Betty and Lizzie, are they also Tsotetsi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Do the Tsotetsis all live in the same house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> And Gertrude and Joseph Mbele as well, they live in another house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, they lived in one house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Why did you tell me a minute ago you can't remember their names, because now you remember their names and their surnames, Mr Baloyi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was not important, it is not important because if you telephone a person you do not really concentrate on their name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>	I am here to testify about what I witnessed, not anything else.  I thought you're going to question me on what I witnessed, not about the telephone calls that I made, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Baloyi, just answer the questions.  I'm sure your lawyer and advocate and the Chairperson will stop me if they feel I'm asking you questions that I should not ask you.  So just answer the questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>	Was this the first time you had been warned about an imminent attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Do you have a motorcar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do have motor vehicles, not just one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Why didn't you leave Boipatong that night if you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do as I please, I cannot be forced to do something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Is it not so that you did not regard this warning as serious?  And that is the reason why you did not warn your neighbours and other people of the    congregation and why you did not send your family away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Do you want me to respond?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Yes, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know where I would take my children because I did not know exactly where the attackers were going to launch the attack.  If I had taken them somewhere it could have been that that is where they are going to be attacked.  Even if I was to inform other people from the streets, it would also have been, it would not have worked because I was not sure where these attackers would come from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Is that the reason you did not warn the people in your street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did inform some people, that was enough.  They were also going to inform others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> The question is, is that the reason that you did not think it was going to be in Boipatong, that you did not warn the people in your street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But he did inform some people and warn some people in his street.  He said that twice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He did not say it was in his street, Mr Chairperson.  I'm sorry if I'm wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>	Is that the reason you did not warn the people in your street, Mr Baloyi? - because you did not take it seriously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Is it correct that in Boipatong it was winter on the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't know.  Everybody knows that it is winter around that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Was it cold that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was a little cold, but I did not feel it.  I was on duty, I was keeping watch, on the alert.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> There were lots of fires burning in Boipatong that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not go around checking fires at Boipatong.  I would just concentrate on the fire that was lit in my street only.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> No, Mr Baloyi, I think you don't understand.  I'm not trying to catch you out, I'm just asking, I would just like some facts.  Normally in winter time there are lots of fires in Boipatong - don't talk about that night specifically, normally in winter time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Do you mean inside or out in the streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> What I want to get at, there is a lot of smoke in winter over Boipatong, like Vanderbijlpark likewise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what the witness wants you to do is to clarify the question for him, whether the fires that you're talking about, were they fires in the streets or inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I mean generally.  The fires inside and outside cause a lot of smoke in Boipatong on a winter evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> And that affects the sight of people in Boipatong, that you don't see as far and as well as you would on a clear summer night when there is no smoke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, it does happen from around 7/8, but around 9/10 that smoke will be clear. there will be no smoke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Because Mr Buwa testified ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He is here, he's listening to you as you speak.  I cannot comment on Mr Buwa's statements, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Okay, I'll retract that question.  What I want to know from you, did all your neighbours know Mtwana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There's not a single person who does not know Mtwana.  He was a good person and he  used to perform with the children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Did Mr Buwa know him, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, he knew him very well, he was our neighbour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Your other neighbour by the name of Victor, did he know Mtwana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What I'm saying is, Bafokeng Street, the people of Bafokeng Street, even the people of Boipatong in general know Mtwana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> So if they had seen him there they would have said so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I would not know about that, I can only comment on what I saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Did you hear any shots being fired at the Buwa household?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There was the breaking of windows in Buwa's home.  I was watching, I did not hear any gunshots.  I only heard gunshots at Nxwane's home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Can you give a reason if there had been shots at Buwa's house, why you wouldn't hear it?  You were watching his house, what is the reason why you would not hear gunshots if it was shot at his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But his evidence is that he was watching Buwa's house and all there was was just the sound of breaking windows.  He didn't hear any gunshots sounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairperson, I would just like then to put the following statement to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>	Mr Buwa says that he did, there were shots fired at his house, have you any comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is his testimony.  What I'm saying is that I did not hear any gunshots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> The people that were walking along Bafokeng Street, were they all carrying loot, goods that they had taken from the houses of the people of Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There was a large crowd of people.  I cannot comment whether each and every one of them carried something, but there were many TVs that I saw.  Many of them were carrying items.  I cannot really say if all of them did carry something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> You also saw them carrying it after they had left Bafokeng Street, going over the veld, were they still carrying these goods?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They would not have dumped these items in the township, they did carry them towards the veld.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> And you did see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> If somebody goes past you and you have their back towards you, how would you know what happens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> After they had left were there any TVs standing in the veld there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not go to that veld, I was busy with other issues.  The situation was very bad that day, you would not have been able to just go out.  Even policemen were afraid to walk around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Baloyi, the first time you realised that the people in the black clothes walking along the street with the balaclavas, the first time you thought they were white people was when the white man in the Casspir loaded the body into the Casspir, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I said so.  That is what I said yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> So up to that moment you did not think there were white people taking part in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did see the people in the Koyoco and I realised that they were white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> No, I mean the people walking in the street with the black clothes, that you said had balaclavas on.  The people in the Koyoco I'm not talking about, I'm talking about the people on foot.  The first time you thought they might have been white was when the white man wearing the balaclava came to load the body in the Casspir, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is what I said.  Even yesterday I still said the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> So the person saying: "maak gou" didn't really make you think that they were white, you thought it may be a black man that was saying this.  Because it's an expression used by English people, Afrikaans people, Zulu-speaking people, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I don't think so.  If an Afrikaner person says: "maak gou", you can understand or you can hear that this is an Afrikaner speaking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> But you just told us that you made the deduction that there were white people involved in the attack when you saw the policeman wearing the balaclava, after the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I said when I heard that voice I recognised that it must have been an Afrikaner and when I saw the person later on who was dressed the same way as those people who had been walking alongside the street, it certainly confirmed that indeed those persons who had been walking along the street on the sidelines were white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> That was not your evidence now, but I'll leave it at that.  Do you speak Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I do not know Afrikaans.  I can understand when you talk but I cannot claim that I know Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Do you speak English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am not English but I can understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Do you have any description of the man that attacked you in your house?  The lights were switched on, you were trying to keep him out of the room, can you give the Committee any description of that man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I'm not in a position to describe who they were or what they looked like.  They were in their private clothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> What kind of clothes did they wear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Do you normally wear glasses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I do wear glasses sometimes, if maybe I'm reading something, but I don't normally wear them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Because it's still strange to me that you cannot - can you tell us what clothing this person who attacked you with the axe had on, is it possible for you to tell us that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What I'm saying is, if you are involved, if you are being attacked you have no time to check what your attacker is wearing.  During fighting you cannot concentrate on a person's clothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Do you still maintain that you don't know the colour of the Koyoco that was parked in front of your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not want to commit to that.  As I said yesterday, Afrikaners are very clever, they respray these vehicles every day.  They would respray them every two days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> But that is not the question, the question is Mr Baloyi, what the colour was when you saw it, not what it was two days later or three days, that   night when you saw it what was the colour of the Koyoco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I cannot comment on it.  I do not want to commit myself, I just know that it was a Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Why did you not go and hide when the attack took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Hide myself, what for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> From the attackers, Mr Baloyi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They had attacked me.  I would say I could not have hid myself before the attack because they had not yet come to attack me.  I would have expected to hide myself at the time of the attack itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Well that's what I also would like to know, why did you not hide yourself because you hid your family, why did you yourself not hide?  You saw them at two of your neighbours and you did not hide, why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am the man of the household, I am the one who was supposed to take care of everything that would be a threat to the safety of my family because I had to protect my family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Is it not true that you did go and hide?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Because I want to put it to you that my instructions are there were no police taking part in that attack on that night and that your deduction after the attack is wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That's what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> My instructions are also that Mtwana Zulu was definitely not part of the attack and that you made a mistake when you thought it was him calling the names, because there were many people in that street that knew the children's names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> You are saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I have no further questions, thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PRETORIUS</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Yes, Mr da Silva?		     CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DA SILVA:   Mr Baloyi, I want to ask you a number of questions to clarify certain aspects.  During the attack or when you saw these vehicles, I understand your evidence  to be that you saw five vehicles in the immediate vicinity of your home, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, he didn't say that in the immediate vicinity.  I think there was one police vehicle in front of his house.  Two went down Umzimvubu and then all the way towards the robots and joined the other two which were at Metal Box.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I accept that, Mr Chairman, I put the question incorrectly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>	Let me ask you this, the vehicle that you saw in front of your house, I understand your evidence to be that it was a police vehicle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was not an ordinary police vehicle, it was a Koyoco, the one that is used by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Would you agree that your evidence is, and that's how I understand your evidence, that is was a police Koyoco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, a police Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Then you saw - did you see a police Koyoco and did you see a police Nyala approaching this police Koyoco in Amatola Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, it went towards Metal Box.  That is what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which one, you mean the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> And the other left Amatola and joined the others so that they became three.  They got off the vehicle and they fired in the air.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Yes.  Just concentrate on the question I'm asking you, Mr Baloyi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> My question was;  the vehicles that he saw in Amatola Street, was that a police Koyoco and was it joined by a police Nyala? 	You've corrected me, Mr Baloyi, the vehicles that you saw near Metal Box, was that a police Koyoco and was that a police Nyala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Then you saw two further vehicles travelling along Umzimvubu Street, which followed the crowd to the footbridge, were those two police Koyocos, is that what you saw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, two Koyocos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Right.  Now apart from the vehicles that you saw in Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, I'm not talking about those vehicles, you only saw police vehicles and you saw no military vehicles in Boipatong township, in the township itself.  Is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, the military vehicles were parked far away, there were only two of them.  They were near the gate.  I did not see them inside Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I understood your evidence yesterday to be that you saw these military vehicles in Frikkie Meyer Boulevard.  You're talking about a gate now, what do you mean by the "gate"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't understand now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Let me try and simplify the question.  I understood your evidence to be that the vehicles that you saw in Boipatong were police vehicles, they were not military vehicles, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Because my instructions are that there were no military vehicles during the attack in Boipatong, so you must agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Inside the township really I cannot say,  I only know about my position in Bafokeng Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Yes. I'm talking about what you saw.  You saw no military vehicles at any stage during the attack, in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Did you come with the other witnesses this morning in a bus?  I understand - or let me put it more correctly, did you come this morning to this hearing with other people in a bus to this hall, did you travel in a bus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, we came by bus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And I presume you got out of the bus and walked down the path and walked through this door into the hall, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Right.  Standing outside in the street were two police vehicles, did you see them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> What type of vehicles are those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is an Nyala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So that's a police Nyala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that's what I hear them say.  I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Yes.  Now you've testified for two days.  When you went home in the evening, on Tuesday evening and Wednesday evening, did you tell your son, the policeman, either Silo or Pitso, did you tell him: "These people are asking me a lot of questions about the vehicles, please explain to me how these vehicles, what these vehicles are"?  Did you have a conversation along those lines with either of your sons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not.  I just know that these are police vehicles.  I did not ask them the difference between these vehicles because they do not concern me, they are police vehicles.  I just know it is a Koyoco and this is Nyala.  I would have no reason to ask to what model or make or type this is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Very well.  You explained to the Committee that a Koyoco is bigger than a Casspir, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> A Casspir is a Koyoco.  The one that is outside here is the smaller one.  I said Koyocos are big and the smallest is Nyala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Your evidence-in-chief was that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>"A Casspir is smaller than a Koyoco"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>Are you changing your evidence now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Look I don't know the names.  They call them Casspirs, they call them Nyala.  I did say that.  The people who know these things are the police.  I suggested to you that you should go and ask my son, he is a police person, a policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MS BERGER:</span> Chairperson, with respect, I must object to this cross-examination.  My learned friend has cross-examined this witness to the point where his client is not implicated at all.  There's no point in this further cross-examination I would submit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairman, the version put by my client differs substantially from the version given by this witness.  I'm entitled to cross-examine him, with respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's hear your version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I will put my version at the appropriate stage, Mr Chairman.  I submit with respect that I am entitled to test this witness.  The implication of his evidence, Mr Chairman, is that travelling down Nobel Boulevard were three police vehicles, and I've already, or my instructions are that the soldiers never saw these vehicles.  So I'm entitled to test him to see exactly what he saw, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And in doing so, please do not cover the ground that we've covered.  He's told us repeatedly what the Nyala is and what he understood the Koyoco to be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairman, I'll ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he has repeatedly said he can't distinguish it, all he knows is that one is smaller and the other one is bigger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I undertake to be as short as possible.  I know time is of the essence, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>	Are you saying now, Mr Baloyi, that a Koyoco and a Casspir are one and the same vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I said to you the police and the soldiers, other ones will know of these names.  What I know is a Koyoco.  It is big and it has a roof door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> But Mr Baloyi, I just want to get clarity.  When you started testifying in your evidence-in-chief, you distinguished between a Koyoco and a Casspir and then you distinguished between a Casspir and an Nyala and I want to know if you know what the difference is between these vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The one that is parked outside is small and a Koyoco is bigger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Yes, but do you accept if I tell you that a Casspir and a Koyoco, as known in the township, is one and the same type of vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't know, I saw two Koyocos.  I only saw Nyala when it came to the Metal Box under that tree. That is where they got off and fired shots in the air.  I did not see it inside the township, I only saw it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> The question is, you differentiated between a Koyoco and a Casspir at a stage.  Your evidence at a stage was that when you looked at Metal Box, you saw two Koyocos and a Casspir joined the two Koyocos.  You changed your evidence under cross-examination.  And what I want to establish is, do you accept that a Koyoco and a Casspir is the same type of vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am very sorry,  you see I don't know this word or name "Casspir" because that's where you will trap me, you will me on the name "Casspir".  I just know a Koyoco, a big one and a small one similar to the one that's parked outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So can I ask you this, do you know what a Hippo is?  Mr Baloyi, do you know what a Hippo is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't want to tell a lie.  I only know a Koyoco, I call it a Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Do you always talk about a Koyoco, don't you use the term Hippo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We call it Koyoco, even a small child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> The question is, do you not use the term Hippo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, there are those who use the name Hippo, they know it.  I just hear them talking about Hippo.  I don't know what kind of a vehicle a Hippo is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, do I understand your evidence to be then that when you refer to a large police vehicle, you would use the term Koyoco and you would not use the term Hippo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying you are the one that is talking about a Hippo, I am talking about a Koyoco.  So you should know the Hippo better, I don't know it.  I only know a Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, I want to establish what is going on in your mind, I want to establish how you use your terminology and the question is very ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr da Silva, the witness has repeatedly told you that he knows this by the name of Koyoco and that is enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, may I address you, Mr Chairman please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> The terminology of Hippo is going to become very relevant in my further cross-examination, and it is important for me to establish whether this witness uses the term Hippo or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He has told you that he uses the name Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's move onto the next question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>	Do you know a suitcase, a vehicle known as a suitcase?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did say that I saw two of them in Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, not in the township.  They were just parked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> How do you differentiate between a suitcase and a Koyoco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They are different, military vehicles are different.  They are vans and they are covered on the side, but you can actually see the heads of the people who are inside, through the roof.  Those are the ones that are called suitcases.  I don't know what you call them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So you say the one difference is that a suitcase doesn't have a roof and that you can see the soldiers' heads sticking out of the top of the vehicle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Can you explain to the Committee whether there are any other differences that you know of between a suitcase and a Koyoco, apart from the fact ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Look, I've never been to the army, I've never been to an army camp so I cannot talk about army vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So you say that when you were standing at your house - you must correct me if I'm wrong, you're standing on your lawn or in front of your house and you're looking across the veld towards Frikkie Meyer Boulevard and you saw two suitcases.  Is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You say that at a distance of 350 metres, whilst standing in front of your house, you could distinguish two military vehicles in Frikkie Meyer Boulevard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were not moving, they were stationary.  I said so.  I don't know what they were doing there.  They were just stationary, they did not move.  The only ones that were moving were the Koyocos, the ones that were running or moving through Umzimvubu Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, a report was handed in yesterday, it's marked Exhibit EE, and it deals with the visibility of certain people at certain different places in Boipatong, in similar situations as when the attack took place.  Now I want to ask you, when you were watching the Koyocos moving from the township towards the footbridge, is it your evidence that they were in your sight the whole time, that they were in your sight for the full distance of 350 metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> These vehicles were visible.  Look you cannot know now, there's a difference because some structures have been put up in that area, but if you could stand there you could see everything.  I will take you to the front of the house, to the back of the house, you could actually see everything.  That is how I saw these vehicles at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So is your evidence that after these two vehicles left Umzimvubu Street, you could actually see them and you had them in your sight the whole distance from when they left the township till when they got near the footbridge, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> You see that was our responsibility because we had been beaten up and we were loading people who had been injured, so we were watching.  We did not go to sleep that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, I'll repeat the question, perhaps you don't understand the question.  Was your evidence - let me ask you this, when you first saw these vehicles, can you give an estimate of how far you were from these vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am not in the position  to say.  I would request you to accompany me to the place so that you can see the distance.  All I know is that I saw these vehicles.  I cannot tell a lie about a distance.  It is a place that is within view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I've paced the hall yesterday, from the front here to the back of the hall, it's 25 paces, can you give an indication, was it the length of the hall, two halls, a soccer field?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Look I don't even want to estimate, I don't want to commit myself.  That would be telling a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You explained to Mrs Pretorius that you sometimes use glasses to read, when were these glasses or spectacles prescribed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't use them except occasionally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Did you go and see an optometrist to obtain these spectacles or how did you obtain the spectacles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I went to the doctor, but then thereafter I did not have a problem with my eyes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> When did you go to the doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I cannot recall.  I was still working at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> When was this, when did you stop working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It has been five years since.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So at the time of the attack you were still working, Mr Baloyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I don't think so.  I would have to have a look.  I don't want to tell a lie, but I think I was not working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Where would you have to have a look to establish when you stopped working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I'm going to look at the date on which I left for pension.  I want to talk about something that I am sure of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You say you were working when you obtained the spectacles, can you give an estimate of how long ago you obtained these spectacles?  Was it 10 years ago, 15 years ago?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Maybe six years I can say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Look the attack took place seven years ago, and I get the impression from your evidence that at the time of the attack you were not working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I was not working.  That's what I am saying.  I don't want to commit myself to these dates.  I just want you to ask you know, the questions that are important because the other ones are not important.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> The Chairman of the Committee will decided which questions are important, Mr Baloyi, but in any event, what is your standard of education?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Standard five.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So you can read and write, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I can write.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And what work did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I'm not working anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> The question is, what work did you do when you worked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was a driver and doing first-aid and I was a mechanic at Afrox.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You were a driver.  Why did you obtain spectacles, why did you go to the doctor to obtain spectacles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not require them for driving.  You see there are these machines that have sparkles of lights and sometimes they can affect your eyes so that you cannot see, you can have a problem in seeing, like welding for example.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So are you saying that while you were working at Afrox, the welding machines affected your eyes and that you had to obtain spectacles, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was not doing welding there.  Welding affects you even if you walk past you know.  The mere look at the sparkles affects your eyes and you end up having watery eyes, so that you have that problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Since the accident - let me put it to you this way, since the attack in 1992 until now, you haven't had an accident which has affected your eyesight, or you haven't had an operation to your eyes, have you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I only went to hospital once since I was born.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Now will you please look at Exhibit M2. Do you have Exhibit M2 in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Someone better pass him a copy as they had to do last time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't want this.  Is it a map of the township?  I have my own map.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, just listen to me carefully ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Look, I am not going to look at this thing, I'm not going to look at this.  I can see it, but it's not important.  Look, I cannot make out what's happening here, but this one that belongs to me is important.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I can see.  You see there's nothing that I cannot see here, but I don't want to look at this.  You will end up saying my eyes cannot see.  Look, this is not important, I'm talking about important things here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, just listen to my question please, Mr Baloyi.  Is it not so that you don't want to look at that document because you can't read it, because your eyesight is not good enough to read it, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, that is not true.  Tell me what you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Then why don't you want to look at that document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Look, these things have not been done the correct way, the appropriate way.  The whole plan of the township is here, this is the one that I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Look at the back of the hall, look at the back of the hall please and you'll look at some gentlemen that are standing next to a table, what do you see on that table?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There's this plastic container and glasses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Yes, is there something written on that plastic container?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I can see three 3's, but then I cannot see on the other side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Is it written in - what colour is that written?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Red.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And can't you see - if you can see the three 3's, the plastic container turns in your direction, you should be able to see the rest of the number.  Can you see the rest of the number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Look, I would have to go there and have a look because I cannot see the numbers clearly, they are on the side.  I don't want to tell a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Are you saying that from where you're sitting, that from where you're sitting, you cannot see all six figures, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr da Silva, for the record, it is quite that the witness can see what's on the table and also what's written on that plastic container on top of the table, so far as those numbers happen to be visible to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> But, Mr Chairman, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I don't think we can take this matter any further.  This is not the time to do eye testing here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairman, there's one aspect that is important, with respect.  The figure on the container consists of six figures, he's identified two and the eye, his visibility is very, very important and his credibility is also very important because his evidence is that from he's sitting he can't see all six figures because the container is round.  I don't think he's correct, and I'll submit with respect, I'm entitled to test him in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well if he is not correct you will tell us what is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, I submit to you that from where you are sitting, that all six figures are in fact visible from where you're sitting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I can see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And what are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> 3 and 9.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> There are six figures, what are the six figures, Mr Baloyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> And 7.  I cannot see the other one quite well because it is on the side.  I don't want to take the chance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairman, I have two short aspects.  I note it's five past eleven, I don't know if you wish to take the adjournment now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) of those aspects.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> They should take approximately 10 minutes, at the outset.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Well if you want to continue and finish you can do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I'm going to go over to a new aspect, Mr Chairman, so if you find it appropriate to take the adjournment now we can take it now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Well I suppose you know, we have the interpreters who might want to take a break and the witness too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, let me remind you, hopefully for the last time, that you are still under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MACHIHLILE WILSON BALOYI:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr da Silva.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DA SILVA:</span> (Cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>	Thank you, Chairperson. </p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just before you go on, there are a number of documents which are being given to us from time to time during the course of the proceedings and one doesn't know what one does with these documents and where they come from and for what they are intended.  I think perhaps as a matter of procedure, if there is a document that is intended to be added in, could we be notified so that we know that there is a document and then it can be marked appropriately, because otherwise it will just get lost in this mass of documentation that we have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, if I could explain.  You will know that I was asking for a long time for a copy of the interview that was referred to in Mr Malan's affidavit ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, yes, yes, indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> ... and I asked Mr Mapoma to make copies of that for me.  I was going to hand it in and have it made an exhibit number and then unbeknown to me it was handed out before I could do that.  So I apologise for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, it's okay, it's okay, it's been done before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But perhaps it should be marked Exhibit FF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> FF, alright.  And then it goes up to 10, 10 pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's a 10 page document, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  Let me just make a record here.  Very well, the interview by Riaan Malan with Pedro Peens will then be marked Exhibit FF.  At this stage there's no mention as to what is the status of this document suffice it to say that it purports to be what it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's the interview which is referred to by Mr Malan himself in his affidavit.  He says that a transcript of the interview was given to the TRC, or to the Amnesty Committee.  This is that interview.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, okay.  Well perhaps I should make a note of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, it is referred to at page 9, paragraph 22.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Paragraph 22, page ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Of Malan's affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  Do you accept that, Mr Lowies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I do, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The other point is that Mr Baloyi has a concern which he wanted to raise with you, Chairperson.  He was trying to do that now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Baloyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying that here, as we are sitting here it happened that on Tuesday two people went to my house whilst I was still here.  They went to measure, to take measurements.  I would like to ask as to whether that is legally permissable, to leave the owner of the house behind and go into his house.  If that indeed happened, I would like for these people to come forward and apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would counsel investigate these allegations made by Mr Baloyi and then report back to me just before lunch or perhaps at the end of the day today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I can assist you in that regard, Chair, at this moment already if you would like me to.  Mr Strydom, myself, Ms Pretorius went out to the place, we stook outside in the road to see what we could observe.  End of story, nothing else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Well as I understand the allegation, it is that you went inside the premises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, that is denied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry, we were five, but the three of us here, my attorney and Mr Tshabangu, Nana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You did not enter the premises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I know that people did enter the premises.  Excuse me, I have neighbours so that when you went there they were watching.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, what you're telling me is what was reported to you, is that right, you were not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I have asked your counsel to investigate that matter and then to report to us probably either the end of, well perhaps tomorrow morning before we start, how is that?  I think that will give them enough time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, but I am told now that Adv Lowies, Pretorius and Strydom, together with their instructing attorney and Tshabangu, one of the applicants, went to Boipatong and they did not enter your house, the premises of your house, okay?  Very well.  Mr da Silva?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Before I proceed with questioning Mr Baloyi, may I place the following facts in regard to the canister which is at the end of the hall, on record, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>	I stood where Mr Baloyi is seated and I measured the distance from where he is seated till where the canister is, and that is 26 paces.  From where Mr Baloyi is seated I could observe the full number which is in the canister.  It is a white canister, the number is written in red letters.  It could possibly be interpreted as a telephone number and the number is 33-4771, 33-4771.  In fairness to the witness, the first downstroke of the 4 is indistinct.  I measured the length of the figures, they are six centimetres long.  I've also measured several motor vehicles parked in the vehicle park outside and the normal registration number of a motor vehicle is seven centimetres long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's very helpful because I can't see those figures myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairperson, I can ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Just for completeness, there also small glasses on that table next to the white canister, which Mr Baloyi picked out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>	Mr Baloyi, I don't have many more questions for you, so if you'd just be patient, there are a few aspects I want to clarify with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And no-one has measured the size of those glasses.  Can you see them from where you are, Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I can see them, but I'm wearing my glasses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> They look approximately 10cm high.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairperson, if they're the same glasses as in front of me, these ones are 13cm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well you have a better eyesight, Mr da Silva.  You're the one who has a better eyesight than probably most of us.  Anyway - yes, thank you, Mr da Silva, we've noted that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You will recall that you explained yesterday in your testimony that you were standing outside your house when you were looking at these people going in the direction of the footbridge and you referred to what was a forest and they you explained that it was called a forest because the grass was so high and then you indicated fairly high grass.  Could you explain how high this grass is?  If a person had to walk in the grass, do you disappear or is there any portion of a person that sticks out when you walk in the grass?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I cannot really explain that because at the moment there is no longer any grass there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr da Silva wants to find out from you is, are you able to give us at least an indication of how tall that grass was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> From Bafokeng Street towards that open space you could clearly see vehicles at Frikkie Meyer, but the grass was about that high.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you just place your hands again, where you say the grass would be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That high.  You can see their heads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You indicate with your two fingers across your chest, that that is how tall the grass is.  Could you stand up?   Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I would need Mr da Silva's ruler, it's perhaps a metre, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairman, I'd estimate about four feet, in old language, 1.2 metres(?)</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, who can translate that into metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> 1.2 metres approximately, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well Mr Berger is not far off the ...(indistinct) then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, I understood your evidence then that while you were still standing in front of your house, you turned and you could see Metal Box, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, up to this day I can still see Metal Box from my house.  I could see all the way to the robots.  I even saw it this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Yes.  Now while you were standing there, that is when you observed one Koyoco parked underneath a tree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not just stand in one position.  There was fighting going on, you would observe it momentarily and then move to another spot, but there was a Koyoco in front of that gate at Metal Box.  A smaller vehicle then later approached and then one from Amatola moved towards that spot and then a flare was fired and we could all see this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> What I'm trying to establish, Mr Baloyi, is approximately where you were standing when you saw this vehicle, were you in the vicinity of your house or did you move away from your house to observe this vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was standing inside my premises, on the yard.  Even if I'm standing at the front of the house, I can see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Right.  Then you saw this Koyoco.  Can you explain, if you can remember, was this Koyoco more-or-less in the middle of Metal Box, while you're looking towards Metal Box, or was it to the right of Metal Box or was it to the left of Metal Box?  Can you explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I will put it to you straight.  Metal Box is on the other side of the street and that open space where the vehicles were parked was just an open space with no grass, there was just a tree.  There were two Koyocos and one Nyala parked there.  The white people alighted from the vehicles and they shot a flare into the air.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Now when you're saying "on the other side of the street", you're talking of the other side of Nobel Boulevard, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, that's the street, you know it.  That's also where you travelled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Now where this vehicle was standing underneath the tree, can you indicate whether it was more-or-less in the middle, to the left or to the right of Metal Box, or can't you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The Metal Box gate will be on the left and the open space on the right and then the vehicle was parked near that open space.  And on your way to Metal Box, you would travel along Nobel Boulevard, and these vehicles were parked just alongside there on an open space.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You then said a white man got out of the Koyoco and shot a flare, could you see what he did to shoot the flare?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I would like you to listen to me very carefully, I do not want to repeat one thing over and over again.  We still have many issued to discuss here.  They alighted from the Koyocos, stood on the ground, took a gun and shot in the air.  There was a light.  I do not know what that light was.  You may be in a better position to explain what it was.  I just saw something that lit up the air.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So I understand your evidence to be that you actually saw this person take a gun and point a gun in the air, which caused this light.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He had the gun which was slung over his shoulder and he pointed it upwards and fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Now can I ask you this, your house I understand from my colleagues who visited the house, and the garage is one building, is that correct?  It's not a garage separate from the main building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Just hold on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Just wait.  I have the plan right here.  I have recently rebuilt my house.  I'm not talking about hearsay here, I'm just saying, telling you what I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, now Mr Baloyi, your house as it stands now and that plan, does that indicate your house as it is now or as it was then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> At that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I see from this plan that if one looks straight at the house, that the house and the garage is one building, that they're actually connected, would you agree with that?  They've got a common wall ...(indistinct) stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It is connected, but the garage is at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> When you say you got onto the roof of the garage, were you ever on the roof of the house when the, immediately after the attack or during the attack?  The question is; you say you got onto the roof of your garage, were you ever on the roof of the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I would have not have gotten on the roof of the house, I was on the garage rooftop and I was on my stomach watching over, but I did not spend a long time there, then I got off the roof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> But I understand you to say you were never on the house, only on the garage, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> When did you first consult with Ms Cambanis or Mr Berger or Mr Malindi, in this matter?  Did you consult last year at a stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I cannot recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You must have seen them before these hearings started, did you see them before the hearings started?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, we all know that the day these hearings started, we had to adjourn so that we could meet our clients.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm sorry, I'm just looking at the map.  What is the issue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I've asked the witness if he can indicate when was the first time he consulted with my legal friends, the legal team on the other side, my learned friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and Mr Berger you were saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Mr da Silva said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>"You must have consulted with Adv Berger and Ms Cambanis before these hearings started",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>... and my learned friend was here and he would know that we had to take an adjournment so that we could meet our clients for the first time.  And Adv Malindi wasn't here even at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Perhaps I can rephrase the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>	Did you consult with any of my learned friends before August 1998?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, we did consult them, I think it was last year, although I cannot remember the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Alright.  And you told them your version of the story?  You told them the version of what happened, you told them the version that you've told this Committee over the past three days, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They did not consult with just myself, they consulted with the other people.  I was not then able to tell the whole story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You see, Mr Baloyi, why I'm asking you these questions is that my learned friends filed a memorandum setting out what their case is.  They did so on the 8th of August 1998.  It's been handed in as Exhibit O, and in paragraph 9.8 they set out your version of what occurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you direct ...(indistinct) what paragraph? - 9 ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> 9.8 at page 17, Exhibit O.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>	I'm going to read to you what they say in that paragraph.  They start off by saying:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>"Standing ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If I can just ...  Chairperson, 9.8 doesn't purport to be Mr Baloyi's version, it's an instance of what Mr Baloyi would say, but it's definitely not his whole version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I think his attention at the moment, as I understand it, is merely directed at paragraph 9.8, where a statement is made about him and which indicates, which would suggest what he must have said.  Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.  I have no problem with that, it's just my learned said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>"... where your version is set out"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>... and it's definitely not his whole version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I think he may have, ...(indistinct) part of the version I think ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I accept that it's a very concise summary of a version, and I accept for the purposes of these proceedings it's not a full version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, indeed, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, in that paragraph the following is stated, and I'll read it to you and you can make whatever comment you like.  The following is said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>"Standing of the roof (I would accept it's on the roof) of his house, Mr Baloyi saw two armoured police vehicles parked in the veld just west of Thembu Street."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>And the point I'm trying to make is that you say you were standing on the roof of your house, your evidence now is that you're standing on the roof of your garage, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was on my stomach.  I would have not just stood upright because they could have spotted me.  And if you get on the roof you would have to walk first before you lie on your stomach.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Alright.  Then the following is said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>"The attackers passed by these vehicles on their way back to Kwamadala."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>And then the following is said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>"Shortly thereafter, the two Hippos ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>The words: "Hippos" are used, did you mention the word "Hippo" to your representatives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There is just one Hippo that returned to Bafokeng Street.  At that time we were loading persons from the Buwa family onto the ambulance.  Those are - that is the Hippo that returned to collect the body.  There were two persons in that Hippo, a white police officer and a black officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> But I'm trying ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr da Silva is asking you is, did you say "Hippo", did you use the word "Hippo" when you made the statement to your attorneys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> As I said before - I beg your pardon with regards to that, I cannot say whether I mentioned it or not, but the word that I know well is "Koyoco".</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> And then you say the following</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>"And another two Hippos from within the township followed the attackers back to Kwamadala."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>As I interpret this paragraph is that there were four Hippos moving away together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, that is not what I said.  I have testified from Tuesday ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Baloyi, you're not being asked at the moment about your evidence before us, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What you're being asked about is a statement contained in a memorandum which refers to you and mentions two Hippos and another two Hippos.  Do you understand that?  This memorandum was submitted by the attorneys who are acting for the victims, including yourself I believe.  You're not being asked about what you have told us.  What Mr da Silva wants to find out is whether what is contained here is what you said to your attorneys, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, but the one vehicle that remained was the smaller vehicle, the smaller police vehicle.  So there were four bigger vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> As it pleases.  Mr Baloyi, on reading this document and this paragraph, submitted by your legal representatives, it appears that you said to them that there were four Hippos moving together with the attackers.  Did you at any stage say this to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I think I may have, I admit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> So you explained to them that your recollection of the incident that you observed was that while these attackers were moving towards the footbridge, there were four Hippos accompanying them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The Hippos followed them.  And the Hippos that had been travelling along Umzimvubu reached the robots first and then the ones that had been parked at the gates, the Metal Box gates, joined them and they all proceeded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What he wants to find out is, did you tell your legal representative that as the attackers were proceeding towards the footbridge, were they being accompanied by four Hippos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Is that the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't know, I may have told them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I must put it stronger than that, Mr Baloyi, you must have told them because they wouldn't have got this version from anybody else other than you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But the version in paragraph 9.8 doesn't talk about people being followed to the footbridge, it talks about four Hippos following the attackers back to Kwamadala.  And Mr Baloyi has repeated again that the two vehicles moved up towards Umzimvubu towards the robots and the other vehicles moved to join them.  That's all that is recorded here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The statement is clear, I don't think there can be any debate about what it says.  The witness has answered the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> As it pleases you, Mr Chairman. I'll leave it at that, Mr Chairman, it's a matter or argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>	I'm almost finished, Mr Baloyi.  Yesterday when, or during your cross-examination you made reference to the different colours of the different vehicles that you'd observed in the township, and I just want to read you the notes and what I want to - I want to read you my notes and what I want to get from you is your reference to Vaal Commando.  I've got the following notes:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>"The Casspirs are yellow and the pick-up vans are yellow"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>I got the impression you were talking about police vehicles.  Then you said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>"The Casspirs have a blue stripe with a blue light"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a>Then you said the following:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a>"The Koyoco has a back door"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>And then you said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>"Some Koyocos colours is grey and other police Koyocos have a camouflage colour"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>Then you said the following:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>"The Vaal Commando have a yellow colour"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>Now what I want to know firstly, when you were referring to the Vaal Commando, precisely to which vehicles were you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I usually see Vaal Commando vehicles and I spotted that they were yellow, but as I mentioned yesterday, I do not want to commit myself to the colours because the vehicles are resprayed now and then.  I really mentioned it yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you've just told us that it was yellow, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, sometimes they are white, sometimes they are another colour.  They are sprayed differently each time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, you said that sometimes they're other colours, what other colours?  You've mentioned white, you've mentioned yellow, what other colour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't even want to go into that, I don't want to go into the colours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand what he's conveying is that he doesn't want to commit himself to any particular colour of these motor vehicles because as he says, the colours are changed from time to time.  So he doesn't want to say the motor vehicle was yellow, only to find that the following day it's sprayed white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Very well, Mr Chairman, I'll leave it then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>	Mr Baloyi, I just want to clarify this aspect, is it your evidence that you saw Vaal Commando vehicles, which are Casspirs and which are yellow?  That's what I want to know from you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not see them in the township.  If you refer to yellow vehicles, I did not see them in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Mr da Silva wants to find out - and if you know you will tell us and if you don't, say so, you talked about the Vaal Commando motor vehicles.   Now what he wants to find out is, the Vaal Commando motor vehicles that you saw, what colours did they have, did they have one colour or did they have many colours, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not recall very well, but after the attack I saw those vehicles and they were yellow in colour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And before the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not see them before the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> During the attack or immediately after the attack, did you ever see Vaal Commando vehicles which are yellow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, I put it to you that you're mistaken, the Vaal Commando has never used Casspirs.  Can you make any comment in that regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not want to commit myself with regards to the colour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Now I'm ...(indistinct) the make of the vehicles, I'm putting it to you that they have never used a Casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr da Silva, when did he say Vaal Commando used Casspirs?  If you can refer me to that bit in his evidence I'd be grateful, because I've read my notes of his previous evidence, the piece you've been referring him to, there's no mention there that he ever said Vaal Commando used Casspirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairman through you, Mr Lax I want to clarify this aspect, because he was speaking about Casspirs and in the next breath he spoke about</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>" Vaal Commando have a yellow colour"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>So I just want to clarify and put it to the witness that there's no misinterpretation in this regard, that the Vaal Commando never used Casspirs.  And if the witness can't help us in that regard, then I accept that, Mr Lax.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Ja, there's just a difference between putting to him that he said it and clarify whether that is in fact what he means.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> As it pleases you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>	Can you dispute, Mr Baloyi, or can I ask you this; have you ever seen the Vaal Commando using Casspirs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know about that, whether they use Casspirs or not.  I don not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Okay and then I want to put it to you, Mr Baloyi, that the Vaal Commando used their armoured vehicles.  There's a vehicle called the "Buffel" and it's brown in colour.  Can you give any comment in that regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am grateful for that information, but it is something that I would not keep on my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Baloyi, when you looked at Frikkie Meyer ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just for the record, I have a note here which says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>"Vaal Commando was yellow"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I was just drawing to your attention that I do have a note which says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>"Vaal Commando was yellow"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>... the motor vehicles.  He did say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>	Mr Baloyi, you testified that you saw two military vehicles on Frikkie Meyer Boulevard.  I want to put it to you that you are mistaken, that at different stages there was only one vehicle there, there were never two vehicles together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I know that is what you're going to say, but I saw two vehicles parked there.  I have already told you that there were two vehicles.  I think I've told you three times already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Okay.  Then the last question that I want to put to you, Mr Baloyi, you indicated that while the attackers were leaving the township, that you saw the two Koyocos and an Nyala in Nobel Boulevard.  I want to put it to you that a military vehicle moved down Nobel Boulevard and they never saw police vehicles.  Have you got any comment in that regard? - at the stage when the attackers were leaving the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I do not know about that.  I saw the vehicles that I've just mentioned.  I don't know where they headed or what was happening, but I saw them parked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I have no further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DA SILVA</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr da Silva.  Yes, Mr Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BOTHA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>	Mr Baloyi, only three aspects that I want to take up with you and I'm going to be very brief.  I'm not clear on the Koyoco that you saw in front of your house on this particular night, especially on the colour.  Did you see what the colour was or didn't you see what the colour was?  Did you see and you don't want to tell us?  Did you see or didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't want to commit myself to colours.  I really don't want to commit myself to colours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Sir, all that I'm asking you is, did you see what the colour was or didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I did not see it, only the shape and that it is a Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Sir, how did you see what the colour of the people were that were inside of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There was a movement of people inside.  I could see the movement of the people inside, but I could not make out as to whether they were white or black police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> So you can't say that the people inside the Casspir were indeed white people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No.  The ones that I saw were the ones who were sitting in front, those were whites.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Sir, but if you could see their colour, definitely you would have seen the colour of the Koyoco as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But Mr Botha, we've gone through this I don't know how many times.  His evidence is there.  I don't think the matter can be taken any further.  He could see people moving inside the Koyoco, but what he is certain about is that the people who were in front were white, he noticed them.  He didn't see what the colour was.  We know from his evidence that at a later stage a Koyoco came back to the township, it had a white and a black, that we know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> As you please, Mr Chairman, I'll leave it then for argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>	You say that people fired teargas at some of the victims, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> ...(indistinct) incident earlier in the day, when the police apparently came into the township and chased the comrades away.  He put that at round about 4 to 6 o'clock, somewhere round about there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Indeed, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> At that stage you say the police fired teargas at the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> How did they fire it?  What was the procedure, was it canisters they used or did they fire it with the rifles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just before he answers the question, may I remind you, Mr Botha, that you represent Mr Peens, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Indeed Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  And Mr Peens only, is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, only Mr Peens, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And Mr Mey represents Tshaka and Greef.  Alright.  This witness has not said anything about Mr Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Indeed Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Unless you want to do as Mr da Silva has done, lay a foundation in order to put your version or dispute some of what he has said, based on the instructions that you have from Mr Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Mr Chairman, this aspect of the teargas was a second aspect of my cross-examination.  It's not that relevant, except that regarding his credibility.  The last is identity on Peens, Greef and Tshaka and I'll move onto that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but if - you are here primarily because your client has been implicated, in particular by Mr Nosenga.  That is why you are here.  So if a witness does not implicate you, that does not give you the licence to cross-examine any witness unless you have a version that you want to put to the witness, which is inconsistent with what the witness has said.  His credibility has nothing to do with Mr Peens.  Whether we believe this witness or don't believe this witness, has nothing to do with Mr Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Mr Chairman, if that's the Commission's view of it, that Peens is not implicated, I wasn't sure about that and that's why ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My notes may not be accurate, but I do not recall this witness mentioning the name of Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, not at all, Mr Chairman, the fact is that Nosenga mentioned Peens as one of the people inside the Casspir.  And as this witness is not able to exclude the possibility, I thought it best ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To do what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I thought it best to cross-examine him on that.  But if it's ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Unless the suggestion is that the people who were at the back of the truck, I mean of the Koyoco that he saw, amongst others was Mr Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, that's not the version that he gave and that's neither the version of Mr Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then what's the point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That will be all then, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BOTHA</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS TANZER:</span> ... father Patrick phone you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was not looking at the time, it could have been around 6 in the early evening, 7 or 8, I'm not quite sure, I cannot remember.  It was in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did he tell you how he knew of the imminent attack, from where his sources came?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Father knows many people.  He is known by many people who are able to tell him if there is something, to warn him, not that he would have to do anything and then he phoned to inform me about that, so that I too could pass the information on and that I could protect my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So did he hear of the attack only on that date, or had he heard of it earlier?  Had he heard of an imminent attack taking place, earlier than the 17th?  Let me rephrase that.  Rumours of an attack taken place or being spread, earlier than the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, we had not heard anything before that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Now besides Father Patrick, were there any other rumours regarding an imminent attack on Boipatong?  Was there any other talk of an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We were always on the lookout.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> ... Kwamadala Hostel dwellers and the members of the South African Police Force, during the 1991/1992 period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So you were not aware of any kind of collusion between Inkatha members and the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I don't know whether there was this collusion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did you suspect that there was some kind of collusion, was there like a suspicion amongst the Boipatong residents that the IFP and the police had some kind of relationship?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They may have thought so, but I for one, concluded or should I say came to realise that there was this collusion between the two on the day of the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did policemen frequent the Boipatong location during the early '90's, 1991/'92 period?  Did they used to come often into the location or did they keep away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They used to come.  They used to come, they were not barred, but they were not in good books of the people of the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Were any policemen known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you mean apart from his son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Apart from his son, obviously.  Were any policemen, during 1992 or in the 1991 period, known to you, as the Chair said, apart from your son or family relatives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I know them, I used to see them, but I had no association with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did you ever hear of a policeman named Peens or called by the name Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did you ever hear of a policeman named Tshaka, called Tshaka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I was hearing that for the first time here at the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> ...(no audible question)</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> On the night of the attack, did you notice the attackers putting the stolen loot into the police vehicles that you described?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were carrying these things.  I did not see them load these, the loot in into the police vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> What was the relationship like between Dodudu and Mtwana Zulu in 1992, at the time of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Apart from the fact that Dodudu was part of a traditional dance club?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Yes.  It was a good relationship?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Very much so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> And what was the relationship between yourself and Mtwana Zulu like, during the 1992 period? -in fact about June 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We were not seeing eye-to-eye anymore because things had turned difficult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> No, I don't think the way I understand it, it's a correct interpretation.  The witness said ...(Sotho), not to say that they didn't see eye-to-eye. ...(no further audible statement) ... put that again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying during that very same year the contact between the two of us had since broken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Had Mtwana Zulu been in your house before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Before?  What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well had he been in your house, in your home, in your living-room, as a guest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, not in the dining-room.  I am saying we are in good terms and his children usually come to my place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did you not take Father Patrick's warning seriously because of the relationship between Mtwana Zulu and yourselves having family in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just repeat the question please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Well, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I saw it as important.  I took it seriously, but there was nothing I could do because we had not yet been attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was part of this crowd that you had seen earlier on, still going past your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, they were still passing by.</p>

<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're talking about a corpse being dressed in black.</p>

<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, Ms Tanzer said "cop", not corpse, but perhaps it got lost in the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I'll rephrase the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, perhaps let's just stick to the word "police officer".</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Yes.  Did the police officer or officers who came to fetch the corpse, in the Koyoco after the attack, were they wearing black tracksuits?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, only the white police officer was wearing a black tracksuit, but the black officer was wearing a police uniform.  And they had come to fetch only one corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Now you put the two together when you mentioned in your evidence that you also noticed the police office, or white men on the street, running on the side in black tracksuits.  Was that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I said I associated them with this one who was wearing a black tracksuit and I noticed that the other ones were white as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Did you notice police vehicles driving slowly through the Boipatong location, moving alongside the attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> In the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> In the location, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I saw the one that came to park in front of my vehicle, not in the township.  Look, my house is at the end of the township, so I could not have seen the vehicles in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Do you know of a structure in Boipatong that was used as a mixed hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am the one who constructed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Is that structure near your home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It is far away, it is actually nearer to Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Would you say that the attackers followed a certain route on that night of the 17th of June, or were they randomly attacking different streets in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Look, I don't know about the different routes, I am at the beginning of the township.  I only saw them on their way out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... the mixed hostel that you referred to, did it have a name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It was just called Boipatong Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> And my last question is, the attackers that took the route, as you gave evidence, via the robot, not past the nursery but via the robot, back to the hostel, the Kwamadala Hostel that is, were they being accompanied by the police vehicles or were they behind the police vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yesterday I said the vehicles were stationary and these people were moving.  They were not accompanied by the police, the police vehicle only followed from behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> The police vehicles that made their way from Umzimvubu Street up towards the garage, those are the vehicles I'm talking about, were they ahead of the attackers that took that route or were they accompanying the attackers on the route?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, these people had already walked past that spot and the other ones had taken the footpath direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that when you saw the motor vehicles, the police motor vehicles in Umzimvubu Road, the attackers had gone past?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.  See, these vehicles were moving slowly and the people were walking past the vehicles as they were moving slowly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> So the attackers were ahead of the vehicles, not behing the vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am saying, as these people were moving past these vehicles, the vehicles were also moving, but slowly.  They were in a hurry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Alright.  I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS TANZER</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>	Mr Baloyi, were you ever asked by anybody to testify during the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the second question, what was your position in the church in 1992, June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> We have no positions in that church, the Roman Catholic Church.  It is only the Priest who delegates what people should do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why was it that you were delegated to perform certain tasks in the absence of Father Patrick?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't know, God must have planned so, that I be chosed, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Mr Berger wants to find out is that there must many people who belong to the Roman Catholic Church in Boipatong, now what he wants to find out is why did Father Patrick single you out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I am going to answer you as follows;  it is my faith.</p>

<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> By way of giving first-aid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, I did not render first-aid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm sorry, Chairperson.  Just for the record, Mr Baloyi said that Manyeka there were two and it was interpreted as "two houses", and I think his evidence was "two people".</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Shall I record that?  This is where, at Manyeka?  Manyeka, right.  Thank you, Mr Berger.  Yes, Mr Lax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, just one small aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>      Mr Baloyi, you told us that you were not politically affiliated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you also said at one point there was no trouble between you in the township.  That's how you put it.  You said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a>"no trouble between us"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a>Did I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I don't know what trouble you are referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well you were being questioned about conflict in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I said there may have been problems amongst the youth, but it did not affect the entire township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And then you were asked about why the IFP people had left the township, or were afraid to come into the township and you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a>"They were afraid to come in because they had tried to kill people."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, I did say so, but the problems or rather the conflict was between certain individuals, not the entire township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You were then asked to explain that and your answer was</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>"Yes, we were attacked and killed as ANC members"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a>Those were the words that were translated and that you used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.  As we were attacked by these people they would kill that, the residents are Boipatong are all ANC people, but that was not the actual reflection of the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you were cross-examined, I think it was by Mr Lowies, you indicated that at some stage - this is the stage I would like you to clarify for me, when you heard the noise you went to the gate and then you saw nothing and you returned to your house and continued watching television.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now when you went to the gate, was the Koyoco, or had the Koyoco that you saw already arrived or was it before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No, it was before it arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It hadn't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It had not arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  And then you said that after the Koyoco had left - I'm now talking about the Koyoco that you saw on your garden, are you with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said after that Koyoco had left you then saw a crowd, a group of people, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I think you estimated them at about 400.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> It must have been over 500.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Were these people passing next to your house, on the street next to your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There were some walking in the middle of the street and some were walking along the sides.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  And it was part of this crowd that went to Mr Buwa's house and the other one went to Mr ...(indistinct) house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The people who were walking along the sides were the ones who went into the Buwa and ...(indistinct) households.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is what I want to find out.  When you saw Mr Zulu, had this group of people gone past your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They were just walking along because they were a throng of people, some carrying goods.  The people had already gone into Buwa's house and it was at that time that I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whilst there were people at Buwa's place, was part of the crowd or the group of people that you had seen still going past your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, there were many of them, they were still passing.  These other people just went into these houses and did what they wanted to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then you mentioned, I think you said about three people came to your house, amongst the three there was a person who had an axe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now as these people were coming onto your house, was part of this crowd that you had seen earlier on still going past your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes, they were still passing by.</p>

<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now in regard to the items that were either stolen or damaged at your house, you mentioned that - was the gate to your house damaged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the front door was also damaged, was it?</p>

<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then the television set was stolen?</p>

Initially I thought maybe it's a bridge over Frikkie Meyer, but when you look at the map it's just between Frikkie Meyers and the township.  What goes underneath the bridge?</p>

<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STRYDOM:</span> Actually one statement and one question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>	Mr Baloyi, you did not testify at the Goldstone Commission, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> I never went to court, they refused me entry.  I was supposed to be the first person, but I was refused entry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, the question I want to ask you is; did you give your version of what happened to the ANC or their legal representatives at the time that the Goldstone Commission was in progress, or just before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There have been many statements that have been taken from me.  I did give information to the Goldstone Commission as well as in Delmas.  I have given statements there.</p>

<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> There was talk about it, but I cannot say who it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But as far as you can recall you have never testified before a judge or an inquiry such as this one, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No.  We were taken there many times but never had the opportunity to speak.</p>

<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We never said that he would be the witness, we said Mrs Buwa would be one of the witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Then I misunderstood, but that is the statement of a person we thought is going to be a witness.</p>

<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And when the police in the Hippo told you to go to sleep, do you remember any particular words being used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> They spoke in Afrikaans and in Zulu and said: "Hamba lala".</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> You say you were patrolling near the corner of Baralong and Thaba Baseu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, Baralong and Thaba Baseu, at the corner of Baralong and Thaba Baseu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> How many were you on this patrol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> We were about 10 or 15.  There were many of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And why were you conducting this patrol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> We were on the alert to avoid the Inkatha attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> The group which included yourself, in what capacity were you conducting this patrol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> We were patrolling barehanded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> As this group that was patrolling, did you represent any structure in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> There was no structure in Boipatong that I represented, except the Sporting Coats.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> After you were told to disperse by the police who were on this vehicle, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I decided to go and sleep because I had a feeling that we would be safe as the police informed us to go and sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did the police do anything else besides telling you to disperse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, they dispersed us through teargas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did you go to sleep after you took that decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did you sleep in this address that you have given to the Committee, 684 Mosheshwe Street, in that particular house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Is there anything else that happened during the time you were in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, I think it was at about five to ten, I got into bed.  I was with my girlfriend who was already asleep by then.  I always leave my radio switched on the whole night.  At about 10 - we had the news on Sesotho Stereo, at about ten past ten or twenty past ten I heard a sound of gunshots and sound made by windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> What kind of sound was made by windows?</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Breaking windows, that was the sound made by breaking windows hit by stones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> After you heard gunshot sounds and the breaking of windows, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I asked myself two questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> What were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I asked myself, whereas we were told to go and sleep, was it members of our team who are breaking windows?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And was your, the question to yourself answered in due course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> The question did receive a response, because I found out that these were not people of our group, they were a group of Zulus who came in swearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> When you say "they came in swearing", what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I heard them say: "Get out dogs of Mandela".  In Zulu that would be ...(Zulu).</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And when you heard those words you were still in your room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Could you tell where these people who were uttering these words were in relation to your room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I think they were at the second house from where I stay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> After you heard these words, - before I proceed, you said earlier that you asked yourself two questions, what was the second question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I asked myself whether these were members of our group or was this an Inkatha group that has started to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was then the second question whether this was an Inkatha attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, that was my second question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And you have said that you got the answer to your questions.  What happened after you heard these words being uttered: "Get out dogs of Mandela", or words to that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I woke up dressed in my trousers not a T-shirt.  It was fortunate that they did not enter the house neighbouring mine otherwise I would have left for the streets.  They got into 684, the yard where I stayed.  They broke windows, windows to the whole house, by then I stayed in a shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Was it a shack at the back of house 684?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Whilst they were breaking windows, I told myself that they have not yet arrived at the shack.  They broke the kitchen window and then kicked the shack door.  God does work in miraculous ways.  After they had kicked the shack door - I heard an iron behind the shack door, I was leaning against a cabinet and the door was not kicked open that much, only slightly opened.  It was dark inside the shack.  I could see people outside because there was moonlight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a>	Three men arrived at the door after the door was opened.  One of them said: "They are asleep".  I was not asleep by then.  They used a sharp object to stab my girlfriend, called Nxula.  The eighth time when he tried to stab her, I took or grabbed this sharpened instrument from his hand, so much that I tried to stab him with this instrument for him to feel how it was.  They ran away.  As they did so one of them tripped and fell at the house door.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you just slow down a bit?  You grabbed this instrument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> The first one that stabbed my girlfriend, as I pulled it from his had I could not stab him, he ran away.  As they did so ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> As they ran away one of them tripped and fell down and the left the second sharpened object.  There was one that was left on the ground which they used to break windows.  Meaning I had two of these sharpened objects and the one that they used to break the windows with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Okay.  After you picked up these sharpened instruments, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Goldstone requested the exhibits or evidence to that effect, when we went to Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And what did you do about this request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I took them to the courts of law as they were requested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Mr Rahantlhane, just one aspect I want to clarify.  You were testifying about something that prevented the door to your shack from opening fully, what caused it not to open fully?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I had an iron behind the door.  When they kicked the door - as I said, God works in miraculous ways, the ironing board prevented the door to open fully.  My bed is just next to the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> When this man was stabbing your girlfriend with this ...(Sotho) or sharpened instrument, was he inside the shack or was he outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> They were standing outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And how seriously injured was your girlfriend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> She was seriously injured.  She spent about the whole year, her wounds bleeding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> In conclusion, Mr Rahantlhane, now you've picked up the sharpened instruments, did you do anything to assess the injuries that may have been sustained by people, or damage to the property?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malindi, are you referring to the main house or the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> To both their shack and the main house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the main house, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I would start first with the house.  They broke all the windows to the house, broke the door.  Although it didn't open, they did break the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And did you do anything about your injured girlfriend that same night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I knocked at the main house.  Although they were scared I knocked at the window and I took her into the main house through the window.  At about 11 o'clock when everything was quiet outside, I went to the shack and got my first-aid kit and tried to stop the bleeding until the ambulance arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And was she - what happened after the ambulances arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I went along with her to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> After your girlfriend was stabbed did you remain with her or did you do anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I still stay with her at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> I mean on the same night, immediately after she was stabbed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I didn't go anywhere else, I took her to the house and waited for the ambulance.  As it arrived we went along to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Mr Rahantlhane, on Mosheshwe Street, what is the nearest corner to 684 Mosheshwe Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> It is Thaba Baseu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> So in other words, house 684 Mosheshwe Street is on the south of Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MALINDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, what is your girlfriend's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Christina Matlhodi Moremi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Christina?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Can you spell that for me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> M-A-T-L-H-O-D-I, Matlhodi.  Moremi</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a>M-O-R-E-M-I.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In terms of Section 20.2 of the Act, this Committee, regardless or whether or not it grants amnesty, it is obliged to refer a person who in its opinion is a victim of a gross violation of human rights.  That is the position regardless of whether you grant or refuse amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a>	Is there a schedule that has been prepared, which indicates in somewhat detail what each of the victims, in particular those who will testify, sustained both in terms of the injury or the damage?  Is there such a document? - so that we don't have to go through ...  I've seen it in the memo. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MS BERGER:</span> Chairperson, there's a proforma form which we handed out some time last years for all the victims to fill out, which sets our those particulars, which we then forwarded to the Committee on Reparations.  What we will do is, if we furnish you with copies of those proforma forms, then all the details will be there.  We can do it that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will be there.  Okay, very well.  Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a>	You've concluded your examination-in-chief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> I have concluded my examination-in-chief, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any cross-examination, Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> None, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I beg your pardon, points to clarify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Nothing, thank you, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.  Mr Strydom starts, and if there's anything left we may call Mr Lowies and the remaining ones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a>	Do you know if your girlfriend, Ms Moremi, laid a charge after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I do not know if she did lay a charge.  I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know if she testified at any other, or at any forum at any stage in connection with this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> It may happen.  Maybe it is concerning her injuries, but as to what happened, I am the one who knows that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Do you know if she did testify concerning her injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I cannot say I know the evidence she gave.  You will find she does not attend a lot of meetings.  After the 17th we left for Sebokeng for about a week or two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> No, but the question is, do you know if she gave any evidence, whether in a court of law or in a Commission, did she give any evidence, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That may be the case, that she got injured in the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Rahantlhane, the question is, do you know if she did give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> She was present at the Johannesburg City Hall's TRC hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> The other one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> It was in Pretoria, where I accompanied her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What happened in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> We took this sharpened instruments to hand them in as evidence at the Goldstone Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom, do you have any further questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a>	Apart from the occasion that you went to Pretoria to the Goldstone Commission, did you ever go to Pretoria, to the court in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I have never been there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Do you know if your girlfriend went to Delmas at any stage to give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> She has not been to Delmas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You testified that your girlfriend was injured and then she spent approximately a year in hospital, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Please understand me.  She was injured so much that her wounds were still bleeding although she was discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You see I want to put to you that it seems to me, if I look at my records, that she was not a complainant at the criminal, when the criminal case was heard.  So what I'm putting to you is that she never laid a charge, can you comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> She did lay a charge.  I was present when she testified at the Truth Commission's hearing at the City Hall and she did say, she was asked what she would say if the Truth Commission asked her what must be done for her as a compensation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But what I'm putting to you is, she never laid a criminal charge against the people that attacked her.  Can you give us any information or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Strydom, perhaps you should explain what you mean by "criminal charge".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, I will do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It's clear this person is not that clear on the issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What I want to put to you is that she didn't got to the police to complain about the fact that she was attacked and seriously injured and her case was not put against the people that were charged subsequently in the Supreme Court of South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Mr Strydom, if the police were effective during those days we would not have been attacked and now I wonder to whom would we report the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't this a matter that can be objectively ascertained by having a look at the indictment?  Does anyone have a copy of the indictment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I've got a copy.  I've checked, there's no such a charge.  All I want to know is if she gave evidence at any of these criminal hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well from the look of things she didn't.  Let's move onto another question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.  When did you tell your legal representatives that are representing you at this stage, that she was injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> ...(no English interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, we have not heard the interpretation of the witness' answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The witness did not understand the question quite well in Sotho when I put it to him, so I was just repeating the question to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I think long ago last year when we met with them, and other meetings where I met with them, even here at Iscor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Because I want to put to you that your legal representatives gave us a memo, a memorandum setting out what happened at the various houses in Boipatong on that specific night of the 17th of June 1992, and according to the document that was given to us, with reference to a 684 Mosheshwe Street, it's only stated</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a>"smashed windows'</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a>... nothing is said about the injury to your girlfriend. Can you give any comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I said I have full evidence, even the blankets with the holes in them.  I said there were three blankets with holes and three sharpened instruments, so-called ...(Sotho).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you give a written statement to the people there at the Goldstone Commission?  Apart from handing in the weapon, did you give a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And in that statement did you mention that you were part of a group of people that patrolled the township that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom, so as to know where we're going, I understand that you may be laying a foundation, is it going to be the applicants' case, at least those that you represent, that the girlfriend to Mr Rahantlhane was not stabbed as he has testified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson, that's not the case, what I'm trying to establish is if she made statements, so that we can get hold of them.  If she was stabbed one expects that she made statements and we want to find out where those statements are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, indeed I understand all the inquiry, but what's the purpose of that inquiry?  I mean, is it going to be the case that the events that he is testifying to did not happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, that's not the case.  What I'm trying to establish is if she laid charges and if she made statements, so that we trace those documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I understand it.  Because if it is not the applicants' case that she was not injured, that the events that he has described did not occur, then where are we going?  Let me see whether I can assist you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a>	Mr Rahantlhane, we understand from your evidence that you took the two sharpened instruments to Pretoria, I think you said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is correct, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Now do you know, or did you hear of the Goldstone Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I know of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Do you know whether your girlfriend gave evidence before that Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I know of the one in Johannesburg where I accompanied her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would that be the TRC hearings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Now do you know whether your girlfriend made any statement, either to the Goldstone Commission or the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I only know about the Goldstone Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  What about the police, do you know whether she made any statement to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I do not think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, yes.  Does that make you happy, Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I'll take it from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a>	You say that you were patrolling the street, why did you patrol the street, against what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> We have already heard through the grapevine that Boipatong might be attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But wasn't it a normal situation during that period to patrol the streets on a daily basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> No-one would go on patrol without nothing happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Isn't it so that during that period a group known as the Self Defence Units were patrolling the streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I was on the patrol, but I was not part of the unit, only as a resident in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So do you say that such a unit existed, but you were not part of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I told you that I do not know of such,  I was involved in sporting structures.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So don't you know - have you ever heard of the Self Defence Units or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you build barricades in the streets and dig holes into the roads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What was the purpose of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> As Mr Nosenga stated that they used to shoot people, driving by and shooting people and we realised that it will be difficult for them to do so if we dig holes and barricade the streets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was that to prevent the police from coming into the township, or other attackers, or other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> It was to prevent the attackers, not the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What time did you start your guard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Late in the afternoon at sunset.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You mentioned earlier that you already, that you heard through the grapevine that the township would be attacked, who told you what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> When I say "through the grapevine", the source is unknown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But you must have heard it somewhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> His source is the grapevine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand it a grapevine is an undisclosed source, or it's a rumour that you pick up somehow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I'll ask the question the following way ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Unless of course grapevine in these hearings has a particular meaning that I'm not aware of.  I know that there's been talk of a microwave and the green beans ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why did you get the feeling that Boipatong would be attacked that night, or didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I am still asking myself the same question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now you started the patrol at sunset, how long thereafter did people arrive there who said, I think you said: "Hamba lala"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> It was at about a quarter to ten or ten to ten because at five to ten I was already in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What I want to know is, how can you estimate the time with such precision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why do you say it was that time, on what basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> You requested me to estimate the time, according to me it was something to ten because at 10 o'clock I heard the news on the radio.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So at that stage you did not - when the warning was given you did not look on your watch or anything of the kind, you just worked it back because you heard the news at 10 o'clock, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is what I say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Was this a common thing, that police vehicles will drive around and if they find these people on guard, that they will tell them to go to bed and stop the guard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That night when we were on patrol that is when I heard of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What kind of vehicle ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Now you already said:"Koyoco".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> It was a Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What was the colour of the Koyoco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> It was night time, I did not recognise the colour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> How many occupants did this vehicle have, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I did not see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What did you see about this Koyoco, did it come to a standstill, did people get out, what did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> They did not alight out of the vehicle, they shot the teargas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What was your position at the time that you saw the Koyoco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You mean position in what, in society?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, in the township, his location, where was he standing or sitting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Please explain status in society or you mean position in society or where was I standing.  Please explain very clearly for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.  Where were you in Boipatong when you saw the Koyoco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> We were in Baralong Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Were you close to any intersection or close to any house you can mention a number?  I just want to get the position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> At Thaba Baseu and Baralong intersection it was the second house which I entered in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That's now the position where you were, what was the position of the Koyoco when those words were said from the Koyoco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> It was in Majola Street moving along Majola Street and coming into Thaba Baseu Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You say that the vehicle turned into Thaba Baseu and started driving in the direction of Baralong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> We were running away.  As it came we ran away and hid ourselves in the yards nearby, but it entered into Baralong Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> What I'm asking you is, did the vehicle turn into Thaba Baseu from Majola Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> It was not from Majola.  You said how far was it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, all I want to know is in which street was this vehicle when those people shouted: "Hamba lala"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I said in Majola Street.  We were in Baralong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.  So the houses were inbetween yourselves and this vehicle, because you're in one block down, one block further away towards the southern direction, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Will you please explain, I do not understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.  You said the vehicle was in Majola Street, you were in Baralong Street, so you were one street block down or towards the south from this vehicle, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom, the applicant's may have a case different from the impression I'm getting from the evidence.  As I understand the evidence and the background to this attack, and this is what was put, which was the evidence of Mr Baloyi;  from time to time the police patrolled Boipatong, and this is what the residents apparently did not like and which is why they erected the barricades in and around the township.  Is that common cause or is that an issue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I would say that's common cause.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is common cause, yes indeed.  Now is it an issue that on the day of the attack those patrols continued?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The applicants can't really comment on that because they were not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The police will be able to say that.  But I will accept that patrols continued during, if it was a normal patrol it probably carried on during that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well it was a normal - well if the patrol was there the previous day, unless there was no reason to patrol on the - so you're saying it is common cause that the police would patrol the township, that's not an issue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That's not an issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Right now ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, but as I see it, the reason why this witness is called is to make, to say that very shortly after these people were chased away, the attack started.  So the reason why this witness obviously was called is to make that nexus and that's the basis why I want to track this witness on, specifically time, as to establish when in relation to the attack, this incident took place.  And I would submit that is relevant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No-one is suggesting it isn't.  I just wanted to make sure that I understand what the issues are.  I understand that you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a>	Let's just take it from where I stopped.  The police - let me just establish that, you referred to a Hippo, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, I will leave that to my learned friend.  When the people from the Koyoco shouted: "Hamba lala" you were a block away from the, is that correct, a street block?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I want to explain to Strydom that this car was driving along Majola, it came along Thaba Baseu from Bapedi Street.  You have a street that goes down Thaba Baseu, it joins Bapedi and Thaba Baseu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And when you saw this vehicle you started running away, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Those were our lives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> But why did you run away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> They would shoot at us with teargas if they would find us in the streets.  We were running away for our lives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> How did you know that they would shoot teargas, did they normally do that, that's the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> They did shoot at us with teargas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, on that occasion you say they fired teargas, but had they done that before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I'm referring to incidents of the 17th day of June 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That's exactly the question, Sir.  How did you know that they will fire teargas, why did you start running away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> They sprayed teargas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Wasn't this just a normal police patrol of the kind that's been happening for a long time in Boipatong at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Do you mean teargas, spraying or shooting of teargas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I do not know on that score.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you run away from police vehicles before, whilst patrolling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I never ran away from a police car before I started patrolling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> You said that the people in your group didn't have any weapons, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Did you always patrol without weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is so, and I would ask myself what would we do if attackers would come and us having no weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Why did you bother to patrol if you were unarmed?  What can you do if you're not armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I did not know that the attackers would come armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're telling us that you always ask your question, I mean what would we do if we are attacked because we are not armed?  Is that the question you ask yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you find?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> It was a question that remained like that.  Knowing that as a resident I would have to go out and patrol like other men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you ever raise this, did you ever ask this question from your fellow patrollers, as to: "Hey, what if we are attacked here?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> We used to ask ourselves this question, but we didn't know that the attack would be scaled in the manner it did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Because the applicants said, when they entered Boipatong on that specific night they came up Lekwa Street, or when they got close to the intersection of Mosheshwe and Lekwa Street, the comrades as they describe them, fired shots to them.  Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Mr Strydom, would you repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The applicants have already testified and they said that when they got to the corner of Lekwa and Mosheshwe Streets, shots were fired towards them from the direction of the shops down Lekwa Street.  Do you have any knowledge of that?  Did you hear shots or something like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I did hear shots even if they were shot by people from outside, but I heard the gunshots from Lekwa Street, when they came along Mosheshwe.  I was inside the house by then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> So do you maintain that no-one of the guards who used to guard Boipatong had weapons with them, is that what you're saying or not? - or only you didn't have weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> In my group no-on had a weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> When the police told you to disperse, why didn't you regroup, why did you just go to bed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I said, when they said we should go and sleep I went to my place to sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STRYDOM</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't have a mike do you?  Do you need a mike?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LOWIES:</span> Unfortunately I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a>	Mr Rahantlhane, I want to put certain aspects which are actually common knowledge to you and I would like your comments on that.  I want to put it to you first, which may not be common knowledge, that I sometimes listen to the Sotho radio and the first thing that I'd like to put to you is, is it not so that before the news starts there are six beeps, toot, toot, toot, before it starts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Do you mean the sound you have just made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, there's a beep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Even if you can listen to Sesotho Stereo there is no sound like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> The reason why I'm putting this to you is, in 1992 the radio station, Sesotho Stereo did not exist.  There was a Sotho radio but it was not Sesotho Stereo, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And at that stage it was not an independent station like it is now, it was run by the SABC, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I don't want to talk about Lesotho Stereo, I just listen to the news.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And I want to put it to you further that at 10 o'clock at night there was no Sotho news on the Sotho radio in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Well I don't know, I hear that for the first time from you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now but you're the one who told us that there was news on that day, and I say I dispute it, not in 1992, the news was at 8 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> There was news at 10 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And I want to suggest the following to you; if it is true that you heard the news on that night, it must have been the 8 o'clock news.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I insist that I listened to 10 o'clock news, not 8 o'clock news.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> How did you know that it was the 10 o'clock news?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Before the news broadcast they mention the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And is that the reason why you say it was 10 o'clock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, I think that's the reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> How do you know that on that day they mentioned the time, was it because they always do it or because you can specifically remember that specific day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Every time before the news broadcast they state the time.  If it is 6 o'clock news they will state that and they will also state who is going to read the news.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Mr Lowies is asking you is, that is now on the 17th, did you actually hear the news-reader saying what the time was or are you just assuming that each time the news is read they will start by indicating what the time was?  Did you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, I do understand.  I have already explained that when I arrived at home it was around a quarter to, or ten to ten and at five to ten I was already in my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But Sir, do I understand you correctly, the reason why you're so sure about the time is because you listened to the radio, is that your version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) you say you arrived at home approximately a quarter to nine in the evening?  I beg your pardon, a quarter to ten.  This is after you had been told by the police to go and sleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Yes, thank you, Mr Lowies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you.  Mr Rahantlhane, did you look at your watch or are you relying on the radio, in order to make sure what the time was when you, the time that you are talking about in your evidence here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I want to tell you this, if I knew what is going to happen that day I would have gone out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, but my question is not that.  My question is, do you relate the time to the radio or did you have a watch with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I heard the time from the radio.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You did not have a watch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But when you arrived at five to ten there was no announcement as to what the time was, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> When I arrived at home it was around a quarter to ten to ten to ten.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And that is an estimate, not something that you heard on the radio?  Let's just get this clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, I did not hear that from the radio, just an estimation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you actually fall asleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I went to bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you fall asleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Was your girlfriend already asleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now Sir, were you a member of the comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I think anybody can be a comrade, you can also be a comrade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Were you in 1992 a comrade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I don't understand you, can you please explain what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you know what a comrade is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Well I don't know, that is why I'm asking you to explain to me what is a comrade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So if you don't know, then can we take it that in '92 you were not a comrade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I was just a sports person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you want to tell us that where you're sitting here today, you do not know what the comrades were, who they were, what they did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> 3 o'clock till 6 o'clock I'm at the sports ground for practice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you follow my question?  Do you, here today, not know what a comrade is?  Did you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I was never involved in politics and that is different from what I was involved in, that is sports.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr Lowies is asking you is, as you are sitting there now, do you know what a comrade is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Have you ever heard of the word: "comrades"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, I did, normally we call each other comrades, in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now when you were doing patrols, would the people refer to you as the comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, we used that name to call each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And did the people also refer to you, other people, as the comrades when you were doing your patrol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I can also call you comrade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You can, but that's not the question.  The question is, did the people refer to you then as comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> They called me Johannes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And the group of people doing the patrols, were they referred to as the comrades?  Do you want to answer this question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> They called me Johannes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Ntati, the question is, were you referred to as the comrades? - and the you I'm referring to are the people who used to do the patrols, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> The people who were patrolling with me called Johannes.  This name comrade is a name that we use everywhere, even in Parliament they use that name comrade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lowies, I heard you say Ntati, please feel free to cross-examine the witness in Sotho ...(indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Chair, ...(Sesotho)  Yes, I can speak Sesotho, but I prefer my language and this is a manner of addressing a person of whose language you can speak, Mr Sibanyoni will know it's either Rah(?) or Ntati, which is a sign of respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Can I just ask a question.  Apart from calling you Johannes, did the people who were patrolling with you also call you comrade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry, I did not get the answer because my headset wasn't on.  May it be repeated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He said "no".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> The answer was "yes"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The answer was "no".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry, Chairman, I apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a>	I want to put it to you that you are trying to hide something, Sir.  You well knew what the comrades were in 1992, everybody knew and you were actually a member of the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is what you are saying.  Because in 1992, I was a leader in my netball team, I was also the Deputy-Chairman of the Boipatong Football Association.  I was also involved in the PTSA in our local school.  I was a Deputy-Secretary of Boipatong Resident's Association.  I was involved in Boipatong Football Association as a President.  I was also the owner of the team known as Arizona in Boipatong.  I didn't have time for other meetings, political meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Is that your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, that's my answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I also listened to your evidence in Sesotho and initially when you gave evidence you didn't use the word "Koyoco", you used the word "Hippo", not so? - in-chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I started mentioning Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you know the difference between a Koyoco and the Hippo, or is it one and the same thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I don't know the difference, I only know Koyoco.  I don't know whether they are the same thing.  The only thing that I know is a Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you understand Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now what was the attitude of the people patrolling the township with you at that stage in 1992, did they trust the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> We trusted the police because when they said to us we should go and sleep, we went away and we went to sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So you're saying that because they said so, you thought that it was now safe to go and sleep?  Is that what you're trying to convey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now why did you then run away from the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I did not run.  From the first house at the corner there is a passage there, I went through that passage, I was near that passage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So you did not run away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I did not run.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You did not go and hide yourself either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> We only went to hide ourselves when the Hippo came, but that night I did not go and hide, I just went to my place to sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Just a correction, he said when the police came, he didn't use the word "Hippo", Mr Interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I said Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now Sir, the point is this, that night when the police came, did you go and hide yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> They came to us once, they did not come for the second time on that night of the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> The question is, when you saw the police, did you hide yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> They were screaming from Thaba Baseu, then I went through the passage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you.  I still haven't got an answer.  Did you go and hide yourself? - when you saw the police on the night of the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I said that night of the 17th, the police only came once.  When they told us to go and sleep we went away to go and sleep, there is no-one who went to hide anywhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you run away that night of the 17th when you saw the police? - run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I did not run away, I was just walking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did any of your colleagues run away?  When I say colleagues I mean the people patrolling with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Well we do not stay at the same place, maybe they tried to hide or to run away, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> The reason why I'm asking is, in your evidence-in-chief you told us that you did two things, you ran away and you also hid yourself on the night of the 17th, now you deny it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I said we were running away and hiding ourselves when we saw a Hippo.  That was our life.  I was not specifically mentioning on that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> My attention is drawn to the fact, I didn't listen myself, that you referred to the word "Hippo".  You made use of the word "Hippo", is it true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I talked about a Koyoco, you started mentioning a Hippo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You used the word now, Sir, you out of your own mouth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> You started mentioning a Hippo.  When I started talking here I talked about a Koyoco.  I don't know a Hippo, I only know a Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So why do you use the word "Hippo", you out of your own mouth, without reference to Hippo in cross-examination at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I don't remember saying a Hippo, I said  a Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Excuse me, Mr Lowies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a>	Do you often use Koyoco and Hippo interchangeably, in other words, do you make any difference between a Hippo and a Koyoco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is why I didn't want to mention a Hippo and a Koyoco.  I only know a Koyoco because I don't know the difference between the two.  The only thing that I know it a Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But do you also know that there is a vehicle called a Hippo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And you know it differs from a Koyoco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Well I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, Mr Lowies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry, is it your evidence that you think that a Hippo and a Koyoco is the same or not, in your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I am talking about a Koyoco, not a Hippo.  I don't know a Hippo, I only know a Koyoco.  If you say to me they are one and the same thing, then I'll accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now Sir, I want to suggest the following to you;  your version that you were accosted by police, that you bumped into the police on the night of the incident is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> If you say so maybe you were present, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, I'm putting it to you that when you say that, you're telling a lie here with a purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I cannot comment apart from what I've already said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words, do you still stand by what you have said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> ...(no English interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Can you remember what clothes you wore that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> How can you remember the time that was announced on the radio before you went to sleep, is there a specific reason why you can remember that time, that on your version was announced before you went to sleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, Mr Lowies, he didn't say he went to sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Went to bed.  I'd like to rephrase.  	When you went to bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> You mean when I went to bed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Is there a specific reason why you can recall the time that was, on your version, announced on the radio?  Why would you remember the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I remember because immediately after the news from the radio the attack took place, that is how I remember the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, you see what Mr Lowies wants to find out is the following;  you've told us that you specifically remember that the news-reader announced the time as being 10 o'clock, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr Lowies wants to find out is why do you specifically remember, not that the time was 10 o'clock, but that the news-reader announced the time and said it was 10 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Chairperson, everything that took place in Boipatong will be difficult to forget it if it happened to you, but you can only forget it if it happened to somebody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We understand that, but all that he wants to know is, do you have any specific reason why you particularly remember that the time was announced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I remembered that after, I recorded that in my mind.  I remembered the time because after the time was announced the attack took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you know what time the attack stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> From our street I think it took about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You see, there's another reason why I'm crossing swords with you pertaining to the time.  There was a memorandum prepared pertaining to the allegations of the Boipatong residents and paragraph 2.1 reads as follows</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a>"Between approximately 19H00 (that means 7 o'clock in the evening) and 21H00 (that means 9 o'clock in the evening), the SAP moved around the township dispersing youths who were on patrol as part of the Self Defence Units."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a>Now it appears to me that read in context, if anything happened it must have happened between 7 and 9, not 10 as you say.  When I say "anything happened" I'm referring to the dispersing by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I don't know the person who wrote that statement.  What I'm saying is what I saw because I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And it also appears to me that the people who were patrolling, it's common cause that they were Self Defence Units,  you say you've never heard of them.  From what I've read it appears that it's common cause that they're Self Defence Units, you say you've never heard of them, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> No, I've never been an SDU member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Have you heard of the SDUs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I have said this before, I have never heard about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> What caused the police on the night of the 17th, to use teargas?  Can you just describe the scenario there at the time when this happened, what was happening?  Can you give us detail regarding that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I cannot answer that question because they just said to us: "Go and sleep".  They forced us to go and sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Didn't you want to go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> We were patrolling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Didn't you want to go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That is our township, therefore we wanted to patrol in our township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But I still don't understand.  It's actually a simple question.  Why did the police use teargas, describe the reason why, what happened, how did it happen that they used teargas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you know why they used the teargas, tell us, if you don't know, you don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I have explained that I don't know why they used teargas and there's no-one who can tell you to go and sleep because we sleep at midnight sometimes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it a fact that when you were told to go and sleep, that I think round about nine twenty or thereabouts - at the time when you were told to disperse, that would not be the normal time that you would disperse, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You'd normally disperse at about midnight, from what you've just told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Sometimes we'd disperse around 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, yes.  So when the police told you to disperse, did you resist that order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That night when they said we should go and sleep we went away and we went to sleep.  I also went to sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And is the only reason that you did so because of the order by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, that's the reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> The only reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That's correct, that is the only reason, because if it was not their instruction to us, we would have dispersed in the early hours of the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I see.  Now were you requested by the police on previous occasions to disperse, where you were part of a group patrolling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> It only happened on the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now did you ever arrest or catch people whilst on patrol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you ever have to intervene in a fight when you were on patrol, to protect a person or persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> No, I have never come across that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you have no contact with the civics in these positions that you held and that you described to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, we used to work with them as they were the community leaders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Was that an ANC structure, the civics and the community leaders in Boipatong in '92?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> All members of Sanco come from different political organisation like ANC, IFP and others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And that was the situation in '92?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And is it not so, Sir, that you had meetings with Sanco? - you personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I have never had a meeting with Sanco.  There were leaders from Sanco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you attend meetings with those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> There are different meetings, there is a general meeting.  Can you please explain which meeting are you referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you ever attend meetings with Sanco or people from Sanco, you personally?  That's the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> You don't go to a meeting if you are not invited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you want to answer the question?  Did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I have never attended Sanco meetings, I only attended the general meetings.  So you cannot attend for example, the NG meeting if you belong to the apostolic church.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now the meetings that you attended - now we know that you've attended meetings, between which parties was it, who were the people at the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, Mr Lowies, you've asked him a lot of questions about the meetings, the organisation, I mean where is this going to take us to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I would suggest this person tries to create the impression that he was not involved in politics at that time, which is not true and this will explore that. It's in the process of exploring it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We've got to get to a point at some point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'm almost finished, Chairman, but this is an important point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You see the impression that you wanted to create earlier is that you never attended meetings, but we now heard that you did attend meetings.  I want to put the following to you as the result, Sir.  You are trying to make as if you had no political affiliations to anybody and that is not correct because of three things.  It's common cause that the comrades and the SDUs patrolled the streets in Boipatong on the night of the attack, you pretend not to know anything about it.  Your comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Where do the comrades belong, to which organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Second point ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Rahantlhane, counsel has the right to ask you questions and you have to answer those questions.  If there are any questions that you want to ask you can tell your legal representatives to ask those questions on your behalf, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He has put to you two propositions.  The first one is that you are denying deliberately your political affiliation, so what do you say to that, do you agree with him or don't you agree with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I disagree with him that I was involved in politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  What was the second proposition, Mr Lowies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'll phrase it as follows.  It's common cause that the SDUs were busy that night with patrols on the 17th, yet you pretend not to even know about them, whilst you were a member of a group patrolling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> When I answered you, Mr Lowies, I said as a parent or the father in a household, when it is said that you should go and patrol, you have to go, you cannot expect other men to do that for you.  That is why I went out.  I also went there because I was a member of the Boipatong community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr Lowies is putting to you, and listen very carefully, he says it is common knowledge that the Self Defence Units patrolled the township.  What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> Even if it was like that, what I'm saying is that at that time I was patrolling, I was not belonging to a political party, I went out there to patrol because I was a member of the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> On your version you only saw one vehicle that night, police vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Because in paragraph 2.6 of the memorandum which I've referred you to, mention is made of armed vehicles at the specific street, Baralong.  It reads as follows"</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a>"Armed vehicles dispersed other groups of youths at the corner of Baralong and Thaba Baseu Street, at all the intersections along Amatola Street and Umzimvubu Street."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a>Do you know anything about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well that's a matter of interpretation you know.  These armed vehicles, there may have been one at the corner of Baralong and Thaba Baseu, another one at the intersection of Amatola Street and Umzimvubu Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I retract the question, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, so I think it would be unfair to put it to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I hear what you say, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a>	Now did you only patrol in Baralong Street that night, the night of the 17th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You did not hear other vehicles, you only saw this one vehicle?  When I say other vehicles, vehicles like a Koyoco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I only saw one vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Chair, could you just bear with me for a second?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you see the occupants of the Koyoco on the night in question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I did not see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Are you sure that Afrikaans was spoken on that night, by the people inside the Koyoco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I said they said in Zulu: "Go and sleep".  I never mentioned Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> That night you did not hear Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Because initially you said the people also spoke Zulu and Afrikaans.  It appears to me you are trying to put white people on the scene that night and that is why there's now a discrepancy, because you forgot the lies that you told earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is being put to you, Mr Rahantlhane, is that what was conveyed to us by the interpreter is that you said they spoke in Afrikaans and in Zulu.  Did they speak in Afrikaans and in Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> They spoke in Zulu, but you could hear that the person who was speaking was an Afrikaans-speaking person, when he said: "Go and sleep", in isiZulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So they did not speak in Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> No, they did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But if they spoke Zulu, how could you hear that they were Afrikaans and not Sotho, or any other language for that matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> If you are a Zulu it's easy to hear that.  Even if a white person, when he speaks Zulu you can heard that he's a white person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So it sounded like it's a white person speaking Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now these 10 to 15 chaps that were with you that night patrolling, did you ever go to Thaba Baseu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you mean these 15 chaps or him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> It was you and them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) they were patrolling in and around that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry.  You and them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> No, we never went to Thaba Baseu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Just to get it clear; not you, not them, as far as you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I'm speaking on my behalf because I never went to Thaba Baseu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you know Mr Baloyi, the previous witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> The first time that I knew is here at these hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> He said the purpose of the barricades was to keep the police and other attackers out of Boipatong, do you deny this?  I'm specifically talking about the purpose to keep the police out of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> I said the main reason for the barricades was to prevent the hit and run cars that would come into Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you want the police in Boipatong?  Did you have a problem with them going into Boipatong, because Mr Baloyi says they did not want, the people did not want police inside Boipatong.  What is your version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> That time I never had problems with the police, I loved them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, next question please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'm almost finished, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I mean if you're looking for the notes, let somebody else go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sir, there is good news, I'm really within my last one or two questions.  So I'm almost there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a>	Now did your girlfriend sleep that night when you got into bed, was she already asleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAHANTLHANE:</span> ...(no English interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LOWIES</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Pretorius, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Only one or two, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chair, before my learned friend proceeds ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then do you have any?  Would you have any, Ms Tanzer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> One or two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Mr Mapoma?  I'm trying to assess whether we should try and finish this witness now or whether we should, so that he doesn't have to come here tomorrow if not necessary.  Because if we're going to be long with him, we might as well adjourn at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Chair, I can't give a promise that it will only be 10 minutes, because I can't limit myself to that.  It may be a bit longer than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, very well.  Did you want to say something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairman, I'm sorry to raise this, but I was requested by my clients to raise it.  Exactly this time yesterday, when I stopped cross-examining - and this is leading to trouble between the different parties, there's laughter at what is perceived to be, either myself or my clients representing them, as just happened now.  This with respect - and this is a problem and I'm highlighting it, to me it's not a problem, but to my clients it's a problem, the perception is created again that when doing so they are intimidated and they perceive it as an insult to them and their legal representatives and I think it's appropriate that I raise it now while this incident is fresh in your memory, because that was actually, as I understood it, that sparked off something yesterday, which we have discussed this morning.  I must apologise that I had to mention it, but it's unfortunately one of those things I was requested to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is it that you're mentioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Sorry, I missed your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, I didn't get what your ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The reason was that my clients specifically stated that it's this laughter that happens that they perceive as something which is against them and their legal representatives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  My colleagues have observed since these proceedings started, that there has always been laughter in the audience, either coming from the applicants' side or coming from the victims' side.  We have not interfered with that, we have allowed that because it has not disturbed these proceedings in any manner.  I will therefore ask both sides, because insofar as we are concerned, our observation has been that both sides on different occasions have laughed, either to themselves or to the other side.  If this laughter is creating a problem, perhaps the rules must be changed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a>	I have mentioned at the beginning of this hearing today that there shouldn't be any abuse at either side and I continue to do so, to urge both parties to do so.  Even though we're dealing with quite a serious matter here, on some occasions things have happened at these hearings which has caused one or other person to laugh at.  We have not regarded that as being unbecoming because it is only natural that if something happens which causes one to laugh, it is so, but if that is intended to be an abuse, I think it must stop.  In the form of what must stop is the abuse, that's all that must stop.  Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a>	It seems to me that we are not going to be able to finish this witness now.  We will adjourn and resume with his evidence tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a>	Mr Rahantlhane, we are unable to finish your evidence today.  You are required to attend these proceedings tomorrow morning.  Yes, very well.   Okay, we will rise.</p>
