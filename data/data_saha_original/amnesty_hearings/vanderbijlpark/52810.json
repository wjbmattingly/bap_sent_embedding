As a Policeman I was asked to go to Sharpville and I was working in Sharpville, I was told to cool down the fighting in Sharpville.\n\tAs I was approaching Sharpville along Vuga Street, I met a big or large group of people.  They said here comes in Sotho, the little boy who is cheeky.\n\tSince I was in a van, they pulled me out of the car.  The other one said let's shoot him, the others said no and I managed to escape.  It was on a Sunday if I remember well.\n\tThe following Monday, it was discovered in the morning that the person involved was a teacher Leqwa Shando.  The children marched to the Sharpville police station because of this incident.  I was charged with criminal cases of attempted murder in this incident.\n\tThe attacks continued, directed against the Police and they were attacked by the youth who were aligned to the ANC and I wasn't staying in the township during that time, because most Policemen have to run out due to the fact that their houses were being burnt down, some of them died.\n\tOne day I visited my friend in a shibeen together with some of my other friends.  A group of youth came, this youth were known to me, they were staying around Boipatong.  They asked me to come out of the yard, it was at night.  I said to them if you want me, you know where I stay,   you can come to my home so that we can talk.  Because I could see that they were prepared to fight me.\n\tAs I was sitting in the house, they came into the house.  I was stabbed with a knife and also with a spade fork and they hit me with bricks.   I was rescued by one of the Police who was present, who shot in the air and they ran away.  I went to hospital and I was discharged.\n\tWhen coming from hospital, I went to the parents of the youth since I knew them, we grew up together.  Even our parents knew each other.  It was the Zwane family, at Letsia in Boipatong.\n\tI went to the mother and explained that her child have injured me and I asked them that we should sit down and talk as parents so that we can solve the problem.\n\tThe mother chased me away, saying that she doesn't want to get involved with youth issues which occurred in shibeens.  I went to Vanderbijl police station to open a case.  After three days, I went to the police station in Vanderbiljpark to tell the Investigating Officer that I did see the person who injured me and I demanded reasons why he wasn't arrested.\n\tNo answer was given.  During the time Police were busy with investigations of investigating people who were well known, children and comrades.",

I was with my friends in town.  We were in the same athletic club with me, I asked him, saying to him brother, since you have injured me, I just want to find out the reason why.  He said to me I am an informer.\n\tI got angry, we started beating the young man extensively and he died.  That contributed towards the anger against me, there were so many attempts to kill me.  I remember one incident when we had a ceremony where we slaughtered a lamb at home, it was in winter and the electricity was not working in the township.\n\tI was asleep in my bed at around eight o'clock.  I heard sounds or cracking of firearms or automatic rifles, directed towards my house.  There were in the house  my mother, my relatives who just visited the house and children.  This happened and it passed.  Even if I can't be specific with reference to dates and times, but these are the things that happened in Sharpville specifically, in Voka, we were sitting there, we were called, I was together with Bongani Mbatha and we were called and said, they said in Sotho, here are the Zulu's.\n\tThey took out, they surrounded us and they were armed, heavily armed.  They said Bongani Mbatha should go, they were looking for me only.  They surrounded me.  Fortunately our of pure luck, I hit someone with my fist since I wasn't armed, fall on the ground and I got a passage to escape and I ran.\n\tThey shot at me as I was running away.  When I was turning, they also threw a hand grenade.  I was injured on my leg and I was admitted in hospital.  This is one of the incidents that took place.  So many times I was attacked, and also my family was attacked.",

It goes to the question of whether this was political or whether this was criminal.\n\tThe second point Chairperson, is that these are issues which are very close to the heart of many, many members of the community.  In my consultations with the community, dealing with Nana Tshabangu, these are issues which have repeatedly come up.  I understand that one of the purposes of these amnesty hearings, is reconciliation.\n\tIf I can't canvass these issues with this applicant, the members of the community are going to feel that the issues which are important to them, are being bottled up.
