We saw a police van and we enlisted some help from them, in a sense that we wanted a lift with the police in their van and they refused us a lift and they said we should follow them instead, walk behind the van until they had escorted us outside the location but it did not happen like that.\n\tAs people were grouping and gathering the police also left us alone.  They threw stones at us, and that was the beginning of the attack.  Fortunately Mr Mbatha got hold of a stick on the ground.  As the person who had something one like a jacket I advised him to put that stick right inside his jacket, to hide it so to speak and pretend as if he is drawing out a gun from his jacket.\n\tWe tried to walk upwards towards the taxi rank and the people were following us, throwing stones at us, back and forth that is.  When I realised that we were seriously being attacked and that in no time they would get hold of us and we will be captured, I pretended as if I'm drawing something from my jacket, like a gun and they made way or they gave way to us.  We were able now to run away, to escape from them.\n\tThey never gave up, they still ran after us.  I consistently pretend as if I'm drawing a gun out of my jacket.  Unfortunately as we were about to gain exit, Mr Mbatha was hit and he fell on the ground instantly.  We took off, we left him because we could not help him in any way.  He was stabbed by stakes or the garden equipment.  He was injured.\n\tOne thing that pains me is that he was hit just before we were saved because we were just about to escape completely from the group.  He was assaulted severely and they tried to pour paraffine on his body and the police emerged immediately and they helped him or they took him with.
