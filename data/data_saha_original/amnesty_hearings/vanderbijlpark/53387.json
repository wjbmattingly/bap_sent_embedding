            "Chairperson, before my learned starts, might I hand in to you three bundles.  They are the documents which were filled out and submitted to the Reparations Committee.  They have been divided into\n- Deceased persons;\n- Injured persons and;\n- Damage to property.  \nI'm not handing it in as an exhibit, but I'm handing it in for your assistance.  That should have the relevant details for each of the victims.  \n\tChairperson, the other point that I just wished to raise before my learned friend continues with his cross-examination, relates to what was put yesterday by my learned friend, Mr Lowies, in relation to the criminal trial and the calling in of certain witnesses, including Miriam Molete and Florence Molete and in relation to their apparent refusal to speak to Mr Strydom and the other counsel, on instructions from the ANC.\n\tI've read the relevant section of the record and in particular it's pages 3208 through to 3215, 3-2-1-5.  And with respect to my learned friend, I don't believe that he put the position fairly to the witness.  At page 3210, Mr Botha is asked, Adv Botha is asked by the court whether he spoke with all the people concerned and he's asked; is it - I'm translating from the Afrikaans: \n\"Is it everyone's attitude that they have instructions from the ANC, not to speak to anyone besides the ANC?\"\nAnd Adv Botha says: \n\"M'Lord, I was not able to speak to any of the witnesses other than two, Abudnega Mabusa and Simon Moloi, who informed me that they were conveying the attitude of the other persons.\"\nThere's then a debate and the judge says:\n\"Tell them that I am busy with a trial arising from the attack on Boipatong on the 17th of June.  I've been informed by one of the advocates who acts for the accused, that they have summoned you here to give possible evidence after they've consulted with you.  And I've been further informed that you tell the advocates that you are not prepared to consult with them because you've been instructed by representatives of the ANC, that you should not speak to anyone about the case other than the ANC, is that so?\"\nAnd then there's - no-one speaks, the record simply reflects:\n\"All the witness indicate that it is so.\"\n... but no-one speaks.  Then the judge says:\n\"All of them are satisfied, is that so?\"\nAnd then again no-one speaks and it's:\n\"All the witnesses answer in the affirmative.\"\nAnd immediately after that the judge says:\n\"As a result of the \"mededeling\" (as a result of this intimation) I've been informed that they say that they are now afraid to speak to the advocates because they have been told to do so, or prohibited to do so by the ANC, is that so?\"\nAnd then the interpreter says:\n\"No, M'Lord\"\nAnd then the court says:\n\"Why will you not speak with the advocates?\"\nAnd the interpreter says:\n\"They are not our advocates, M'Lord.  Mr Abudnega Mabusa wants to speak, M'Lord.\"\nAnd then the court says:\n\"Yes\"\nAnd then Mr Mabusa says:\n\"We don't know these advocates.  This is the first time that we come into contact with them.  It would have been better if the previous advocates, if it was the previous advocates who had called us.  At this stage it is not a question of fear, we don't have trust.\"\nAnd then the court says:\n\"Who is the advocate that you consulted with previously?\"\nMr Mabusa says:\n\"There they sit.\"\nAnd the interpreter says:\n\"He is pointing to the State advocates.\"\nThen the court says:\n\"Who at the ANC offices said that, or said to them that they should not speak to anyone about the case other than the ANC.\"\nAnd then Mr Mabusa says:\n\"Concerning the ANC, they are not at issue here, we are talking about the advocates currently before the court.\"\nI'm not going to go through everything in detail, but then two described as \"women witness\", \"vroue getuie\" not identified, are asked:\n\"Is this the position, that you have been instructed by the ANC not to talk to anyone?\"\nAnd they say:\n\"No, it is not so, M'Lord.\"\nBoth of them say.  And then the second one says:\n\"We are amazed that we have been called by strange people, not those who usually call us.\"\nAnd then ultimately the court asks, this is at 3213 in the middle:\n\"Are there any of them who say that they were told by the ANC not to speak to anyone other than the ANC?\"\nAnd the interpreter says:\n\"Skud die kop ontkennend\" (They shake their heads in the negative, M'Lord)\nThe whole debate is from the witnesses saying; we trust the State advocates, we don't know who these people are and we don't want to speak to them for that reason.",

So in a sense the treatment of Ms Molete will play a role in whether other women are going to come forward and talk about their sexual assaults.  \t\n\tAll we're asking Chairperson, we understand that, and we've explained to Ms Molete that she can't refuse to answer questions, but all we're asking is that she be treated with compassion, as the Act requires, and that in our submission she has been cross-examined at length already and has answered all the questions put to her.",

The limit to that cross-examination will be repetition, but on matters that are not in issue, that is collateral issues, the answer to those questions given by the witness, is final.  It is not possible to lay down any hard and fast rules but broadly-speaking these are the limits that will be allowed during these proceedings, bearing in mind that one is dealing with an inquiry.\n\tThe other matter which is of grave concern to us and we find it deeply disturbing is that at the very beginning of these hearings it was agreed that there will be an exchange of documents that will be used during the proceedings so as to afford the other side a proper opportunity to examine the documents and prepare the case of those that counsel is representing.  That role has not been observed, and I once again urge the parties to comply with that rule.  \n\tWe have urged the parties to reach some agreement as to what precisely are the matters that are in dispute, that has not been done.  As a result of that we hear evidence on matters that appear to be common cause or that are not in dispute and in the process the process is being delayed.  And I want to state and urge the parties once again, we now know what is in issue and what is not in issue, I urge the parties to stop fighting about matters that are not in dispute or matters which can readily be ascertained, but only to agree on what evidence we need to hear relating to these matters that I have now placed on record and which the parties have agreed are in dispute.  I sincerely hope that the legal representatives will comply with this request.\n\tTo the victims who are here to testify, it is necessary that we know what happened and one way that it can be done is to ask questions as to what happened.  The purpose is not to traumatise the witnesses, but it is a sincere attempt to know what happened, so that at the conclusion of these hearings when we sit down to consider the evidence, we have the full picture of what happened. \n\tI hope I am expressing the sentiments of each and every Member of this Committee, when I say we understand the pain and the trauma that you suffered at the time.  If we had an option we would have preferred not to ask you to relate these events once again, but we have a job to do. When counsel oversteps the limit we will intervene.  I therefore ask you for you co-operation so that we can bring these proceedings to some finality.\n\tYes, Mr Strydom?",
