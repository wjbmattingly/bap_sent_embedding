<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Nosenga, may I remind you that you're still under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">ANDRIES MATANZIMA NOSENGA:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Lowies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LOWIES:</span> (Cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	Mr Nosenga, why did you say in your first application - Chair, to refer you to page 2, Exhibit R, paragraph 92, that the date of the commission of the offence for which you're applying for amnesty occurred in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, that's not what happened, the incident occurred in 1992, not in '93.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But it appears to me that you are quite sure that the application that you have lodged for amnesty regarding the Boipatong massacre happened on a specific date and you know that date as being the 17th of June 1993, how could you have made a mistake like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But Mr Lowies, I think what he is saying is that as far as he's concerned, the incident occurred in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Nosenga, the application for amnesty which bears your signature, which occurs at page R1 through to R6, and I think the signature is at page 6, you say that you signed that application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, what Mr Lowies wants to find out is, in that application which you signed, the dates of the incidents in Sebokeng is given as 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I think the interpreter did not hear me properly, the incident occurred on the 15th of June 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'll tell you why this is relevant, Sir, it's because my attorney is busy preparing a bundle, but I'm going to put to you so long what is in the bundle, and that is in the police docket pertaining to the drive-by shootings in Sebokeng, it appears that you voluntarily handed yourself over to the police in that matter.  What are your comments regarding this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know anything about that.  I ...(indistinct) explain yesterday how my arrest came about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But it goes further.  You confessed to various offences of drive-by shootings and paragraph 6 of the statement, A23, reads as follows: - Chair, sorry, may I just get a ruling here?  The statement is in Afrikaans, can I proceed in Afrikaans and it will be interpreted?  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whose statement is that, just ...(indistinct) tell us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> The statement is a statement of one, Jan Theodorus Ferreira.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Excuse me, Chairperson, if the statement is read in Afrikaans, I don't think we'd be in a position to interpret it in IsiZulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'll translate if it's okay with the Committee.  As you please, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have an actual copy of that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> They are in the process of being photocopied, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> At this stage.  But there is an extra copy with one of my colleagues here.  Could you just bear with me for a minute please, Chair.  There is an extra copy available, Chair.  I'm sorry, but this becomes relevant at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm going to give this statement to the legal representative of the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> As you please, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then in due course we will have those further copies made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> We're in the process, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You will translate it as we go along?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> As you please, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Mr Ferreira will state that he is a Constable, or he was a Constable in the South African Police in 1992 and in 1993, I think, he took or he deposed to this statement.  In the statement, paragraph 6 he states as follows</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>"I had an interview with a black man who was a suspect.  This suspect, Andries Nosenga, informed me that he would like to hand himself over.  The suspect further highlighted certain occurrences wherein he alleges that he was involved.  These apparently happened in June 1992."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>Then he goes on to state he listened to your statements or your explanations and he knows the Everton vicinity quite well, and he was able to connect the events that you described to him with a specific police docket, which is the one in this matter.  Now what are your comments so far, do you recall anything about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not remember that.  I was assaulted, that is why I confessed to that offence.  I don't know what else can I say now because I explained it all yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> In paragraph 13 he makes the following statement, well he states the following:  The suspect, being you, described various scenes to him and he was not able to trace those scenes.  This is the way he put it.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>"Certain places were pointed out but it could not be linked with specific cases."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>The contents of the docket is further to the effect that you confessed to various crimes and it was not possible for the police to link you with all those crimes that you confessed to.  What do you say about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know what they are talking about.  What I want to say is that they assaulted me with regards to the offence in Sebokeng.  I don't know what they are talking about there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand your evidence, it is correct that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know what they are talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well Mr Nosenga, listen to the question.  It is correct that you confessed to some shooting after you had been tortured, isn't that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But didn't you confess, even if you were tortured, to other offences except the drive-by shooting for Everton, Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Objection.  He's being asked to give evidence about matters which are not before this court, ...(indistinct) asked to incriminate himself, which is against the Act in fact, the Criminal Procedure Act, or any other, his Constitutional Act I don't think ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> It's against the Constitutional Act.  He's asked to incriminate himself in regard to other events and I think that question should be disallowed, with respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Chairman, I would submit the question is admissible.  There is a specific section which I can't lay my fingers on, but I'm sure there is a section in the act that says that he can be compelled to answer any questions put to him in an inquiry such as this and therefore there's a rider in this ...(indistinct).  I would submit it makes it relevant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nosenga told us yesterday that he was tortured and then he confessed to some of the things, what happens if he denies that he confessed to any other than what he admitted to having confessed to yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because it was a result of the torture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I will rephrase the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>	Mr Nosenga, I would like to put the following to you, you were never sure when you were involved in any acts pertaining to the violation of human rights.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What do you mean by that: "you were never sure"?  What are you referring to, about the incident, about the dates, about the places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> About the dates, inter alia.  But let's start with the dates.  Can I make it more concise.  Firstly, you were never sure of any dates when you committed offences, and this is clear from the statement by Ferreira and it's borne out by your reply here in paragraph 9 on page 2.  That's the point I'm trying to make, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I would like you to explain to me to which incidents you are referring to, whether the Sebokeng incidents or any other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What he - he is putting a very broad question to you and he is saying that it is clear that you do not know the exact dates when you committed the offence, the various offences, including the Sebokeng shooting, and he relies on that from what appears in the application for amnesty which described the date of the Sebokeng incident as 1993 and what appears in the statement of the police officer that he's been reading, do you agree with that or don't you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I said before, the incident happened in 1992.  I do not know whether he wants me to admit to 1993 or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He is not suggesting that this thing occurred in 1993, he's merely putting to you that you're not too sure of the date.  That's all that he's putting to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It happened in 1992, I'm sure of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now the next aspect which I'm putting to you pertaining to the above is the following and that is, you were not even sure where the offences were committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is not true.  These people tortured me and ordered me to go point out the spots and I did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I think you will agree with one thing though, when you had this, or when Ferreira had this interview with you, you did not tell him about the Boipatong massacre, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I stated before that I do not know this Ferreira.  I do not know how come you ask me that question because I did say I was never questioned on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And therefore you never tendered anything regarding Boipatong, out of your own free will either, or even under torture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The people who handled my case did not refer to Boipatong, they only questioned me on Sebokeng.  I do not understand how the Boipatong issue comes into play, because as I've already stated, I applied for amnesty with regards to the Boipatong incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And my instructions are further, Mr Nosenga, that you are trying to implicate people in this hearing which had nothing to do with the Boipatong massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am not trying to implicate anyone.  I was involved in the Boipatong incident.  I don't know what you're trying to say.  You mentioned this even yesterday and I do not understand what you are getting at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you know Sipho Lukhozi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I know a certain Sipho.  I know a tall Sipho, I don't know whether he is the same Lukhozi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> This Sipho is also a tall guy and he was a friend of Victor Kheswa.  Are we talking about the same Sipho now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The one I'm referring to was there in Sun City and he's tall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I think it's the same one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Just to put the record straight, he has been transferred to Zonderwater, but he used to be there.  Now that we know that you know this chap, were you, on your version, in a gang of which he was a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Please explain that question, I do not quite understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Well did you two belong to the same gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I know him to be a member of the IFP and I was also one.  I knew him as a member of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I understand that.  Were you in the same gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> We were in one organisation, the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> He never took part in any drive-by shooting with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did explain yesterday that I was questioned on who was present when we launched that drive-by attack.  Where did you come about Sipho's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sir, just answer the question please, the question is simple.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did state yesterday who was with me when I went on that attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You will answer the questions put to you.  If the question is unfair we will stop counsel from doing that.  You're simply being asked, did Sipho Lukhozi take part?  If he did, say yes and if he didn't, say no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, he did not take part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now the reason why this is relevant, I have instructions that although Sipho took part in drive-by shootings and was a friend of Kheswa, he was not an inhabitant of the KwaMadala Hostel.  Your comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Are you referring to Sipho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is possible that he did not reside at the hostel, but I used to see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> When did you see him for the first time, before or after the Boipatong massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot say whether I did see him or not during the Boipatong massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Well I have instructions that - and I have to qualify what I've put to you earlier, that for a short period of time he stayed in KwaMadala, but when most of the acts, drive-by shootings were committed by Kheswa, on versions put to other people, he, Sipho, was not an inhabitant of the KwaMadala Hostel.  And I would like to put the following to you, and so were you not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know where you get that from.  As I stated before, I arrived at the hostel in 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Who allocated your room to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I stated before that the person I remember giving me a room was Prince Zulu, Gatchene(?), Damarra Chonco and Darkie Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And not Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I did not mention Mthembu.  I said the person who issued me with a room was Prince Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Are you sure that Mthembu had no role in this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, I am saying that Mthembu did not issue me with a room, it was Prince Zulu, Damarra Chonco, Darkie Chonco and Gatchene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Because so far the evidence is, and this is also my instructions, the person responsible for allocating rooms was definitely Mthembu and not Vanana Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know anything about that.  What I am saying is that Prince Zulu issued me with a room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> According to you, who was the leader of the IFP Youth Brigade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> In the Vaal, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I stated that it was Themba Khosa who was the Chairperson of the IFP Youth Brigade in the Vaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And who was the leader of the IFP Youth Brigade at KwaMadala, the most senior person in the Youth Brigade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It was Buthelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> When did you meet Buthelezi for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Although I do not remember the date I think it was in 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And that stage, what was his position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I know that he was an IFP Youth member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Was he a leader, according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was the leader of the IFP Youth Brigade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you hear his evidence, were you here when he gave evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Wasn't that the first time that you saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I was not seeing him for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> What's his fist name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I know him as a Buthelezi.  Some people I know by their first names, some by their surnames.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So you know him from '91, but you only know him as Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I knew as that Buthelezi, because some of them they know even my surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Lastly on this aspect regarding your surname, how are you known?  Are you known as Andries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> They know me by the name of Matanzima.  My surname is Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And when you put your names on a document, signature on a document, which names do you put on a document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I use my surname Nosenga when I sign.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes, only Nosenga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I use Andries Nosenga Matanzima. - Andries being my English name and Matanzima is my African name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So do you use it in that order, Andries Nosenga Matanzima?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it happens that I sometimes write Andries Nosenga Matanzima or sometimes I just write Andries Nosenga or sometimes just the surname, Nosenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But never Matanzima, or do you do that as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is possible that I do write that because that is my name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But why would you only write your name and not your surname, when you have to sign a document?  That is what we're talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lowies, where is this going to take us to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Well he denies his signature on certain documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If the man says: "This is how I sign my signature", I mean isn't that answer final?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now the reason why I started off with the 1993 issue, paragraph 9, page 2, is (3) where you apply for amnesty, you mention the places Sebokeng and Everton, nothing is said in this application regarding Boipatong, why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know.  They questioned me on Sebokeng and I told them.  I do not know what happened, there must have been a problem with the person who wrote that statement because I did put in an application for amnesty in regard to Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So what we have is, Sebokeng is not the same place as Boipatong and you know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> These are two separate distant townships.  Sebokeng and Everton, Sharpeville and Boipatong are all different townships.  They are different.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So now that being the case and you knew this quite well, I put it to you that you did not when you were requested, or when you requested assistance to complete your application, mentioned Boipatong at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know about that.   I was questioned yesterday, I even mentioned Mr Brian and I explained that I did mention the issue of Boipatong and sought amnesty for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now if you turn to the next sub-paragraph of paragraph 9, you state the following</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>"The first incident was in a shack which was next to a road.  ANC supporters were known to frequent that place.  We shot at people outside a shack in Everton."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>Page 2 up until page 3, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I think you didn't get me well, these things started at Sebokeng.  We started attacking from Zone 12, Sebokeng and we did not start from Everton.  Everton actually is the last township if you have travelled from Sebokeng.  So I would like you to please explain to me what are you trying to say when you say we started at Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> The problem is, Sir, this is what you said.  I want to know what you meant by this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know about that.  I started attacking from Sebokeng, Zone 12 and proceeded to Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You see the relevant portion reads as follows</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>"The second incident was in Sebokeng, Zone 12, where we shot at people who were waiting for buses and taxis."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where are you reading from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Page 3, paragraph 9(4), Chairman, at the top, the third line from the top.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>	Is this correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct, we started at Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, but this, what's stated here is that "the second" and I repeat</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>"... second incident was in Sebokeng, Zone 12, where we shot at people who were waiting for buses, taxis."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, it's the first incident where we shot people who were waiting for taxis and buses.  It is the area just off Small Farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now do you admit to shooting at people in Everton under the following circumstances, and I quote from your statement - Page 2, Chairman, the last sentence.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>"The first incident was in a shack which was next to a road.  ANC supporters were known to frequent that place.  We shot at people outside the shack in Everton."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>Did this incident occur?  It doesn't matter when, the question is only, did something like this occur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it happened at a shebeen.  People used to frequent that place, Djomo's place at Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And was this on the same day as the shooting incident in Sebokeng or not, Sebokeng, Zone 12?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Then there's a statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>"Details of other incidents attached herewith"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>... annexed to this, forming part of this statement.  What were you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I'm not educated, I don't know what you're talking about.  May somebody please read that to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> In the statement that you made to whoever completed this form, we'll get to it now, wherein you mentioned the Sebokeng and Everton shootings, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>"Details of other incidents are attached herewith"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>What did you mean - sorry, what I'm asking is, did you talk about other incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I spoke about the Sebokeng as well as the Small Farm incident and Everton, these are the only places.  That is where a taxi was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now is Small Farm in the - sorry, I do not know the area, is Small Farm in the vicinity of Everton or Sebokeng or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is in Everton.  It is actually a squatter camp called Small Farm.  It is something similar to Central.  It is a shack area of Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> It's not Zone 12?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> When you leave Sebokeng from Zone 12, there is a tarred road that you have to take to lead you to, to get to Small Farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, in your mind, is Zone 12 the same as this Small Farm place or is it not, in your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, Zone 12 is a zone and Everton is something different.  It is a shack area that I'm talking about in Everton and the other area is the township with four-roomed houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you speak about any other place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, those are the only places that I spoke about, Sebokeng, Small Farm and Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> On this point I'm going to return to what you've said to Ferreira.  Is it not so that the places where you took Ferreira to were not only Sebokeng, Zone 12 and the shack in Everton, but you took Ferreira to various other places as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't recall, maybe that happened because I was being tortured, but I pointed out Zone 12, at a stop sign.  That's where people actually caught their taxis.  I don't know what he is talking about.  I think he is talking about something else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you take them to Small Farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I took him to Small Farm, where the taxis were shot at.  That's the white person you're talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now you would surely be able to know whether you just took them to two or three places or more than those, in other words more than three places.  Can you assist us in this regard? - as a result of the assault.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I cannot recall, but I know I took them to Sebokeng, Zone 12.  I was in a Casspir and they were travelling in private vehicles.  I also went to Djomo's place, the place that I said was a shebeen.  I don't know what other places he is talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> On your version, who instructed you to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying we were told at a meeting that was held two weeks prior.  It was indicated that we should attack Boipatong.  Themba Khosa was present.  So I really don't know where this question is leading us.  I did mention this even earlier, that we had this meeting two weeks prior and then later on the one on the 14th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Mr Nosenga, please, you're wasting time.  The question is simple, who, on your version, in other words in your mind, instructed to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The instruction came from the headmen or Indunas on the 17th.  That was on the 17th.  But I can say that Themba Khosa knew that as well because he too was present when this was mentioned.  I don't know what else to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Can you mention other names in your mind, who were part and parcel of the instruction?  I want names please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying they said: "The day has come, we should go and attack Boipatong". - people like Gatchene.  A siren or alarm was sounded on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nosenga, why don't you describe in your words what happened on the 17th.  You say there was a siren, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's the one that's used by the police.  On the 17th, that evening people were called to a meeting.  When we arrived at the meeting they said: "The day has arrived".  Darkie Chonco is one person who went to fetch the firearms from the ceiling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You said they said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>"The day has arrived"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>Who is "they"? - if you can remember.  If you can't remember, just say you can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot recall well, there were several people who were talking, but the did say that: "The day has arrived".</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> And Ntelesi was brought and placed there and they said that people should come forward and choose weapons, spears and arms, firearms.  After that we went out through the main gate of the hostel.  We proceeded and went under the bridge towards Boipatong and we crossed the robot.  That is where we came across police Casspirs at the veld near Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Lowies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you, Chair.  I'd just like to place on record, I'm not going to go into the detail as to how, which routes were taken, but Sir, there is one important thing here that I would like you to comment on.  Damarra Chonco and Darkie Chonco is not the same person, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> They are siblings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And it was Darkie that went to fetch the guns from the ceiling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, the name is Darkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Darkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I apologise.  So Darkie was the chap who fetched the guns from the ceiling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And you talk about</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>"... the people had to choose weapons, spears and firearms"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>Were these spears also fetched by Darkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Everyone of us brought his own spear, Darkie only brought along the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did he carry it all by himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot tell a lie, I did not see any other person except for Darkie, who came into the stadium carrying weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, but he was carrying it in his arms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, he was carrying them. (as the applicant demonstrates)</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Demonstrates like you would carry a baby who is sleeping, not against the chest, but with his arms forward?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, he was firearms like AK's and pump-guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So you deny two things here.  Firstly, you deny the fact that it was taken from a Nissan Skyline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know that Skyline.  It is true that Damarra Chonco owns a Skyline, but I did not see it, I did not see weapons being taken out from the Skyline.  I did not know - I am not aware that these weapons were removed from the Skyline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And there's a second thing that you deny and that is that the person responsible for the firearms was Damarra and not Darkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is not true, Damarra is being implicated falsely, but the person who was in charge of those weapons was Darkie, his brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now where was this meeting held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, it was held at a stadium, it was an open ground inside the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Who chaired the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The meeting was called by the Induna, and I do not know, I cannot be in a position to say who was chairing that meeting.  I cannot put a name and say it was Damarra or somebody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Who said you must choose weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It was Darkie Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Not Damarra?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, Darkie.  Because he is the one who brought the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And did you choose a weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> What was your age at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not remember.  I would be lying if I said I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Well from the charge sheet in your hearing, we know that when you were tried you were 17 years of age, according to the charge sheet.  So you would agree with me you were very young at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know.  The only thing that can approve my age is the birth certificate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And is it not so, Sir, that Zulu custom is as follows;  senior people get preference and the junior people must stand at the back, how come is it possible that you could get a firearm and the senior people not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> We were told that a person should choose his own weapon.  If you are 16/17, you are not a child anymore.  I don't know what you're trying to get at.  At the hostel it did not matter, those cultural rules did not apply.  Any person who was old enough went out on the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> That's not the question, the question is; senior people would get preference to the AK47's, in terms of custom, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> What I am saying is that we were told that any person can choose a weapon of his choice.  I cannot agree with you on that.  As I stated before, we were all called, it was only women and children who remained behind.  I don't know what you are trying to get at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> What I'm getting at is, your version is improbable, Mr Nosenga, you are telling lies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> With the greatest of respect, Mr Lowies, there's no evidence so far to say that people patiently queued and waited and the more senior people chose weapons first, the evidence before us so far is that it was a free-for-all.  Some people, who are the applicants, have testified that they wanted firearms, but they couldn't get in, it was a free-for-all.  So with the greatest of respect, it's not fair to call this man a liar because you're putting something to him that doesn't accord with the evidence so far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I retract the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you going to place evidence before this Committee to substantiate what you've put to the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Chair, my instructions were the following, and let me get this clear, it is normally custom, even if there's a free-for-all, that the eldest people have access to the weapons first, and in that regard the juniors should respect the elders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Forget for one moment about what your instructions are, what your instructions in regard to what happened there? - because that is the crux of what you are putting to this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> My instructions are that it is very unlikely that the events occurred as he describes them and on the probabilities he was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is was a free-for-all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, I would not disagree with that, there's no instruction to that effect.  The instruction is however, that culture would not even allow him to take part in a free-for-all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> That's the way I understood my instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.  It is one thing to be instructed as to what the culture is, it is another matter what happened on the day in question.  Now if you're putting to this witness that what he's saying in regard to the selection of weapons is improbable, unless you know you're going to put evidence to the ...(indistinct), do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I hear what you say, Chairman.  My argument is the following; I have no witness to say that he took a firearm, he didn't take one, but on the probabilities he's not telling the truth.  Those are my instructions.  And I'm canvassing the probabilities with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>	I still want to know from you in your mind, besides Khosa, who gave the instruction? - the name of a person, if you could supply us with that name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I have stated before that I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> It was not Mr Vanana Zulu, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I said before, as the siren sounded and we were informed when we arrived at the stadium that we were going to attack, I cannot commit myself and say it was Prince Vanana Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So if I put it to you that Prince Vanana Zulu did not give the instruction, you will not argue with me because you can't remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> What I'm saying is I cannot say who gave the instruction because there were several Induna there.  I cannot name one person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You can't even recall whether Vanana Zulu was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> There were several Indunas there, I was not in a position to check whether Prince Zulu was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you.  So if I put it to you as a fact that he was not present, you cannot dispute it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> What I'm saying is that I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You see again, at page 3, paragraph 10 of Exhibit A, you mention the following: State political object sought to be achieved</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>"We were instructed by Mr Zulu, who was the head of the IFP at Madala Hostel, Vanderbijlpark, to destroy ANC comrades.  He armed us with AK47's and pump-guns.  Details attached herein."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>Is this correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Will you please explain which incident you are referring to, the Sebokeng or Boipatong incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Well let's hear, let's break them up.  In the Sebokeng, were you instructed by Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But definitely not in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I've stated before, with reference to Boipatong, I cannot name Prince Zulu as the person who instructed us because there were several Indunas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And you entered Boipatong, not with an arm that Vanana Zulu supplied to you on a prior occasion or at any stage, but with one that you picked up there in the stadium, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying the firearms were brought by Darkie Chonco.  I took a firearm that was brought to us by Darkie Chonco.  I took a firearm from the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And again, Sir, I want to put it to you that in your first application you never mentioned Darkie Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did - I don't know about that, but I did mention that it was Darkie Chonco who brought the firearms along.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Is it correct, Sir, that the ANC viewed the police as the enemy in those days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> May the question please be repeated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Is it correct that the ANC views the police as the enemy in those days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Objection.  How would he know what the ANC viewed, he said he was a member of the IFP and before that he was apolitical.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let the witness tell us.  Do you know or don't you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Are you sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I don't know because I was not a member of the ANC, how am I supposed to know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Because in your statement, page 4, the second last sentence reads as follows</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>"The IFP was also assisted by senior South African Police officers, therefore I considered this as a political conflict because the ANC viewed the SAP as the enemy."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>Now how can you say this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I don't know about that.  It is true that Inkatha was being assisted by the police.  I don't know about the ANC, I was not a member of the ANC, therefore I cannot respond to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What counsel is doing, he's asking you about a statement which appears in the application for amnesty in which you state that, you state amongst other things, that the ANC viewed the SAP as an enemy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.  That the ANC viewed the police as an enemy I dispute, because I was not a member of the ANC.  I cannot therefore say that the ANC viewed them as an enemy.  No, I don't know.  The person who was interpreting for me is Sesotho-speaking, I therefore cannot say how this came into being part of the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So your version is you deny the correctness of this portion of your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I have just indicated that I don't know anything about this ANC statement or ANC thing.  I've just indicated that it was difficult to communicate because the person who was interpreting was Sesotho-speaking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Interpreting for you?  What language were you speaking to this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was speaking IsiZulu and IsiZulu was not quite clear, so I'm therefore saying that is not true that I said the ANC saw the police as the enemy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So is the position that the person who was interpreting for you was not fluent in Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, he was not fluent in IsiZulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Who was this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It's a police, I don't know his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now you have to supply particulars when making an application for amnesty, in terms of the documentation, whether you benefited in any way financially or otherwise.  No, I would not like my learned friend to show him the specific place at this stage, Chairman, could I just request through you that it does not happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> My learned friend, Ms Tanzer, indicates to him certain places on the document.  I would request that it's not done.  Not that I'm accusing her of anything, but it would not be practical.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But it's, I mean whenever you refer to the document, Ms Tanzer has been helping to point out the specific place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I hear what you say, but at this stage I would prefer her not to do so, I will indicate when it's necessary.  I'm not trying to get into an argument with her, I think it was bona fides, but I would prefer not at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>	Mr Nosenga, did you benefit in any way financially or otherwise from the acts that you committed, on your version, with a political objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did not benefit financially, I did this in the name of the IFP.  I did not receive any money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Goods, gifts, rewards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I did not benefit in any way, I did this in the name of the IFP and I did not gain financially or in any way myself as a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Lowies, may I ask the question, did the IFP benefit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I wouldn't tell a lie, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> From out of your actions, out of your conduct - you said you were doing this in the name of the IFP, my question was, out of your conduct did the IFP benefit either financially or in goods or property?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't want to tell a lie, Sir, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Have you ever met - did you ever meet Mr Eugene Terre'blanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I only see him on television.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you have anything to do with the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Have you ever had contact with members of the AWB, you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I personally have no connection with the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Have you ever seen members of the AWB in person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I wouldn't say I did see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You see, because, why I'm asking is on page 5 of Exhibit R, you state on a question</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>"Did you benefit in any way financially or otherwise from the acts committed with a political objective?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>You say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>"Yes, we were provided with groceries by the AWB, Terre'blanche, for support in the hostel."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>Now how is this possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I did not say that.  I don't know about that.  I cannot agree to somebody being pointed out to me as being Terre'blanche.  I am saying something, I'm talking about things that I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> There's a next question, paragraph (d) of paragraph 10</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>"If so, explain the nature and extent of such benefits."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>And you proceeded to state:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>"Groceries.  These were provided by the AWB, Eugene Terre'blanche, for support in the hostel."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>You say this is utter nonsense?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know about that.  Yes, whites did come to give the hostel groceries, but I don't know how, I cannot comment much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Well let me put it this way, Eugene Terre'blanche in Zulu and Eugene Terre'blanche in Sotho is one and the same person, you don't have a different name for him, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know, I'm not an educated person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> AWB in Zulu and AWB organisation in Sotho is the same organisation, it's the same name, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know.  I did say before that I am not educated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So how on earth could this happen then, that somebody wrote ridiculous comments such as this on your application?  Have you got any reasonable explanation, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying that maybe that person misunderstood me.  I was questioned on what we gained from it and I did not say that the groceries were brought specifically for me, but there were people who used to come to the hostel and bring groceries.  That person must have misunderstood me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you ever mention to anyone that the hostel residents would get support by way of food from other individuals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I might have, but I did not mention Terre'blanche's name because white people used to come to the hostel to bring food, but I cannot say it was Mr Terre'blanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But in this regard, Sir, it could be charity workers, it could be the red cross, it could be anybody, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know, I cannot dispute that.  That is possible, but I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, Mr Lowies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>	Just on this aspect, when these people who brought groceries came to the hostel, did you see them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I saw them, but I cannot say who they are.  Yes, I saw them bringing food to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did they - where would they put the food?  Where would they put these food parcels?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> They used to put it in a room, I cannot remember very well.  That's where the Indunas would meet and divide the food accordingly.  They would divide the food and distribute it into room in the hostels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did they come in private motor vehicles or what, or did they come in motor vehicles or how did they come to the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I used to see private vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Were they wearing uniform or were they wearing private clothes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Private clothes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sir, I want to put it to you that such groceries or other items that were supplied were supplied as a result of charity work, not as a result of any political objective.  Can you dispute this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I don't know.  I cannot explain, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Well we can also deduct from that answer then that it is not your contention that groceries that were supplied were supplied as a result of the political objectives of the suppliers, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Again in paragraph 11, when you had to supply particulars regarding the orders that were given to commit the offences, or the people whose approval had to be met in the organisation, you only mentioned Prince Vanana Zulu or Mtwana Zulu, as it is referred to here, and no mention is made of Darkie Chonco or Gatchene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know, Sir.  I did say that Darkie Chonco is the one who brought the firearms along.  There are instances where I was asked as to who commanded me to go and shoot at Sebokeng, I did say that it was Vanana Zulu.  Darkie was not present at Sebokeng, he did not instruct me to go and kill people there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I also do not see the name of Themba Khosa here in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know what happened, but I did mention that Themba Khosa came and held a meeting at KwaMadala Hostel.  Themba Khosa participated in the Madala affairs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And in your mind, was he part of the instruction to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I stated before, the date was initially not mentioned, but it was mentioned that Boipatong should be attacked and he was also pleased about that.  They did not specify the date at that time, but Boipatong was mentioned as the place that we should attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But that's not the question.  You must listen to the questions please.  In your mind, was Themba Khosa part of the instruction to, did he have, did he participate in the decision to attack Boipatong? - in your mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct, he was present when Boipatong was discussed.  We as the supporters did not go out to attack Boipatong on our own volition, it was the leaders who had decided.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Gatchene, did he give an instruction in your mind to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was present, but I'm not in a position to say whether he did issue an order, because a meeting of Indunas was held and they discussed this issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you know whether Prince Vanana Zulu or Mtwana Zulu's house was burnt down by the ANC comrades ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Where was this house, Mr Lowies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>	Do you know of any house of the Prince that was burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I heard him saying that his house had been burnt down in Serela.  That is in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And did he say who burnt it down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, he just said it have been burnt down, but he never explained who burnt it down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> He didn't say it was the ANC comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, he said his house was burnt down.  Do you want me to admit that it was burnt down by the ANC?  He did not tell me that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Are you trying to protect anybody in the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I'm not protecting anyone from the ANC, I'm not an ANC member, I belong to the IFP.  If he's told me that his house was burnt down, do I have to mention that it was the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> The reason why I'm asking this is, you stated, and I quote from page 5 of Exhibit R</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>"He was previously residing at Boipatong, but his house was since burnt down by the ANC comrades."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>So this is in your statement.  What is your answer now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I must have been misunderstood.  I was asked if Prince Zulu's house had been burnt down and I said yes, it was and I was questioned on who had burnt it down and I said I do not know.  I do not know why that person wrote down that it was the ANC.  There must have been a misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You see it's the second point.  I just want to make this to you, previously I canvassed this with you, I canvassed with you whether you had knowledge of the ANC viewing the SAP as the enemy, and you denied it, yet it is in your statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>	Second point, again there is a bad reflection in your statement to ANC comrades and to deny that you said it.  It appears to me that you are trying to protect somebody here, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am not protecting anyone, not the ANC or anybody else, but I maintain that I do not know anything about what you are saying.  I was not an ANC member.  You would get better clarification from an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> We're talking about you, Sir.  You on your own version are not happy with the IFP leadership, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And yet you say you are a member of the IFP, still today, here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct, I did say so even yesterday, that I'm still a member of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> My instructions are, and I have to put this to you because it's my instructions, you were planted in this application, you are not a bona fide applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did not know anything about that.  I am seeking amnesty for the incident that I was involved in. I do not understand if you say I was planted, by whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Well it appears to me that two things happened in this statement, and that is that you deny anything which is detrimental to the ANC, and it may have been them.  I'm asking you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I have not been planted by the ANC.  They would also be surprised to hear their name being mentioned here.  I have come to the TRC to seek amnesty for those acts that I was involved in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Similarly, is it not so Sir that the AWB, perhaps rightly so, is not very popular as an organisation with black people, in general, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know about the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you want seriously this witness to express an opinion as to what the attitude of black people generally is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I would submit it's relevant to the cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But how can - has this man ever taken a ...(indistinct) with the attitude of black people is towards the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'll rephrase the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just before you do, you will of course recall that it's historical fact that the IFP and the AWB at certain points had a co-operation, as part of an alliance prior to the previous election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I am apolitical, I have no idea, but if you say so, it could be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>	The reason why I want to put this to you, Sir, is ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Ask the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> The mention that you made of the AWB in your application, was to discredit the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I mentioned before that I do not know anything about the AWB.  You questioned me on whether the AWB brought groceries to the hostel and I responded that there were white people who brought food and I do not know whether they were AWB or not.  Please go onto another question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And your discrediting of the IFP goes further in your application, you are trying to tarnish the image of the President of the IFP, in this very application, in that you say he congratulated people in public for the Boipatong massacre, which is a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> If I may, it was the evidence of one of the co-applicants in fact that there was a meeting at Ulundi and he was put on the stage and he was congratulated.  So that was in evidence previously by one of the co-applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was no evidence that he was congratulated, he was taken to Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> And put on the stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But was he congratulated, was that the evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> That was the evidence, that he shook his hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was no such evidence, Ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I withdraw that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Could you answer the question please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you agree with what is put to you or do you disagree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Please explain it to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I say you are trying to discredit the President of the IFP, by stating that he publicly congratulated members of his party for the Boipatong massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I'm not trying to discredit Mr Buthelezi, I am stating what he said at Ulundi.  You are trying to protect him.  It is not the first time that he denies knowledge of events, he does this regularly.  I do not understand what you mean when you say I'm trying to discredit him.  Where do you get that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sir, if we're talking about a person denying aspects, then we're talking about you and I've already indicated to you during my course of cross-examination, that you are denying certain aspects in your own statement.  So you are the one who is telling the lies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lowies, I don't believe ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I'm not telling lies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... to get into the argument with the witness.  You've made the point, let's go onto the next point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And I would like to put it to you, Sir, that we are in the process of obtaining a statement from a person in the IFP, who will the version that you have given to us regarding what happened at Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> You can go ahead and do that, but I know what I am talking about, I'm not imagining things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Chair, is this an appropriate time to take the tea adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just before you do, Mr Lowies, I've just thought about what I've said earlier and I'm actually wrong, the alliance did not include the AWB at all, it included the Conservative Party and other parties, it definitely wasn't the AWB.  I withdraw that statement, I'm absolutely wrong on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I would not be able to dispute it, I have no knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will rise, we'll come back at half past eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, would you place on record what you mentioned to me outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Chairman, it has come to my notice that emotions are running high between the applicants and the victims.  I have been approached by one of the briefers for the victims, he advised me that he has been approached by Prince Vanana Zulu, from the section of the applicants, where they are complaining that there have been abusive remarks coming from the side of the victims and they want some intervention from the Committee.  That is the situation, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Representative for the applicants, do you have any instructions in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I heard yesterday that there were abusive remarks, but I did not take it seriously, I said to my guys they must just ignore it, Chair, and I thought the matter was over.  What happened now, I am totally uninformed about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  On the side of the victims, do you have any instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Yes, thank you, Chair.  I was present with Mr Mapoma when these remarks, when the allegations were made and we have undertaken to the Evidence Leader, to speak to our clients during the lunch break, to intervene, to sort out.  Apparently there's a misunderstanding, but we have undertaken to deal with it during the lunch break.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do we know whether these remarks were made inside or outside of this hearing room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Unfortunately, Chairperson, I am not in a position to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, would you discuss the matter with the senior police officer present at these hearings and ask that police officer to investigate these allegations and thereafter to provide the Committee with a report?  It is in the interest of both the applicants and the victims, that these hearings proceed to finality.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>	I regard it as a very grave and serious matter if there are allegations of abuse against anyone.  So I urge everyone to refrain from such conduct.  May I also urge the legal representatives to raise these issues with their respective clients, so that we do not have a repeat of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>	Mr Nosenga, you're still under oath.               </p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">ANDRIES MATANZIMA NOSENGA:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Lowies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LOWIES:</span> (Cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>	Mr Nosenga, it may be of importance to know your version, what happened to you at Ulundi?  Can you give us the details regarding yourself at Ulundi, once you were inside the stadium, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I explained yesterday, I just went to Ulundi and when I arrived I went to the conference.  I don't know what else you'd like me to explain.  Nothing happened to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Were you on a stage, were you on a podium or something similar to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I was among the members of the IFP, I was not put on stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Were you mentioned by anybody of the leadership of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You were not on the same stage as Chief Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was among the followers of the IFP and Chief Buthelezi was on the stage.  I was not among the leaders, I was among the followers or members of the IFP.  I'm not a leader of the IFP, I'm just a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You were not introduced to the chief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I was not introduced to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You were not mentioned by anybody, as a spy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, nobody said I'm a spy.  My apologies, Sir, I would like to know where you get that from because you did refer to the spy thing yesterday as well.  I don't know where you're getting this from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nosenga, you are here to answer questions, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If there are any questions that you would like to ask, you will do that through your attorney.  If there is any matter that you'd like to canvass or have clarity on, your attorney will do that on your behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>	So Mr Nosenga, to sum it up, you were just there as a normal supporter, listening and observing what is happening, nothing extraordinary happened to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't recall.  I just went there as a member of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And when the Chief Minister made his speech congratulating people on the Boipatong massacre, was he on a podium or on a stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was standing on something that looked like a stage, something that was a position that was, or a platform, an elevated platform should I say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> In other words simply put, he was making a speech and everybody could listen to him and could hear him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.  Yes, there was a system that was put in place so that everybody could hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So he was even speaking on the sound system.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't what it is, it is something that he was using, through which he was speaking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Which amplifies the sound.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, yes, maybe something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> What language did he speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot remember.  I cannot remember whether it was IsiZulu or English.  I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Because I want to put it to you that the evidence will be that there were dignitaries from other states who were invited, members of the press and so forth, and what is amazing is that nobody picked the speech up, the one that you are talking about.  Any comments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said Buthelezi delivered a speech.  Sometimes these media people write things not as they happened, but I heard Buthelezi delivering a speech.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What counsel wants you to comment on is that the speech was made in public, in the presence of the media and other persons, but in the reports following the conference, there was nothing which indicated he had made the statement attributed to him by you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>	Is that what you're putting to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Correct, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I just know that he spoke.  I heard him.  I still maintain that he delivered this speech in the presence of many other IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And Sir, I put it to you that this is another reason why, on the evidence of my clients, my instruction from them, that they say you are telling a lie, you are just trying to defame the image of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am not telling a lie, they are the ones who are telling a lie.  They are the ones who are discrediting the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now Mr Nosenga, now that we've dealt with the contents of the statements that you made and contained in Form 1 - and with your permission, Chair, may my learned friend at this stage just indicate to him which Form 1 I'm talking about, because that is on page 1 of Exhibit R up until page 7, if he does not mind.  Now that the contents of this statement has been put to you, are you able to tell us who took this statement from you, or who completed this form containing these statements?  Also the one that you've signed, just to refer you to page 6, your signature thereon.  If my learned friend could assist me in that regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> May my legal counsel please point it out to me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> From page 126, ...(indistinct).  And to assist you further, Sir, it is dated, it bears a date stamp of the Leeukop Prison, dated 25 September '96.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did explain that this statement was taken by Mongezi at Leeukop.  That is if I still remember very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you make any other statements to Mongezi or did you have any other contact with Mongezi after this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I did not get into any contact with him thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And before this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I did not get into any contact with him.  I did not get into contact with him anymore, I only contacted or got into contact with Mr Brian thereafter, when I was in Stoffberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So Mongezi you only saw once then in your life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I saw him once.  That is if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> If I could just ask him here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I think you asked him; did he have any other contact with this chap after this, he said: "No", did he have any contact with him before this, and I can't catch his answer in that regard, I don't know if he answered that at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I thought that the implication was no, but maybe we should canvass this, with respect, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Maybe Mr Nosenga you could just assist us in this.  Did you see him before this incident where he spoke to you and you made these statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.  I am saying he came to Leeukop Prison looking for Andries Nosenga and we went to Maximum C in Leeukop.  That is where the statement was taken, not at the Maximum section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Who was your lawyer in the criminal charges where you were convicted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot recall.  Which criminal offences?  Are you referring to the ones for which I was convicted, the Sebokeng incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes, the murders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, Mongezi was not my legal counsel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you have a pro deo counsel?  In other words, one paid by the state, to defend you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I don't know.  I said I don't know whether the counsel was pro deo or not.  I said I don't know.  You're putting it as if it was Mongezi who appointed counsel for me.  I don't know really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Well somebody had to pay him, you didn't, your family didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know.  I just saw a legal counsel coming to represent me.  I am saying I don't know who paid that legal counsel because he was going to represent me here at the hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, Mr Nosenga, we're not talking about this hearing, we're talking about your trial where you were convicted.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did not get him very well.  I want to know whether he's asking whether the legal counsel was appointed or paid for by my family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I'm trying to explain to you what he's asking you, so if you'd just listen carefully.  What counsel is asking you is, who represented you in your trial which led to your conviction for which you are now in jail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot recall, I do not recall his or her name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And the other question he was asking you was, did you pay for that counsel yourself or that lawyer yourself or was that lawyer provided for you by the state?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did not pay for my legal representation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Just to turn to page 6, paragraph (f) of Exhibit R, there's reference to</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>"Date of sentence if applicable"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>And it was completed, stating that it was the 1/3/1996,  would you agree with the correctness of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I was not sentenced on that day, I was sentenced on the 14th of February 1995.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Definitely not on the 1st of March 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I was sentenced in 1995.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Mr Nosenga, then I would like you to explain to us how was this possible ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just a minute.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>	Mr Nosenga, before signing the document that, before placing your signature at page 6, did you take an oath? - if you can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I do not recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this document read back to you before you signed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, Mongezi just took the statement and left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you signed, who was present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot recall who was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was yourself, Mongezi, was there any other person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It was - there were other police if I still remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you don't know whether you took an oath before putting your signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I'm saying I cannot recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now you gave him your prison number, being 95244676 at that stage, does that ring a bell, was that indeed your prison number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You told this person that you were actually imprisoned for 14(sic) years, that is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Are you saying 14 years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes 14, not 40.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry, my mistake, 14.  Now if you then turn to page 7, from this document it appears that you were requested by one, Nobewe, an Assistant Director in the Department of Correctional Services, Leeukop, to state whether you acknowledge that you know and understand the contents of the declaration, whereafter you confirm this to him and he signed it as well.  Is this a lie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not recall.  One person who came to me was Mongezi.  Mongezi is the one who came to me to take a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, but that's not the question.  You said that there was a police officer present, was there anybody from the prison present who requested you to acknowledge that you understand and that you know the contents of the declaration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it's possible, but the one person who came to me was Mongezi and I spoke to him through an interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just clarify something, Mr Lowies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a>	You keep referring to a police officer being present during all of this and someone interpreting, it was a police officer.  How come there was a police officer in the prison?  Was this - I'm just interested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying there were these prison warders, one of whom was interpreting for me and they were based in Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So just to confirm, these are not police officers, you're just using that word, but in fact you're referring to prison warders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying it is the prison security or prison warders who were interpreting for me, not the SAP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>	Mr Nosenga, then I'd like you to turn to the document which you've been referred to and which has been referred to as the unsigned affidavit, or the unsigned statement, on page 8.  I'm going to request with the permission of the Chairman, your legal assistant just to point that document out to you, all the pages, so as to bring you in the picture.  Are you now in the picture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I can see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now according to this statement you received a 16 year prison sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, that's a mistake, I was not sentenced to 16 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> According to this statement you are now, when this statement was made, you are in the Leeuhof Prison, whereas the previous statement reads that you were in the Leeukop Prison, from the date-stamp we can see there.  On page 7, Chair.  Were you ever at  Leeuhof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> May the question please be repeated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> If one looks at page 8 of the unsigned affidavit, it states that you are at the Maximum B in Leeuhof, whereas it is clear to us that Mongezi visited you at Leeukop, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But there's another mistake here, because if we look at page 7 of Exhibit R, you were in Medium C, do you agree that you were in Medium C first of all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know about Medium C.  Maybe that is where the statement was taken.  I was locked up at a maximum section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> What section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying Mongezi visited me and I was sent to Medium C, where I met him.  I was locked up at a maximum section and I was sent to Medium C, or Maximum C, where I met Mongezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Were you held at Maximum B Prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> There is no Maximum B, there is just, it's just a maximum section prison in Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there a Maximum B in Leeuhof Prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is a regional prison, that is Leeuhof.  I was transferred from Leeuhof to Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Answer the question.  In Leeuhof Prison, is there a Maximum B?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's just one small prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Where did you start to serve your sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I started serving the sentence in Leeukop Maximum Prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Were you ever in Leeuhof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> When I was arrested I was placed in Leeuhof and after sentencing I was sent to Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So you never served any sentence in Leeuhof, you only were detained there pending the outcome of your trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's were I was detained during the trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) your conviction ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> After everything had been done, I was sent to Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And for how long did you remain in Leeuhof Prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not remember, it was quite a while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But did you remain in your prison after your conviction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct, but it could not have been more than three days.  Thereafter I was transferred to Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So whilst you were an awaiting-trial prisoner, you were at Leeuhof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's where I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then after your conviction you remained there for a few days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And thereafter you were transferred to Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Leeukop Maximum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And nobody visited you for the purposes of amnesty at Leeuhof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I do not recall anyone visiting me.  No-one came to visit me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now you say nobody came, so that's a fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, no-one came.  People started visiting me at Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> The reason why I'm asking is, this statement reads that you are, when this was taken, that you are presently serving 16 years for murder at Maximum B Prison, Leeuhof.  That is completely wrong in three regards.  Firstly, nobody took a statement from you in Leeuhof, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Secondly, there is no Maximum B Prison in Leeuhof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And thirdly, you did not get, you were not sentenced to 16 years, you were sentenced to an effective 4 years imprisonment, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Then if we look at this statement again and compare it to page 6 of Exhibit R, we see that the one statement refers to a conviction and sentence on the 1st of March '96, whereas the other one, on page 8, refers to the following</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>"I was convicted in February 1995"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I can see it, but the fact is that I was convicted on the 14th of February 1995.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So page 8 in this case is correct, but page 6 is incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now it appears to me, Mr Nosenga, that it could not have been the same person - if you just look at these mistakes in the first paragraph, who took the unsigned affidavit from you, because of these mistakes that I've indicated to you.  Do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.  What I'm saying is I do not recall.  It is possible that that is what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> However, is it correct that you have a standard one education?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Is it correct that you reside at - or you resided at 671 Newman Road, Everton, until 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is incorrect.  I was born in Everton at that address.  I left in 1991 to go and reside at the Madala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So you were actually born and raised here in Everton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I was born and raised there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Where did you go to school, also Everton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I started school in Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now isn't the language that is predominantly spoken in Everton, Sotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is Sesotho, but there are AmaZulu and AmaXhosa living there as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, but I'm talking about the language that's predominantly spoken in this area, in the Vaal area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Just because the majority speaks Sesotho, I would not do the same.  I am UmZulu and my mother is Xhosa and therefore I cannot speak other people's language.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But I haven't asked you that, I asked you whether the language predominantly spoken in this area is Sotho or not, what do you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Right.  Yet you say you can't speak the language.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know that language. I can hear a word or two here and there, therefore I cannot claim to know Sesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> If you can here it, can you speak it here and there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I speak my father's language, which is IsiZulu.  I cannot speak a language that is not my mother tongue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Okay, then we know that there's another aspect which you disagree with, and that is the fact that you left the township in 1990, you say no, it was 1991, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You then say in this statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>"Themba Khosa was the Chairperson of the IFP in the Vaal Triangle"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>Do you regard this as being correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I said he was the Chairperson of the IFP Youth Brigade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> When did you say this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Please repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> To whom did you say this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I said he was the Chairperson of the IFP Youth Brigade in the Vaal or in the Johannesburg area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So you would never say that he would be the Chairperson of the IFP in the Vaal Triangle because you know it's not correct, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Ja.  I knew him to be the Chairperson of the IFP Youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> In the Vaal region.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You say in this statement that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a>"Before we left the township we performed ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a>Sorry, may I rephrase with your permission, Chairman?  The question that I would like to put to you is the following; in the statement you make mention of the fact that you were part of a group from the hostel, that is now KwaMadala, who went on the rampage in Boipatong in June 1992.  You go on to state:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>"Before we left the township we performed various rituals"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>And then you continue to say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>"Just before we were about to leave, Sergeant Peens of the SAP came and gave Katisi, Victor Kheswa some money"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a>My question relates to the last aspect, and that is that shortly before you were about to leave Peens arrived and that he gave money to Kheswa.  Is this correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.  But I just want to state that before we went to attack Boipatong, he did come to the hostel during the day.  I don't know how much it was.  I did say that, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Who came to the hostel earlier today, Kheswa or Peens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Peens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now, what was the money for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know, I did not ask him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Where was the money handed over to  Kheswa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> May the question please be repeated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Where did this incident take place, the handing over of the money by Peens to Kheswa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> They were outside the hostel at the Iscor parking area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now how long before the incident did this happen?  The incident I'm referring to is the attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It was during the day.  The attack on Boipatong happened during the evening and the handing over of the money to Kheswa happened during the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I see.  Now did you see whether any weapons were handed over to anybody at the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did not see who Peens gave firearms or weapons to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Are you sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I would not say I am sure.  I only heard, I did not see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> What did you hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I heard that Peens gives firearms to Rooikop and Rooikop in turn gives these firearms to Themba Khosa.  So I'm not in the position to say, really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So you didn't see that firearms were actually handed to Themba Khosa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I did not see Themba Khosa taking receipt of the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> As a matter of fact, on this specific day, the only thing that you observed was the handing over of the money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I saw Katisi receiving the money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And thereafter Peens left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> May the question please be repeated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you that Peens left the premises thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did because we were standing together with Katisi at the gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So if there was a handing over of firearms to Themba Khosa at that stage, you would have seen it?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.  Yes, that is something I could have seen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you see Themba Khosa at all that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I saw Themba Khosa at the meeting two weeks prior to the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Mr Nosenga, please, we're wasting time.  My question is simple, did you see him on that day, not any other day?  What is your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I did not see him on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So if one gets the impression on that day that the money, that Peens handed guns over to Khosa, that would be wrong, it did not happen on that specific day to your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I only heard about that at a meeting at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now did you tell Mongezi, to your knowledge, about Ntelesi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you still on the affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did tell Mongezi about the Ntelesi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> What did you say to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Mongezi asked me as to what we drank when we left the hostel to go and attack the people at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes and then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> We proceeded to Boipatong where we met the police.  That is where we attacked people.  That is what I told him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you tell anybody else but Ngedezi about the Ntelezi? - Mongezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot recall.  I am not sure whether I did mention this to other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you know the difference between a Hippo and a police Casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I know the difference.  I know the difference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> What is a Hippo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Hippo is the one with four wheels, the one that looks like a pig, that is what we call it, and the occupants can actually be seen through the roof and the sides.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And the Casspir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> A Casspir is something that looks like a bus, but it's a little wider and it has a door on the side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now to your knowledge, do the police use Hippos and Casspirs or only one of the two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> They used Casspirs, not Hippos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So who used the Hippos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I did not see Hippos.  The one thing that I saw personally were the Casspirs.  Those are the ones that we used on entering Boipatong.  They were actually leading the IFP followers on entering Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> There was evidence regarding a suitcase and the suitcase was described as a specific army vehicle, do you know what a suitcase is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The suitcase one I think is the one that is so high and such that you can actually see the soldiers appearing or soldiers' heads appearing through the roof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> It's not the same as a Hippo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.  No, the Hippo is something wide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> On the night of the attack, at any time, and I repeat, at any time, did you see a suitcase?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I did not see that.  I did not see soldiers at all because soldiers would not have allowed us to continue attacking people and killing people at Boipatong.  I don't want to tell a lie, I did not see soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, but I'm talking about vehicles.  Did you see a suitcase, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I did not see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you see a Hippo on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, the one thing that I saw were the Casspirs, the ones that we were using.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So you never saw Hippos or suitcases?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You see, in your statement you stated that Shaka of the Security Branch was in a Hippo on the night of the attack.  This is then obviously a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That's a mistake, I spoke about Casspirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, in fairness to the witness, the first sentence does talk about a police Casspir.  It's not my witness, but I think in fairness to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I thought I asked the question whether Shaka was in a Hippo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What Mr Berger is pointing out to you is that if you read the first sentence he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>"We were picked up by a police Casspir driven by a white man"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a>And then he goes on.  The next sentence referring to Shaka includes that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I thought there was nothing wrong with my question.  I thought maybe there was a slip of the tongue, that's why I'm confused.  Sorry, Chair.  Let me rephrase the question because I am now confused as to precisely what I asked, in the sense that I may have had a slip of the tongue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a>	I want to quote the following to you:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>"In the Hippo there was Shaka of the Security Branch"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>Now here you're talking about a Hippo and you're talking about two things, Shaka is a member of the Security Branch and he's inside a Hippo.  This is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, that is not true.  I did not talk about a Hippo, Shaka was inside a Casspir, not a Hippo.  There was no Hippo, there were Casspirs used there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now were you ever a passenger in the Casspir on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did say that.  There were four of these Casspirs.  There was not one Casspir, we had four of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You see you also go on to say that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>"There were 14 or 15 IFP members inside a Hippo"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a>That is totally wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, that's a mistake.  A Hippo is small, it can only accommodate about 10 people, not 15, because you see it has a very big engine.  I think it could have accommodated 10 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You see then it goes on</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>"Those that I remember who were in the Hippo were Gatchene ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a>And you mentioned others, I will get to that later.  That is a total lie, according to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) the opening sentence here clearly says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>"When we got out of the hostel we were picked up by a police Casspir driven by a white man"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a>And then it goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>"... in the Hippo"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a>And thereafter he uses the word "Hippo".</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I don't follow, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well if you follow it, in the context appears that he's referring to the police Casspir in which ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> If I could help you.  What he is saying ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the context.  Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No.  Maybe ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It begins by saying</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a>"When we got out onto the road we were picked up by a police Casspir ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a>I'm reading at paragraph four:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a>"... driven by a white man whose name I don't know."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a>Then it goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>"In the Hippo there was Shaka of the Security Branch, the white man known to me as Rooikop, who had red hair, Peens and our driver"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a>Okay?  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a>"There were 14 or 15 ... inside the Hippo"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>So what I'm saying is that in the context it appears that the word "Casspir" and "Hippo" were used ...(indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I see, I missed that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Mr Chair, also in fairness to the witness, when he talks about the statement can he say: "the unsigned statement", so that it's clear that it's ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As far as you are concerned, Mr Nosenga, you got into a police car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now was Mongezi part of your group of not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, Mongezi was not part of it, he doesn't know anything about this.  You asked me who took the statement, I told you it was Mongezi.  Mongezi was not part of this attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now who were passengers in your vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did say that it was, the first one was Induna Gatchene and Dondo, Stikenauw and Themba.  I've forgotten the name of the other one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now you state here that you killed eight to nine people on that night and probably injured many more.  Page 9, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I am not sure how many people I shot.  I said there could have been five houses or so that we attacked, but as to the number of people that I shot, no, I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> It would not be correct to say that you killed eight to nine and probably injured many more, that would be completely wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I am not sure of that.  I know people died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You know people died from being shot by you?  The operative words are; shot by yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did shoot people, but I cannot say how many of them died.  I cannot say exactly as to how many people I killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Would you say that you did kill people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And you had an AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Because I have not been present at the hearing where the applicants were charged, but my instructions are, and Mr Strydom will raise this with you in detail, but I just have to make the point at this stage, it's not true, there is no evidence that anybody was killed by an AK47.  The post-mortems will bear that out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot say, but I am saying that there were AK47s as well as pistols.  It is not true that people did not use AK47s during the night of the  attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is being put to you is that according to the post-mortem conducted on the bodies of the deceased, there is no evidence that anyone of them had died of a gunshot wound fired from an AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know about that, but people used AK47s.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now what I want to put to you, Sir, is again ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not activated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> What I would like to put to you again is the following;  you are not telling the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am telling the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now when did you see Themba Khosa for the first time after the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot recall.  He came to KwaMadala several times.  He used to come to KwaMadala, but I cannot say exactly when.  I know Themba Khosa.  Even if the can take me to a parade I can point him out from the rest of the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes, but my point is - and you must listen to the question, when did you see Themba Khosa for the first time after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not remember, but he did come to the hostel.  I also saw him at Ulundi, but I cannot recall exactly when that was.  I did see him after the meeting at KwaMadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I didn't catch the interpretation.  Sorry, Chairman.  Could it just be repeated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> He said he did see Themba Khosa after the meeting at KwaMadala Hostel.  That is what he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a>	What meeting are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It was a meeting of the residents of the hostel, and I saw him at Ulundi as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now when was this meeting, the very same day, the next day, two days thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Can you read?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I'm uneducated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> With your permission, Chair, may I just get a second?  I just want to consult with my colleagues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'm indebted to you, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a>	Now is it not so that Mr Khosa only arrived a day or two after, I think it's on the 18th, the Boipatong incident, and he was in the company of the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know about that.  What I know is that Themba Khosa arrived at the hostel to collect the firearms that had been used in the Boipatong attack.  It is possible that he might have arrived with the police.  What I do remember is that he came to the hostel on the 18th, to collect those firearms that had been used in the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now was Khosa an Induna at the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Which Khosa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Themba Khosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He was not an Induna.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> According to you, who was in charge of the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, there were Indunas there, because when we entered Boipatong we divided ourselves according to various streets in the area.  I only can refer you to the people I was with, people in my group.  I can only tell you about what happened in what I was involved in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, but listen to the question.  According to you, who was in charge of the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot say, there were many Indunas.  In my group Gatchene was the leader.  I cannot specify just one person because there were many people in charge, and those leaders were in charge of separate groups who went into different streets in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> We've heard, just before the lunch adjournment, that Vanana Zulu was not seen by you at all on the 17th, the day of the attack, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> You did ask me a question with regards to that and I responded that I did not see him at the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that at the meeting on the 17th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I did not see him because there were many Indunas there.  There were people like Gatchene present, so I cannot say that I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you see him at all on the 17th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did not see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Because your statement says that the people who were in charge of the attack were Mtwana and Gatchene.  That's not correct, the Mtwana part is not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, that part is inaccurate.  I said there were Indunas who were responsible for leading the attack, but in my group it was Gatchene who was the leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And Mtwana is Prince Vanana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I know him by the name of Mtwana Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And there's no other Mtwana that you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I said before, I know him by the name of Mtwana and there's no other person I know of that name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> How many times in your life - sorry, I retract that question.  Did you ever see Mr Themba Khosa in possession of firearms, of any nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I stated before, Themba Khosa came to collect the firearms that had been used in the attack.  He was in his Sprinter.  I did see him inside the hostel where he told the hostel dwellers that they should burn the property that had been looted from the Boipatong attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you see him in possession of firearms at any other stage in your life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I said, he came to collect firearms that had been used in the attack, so he did have firearms in his vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Besides this incident, that's my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know.  I only know him to have carried weapons, with reference to the Boipatong  attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And the carrying of the weapons was actually when he collected it, not when he delivered it, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You see the reason why I'm asking this is, in your statement it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a>"Themba Khosa was an Induna at our hostel"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>We know that you disagree with that portion.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a>"He also attended meetings briefings and debriefings"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>And then:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a>"He also delivered guns to the hostel on a regular basis, using his Sprinter"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a>This according to you is completely incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know anything about that.  I only said he came to collect the firearms in his Sprinter.  What I said was that he came to collect the firearms that had been used in the Boipatong attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And it's not true that he also delivered guns to the hostel on a regular basis, using his Sprinter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now in the drive-by shooting for which you were convicted, how many accomplices did you have?  How many people were involved with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> There were five of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes, who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> There was Zwee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Ntlantla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Ntlantla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Hunter Ndlovo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Victor Kheswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Also known as Ketisi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's the one, and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Is Ntlantla Xinde or not, is his surname Xinde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Who is Michael Ramakau?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He is somebody from Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Was he involved in a drive-by shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No.  I made that mistake.  There were five of us and one person was driving the car, he was not involved in the actual shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say you made a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I must have made a mistake with regards to Michael Ramakau.  It was myself, Hunter Ndlovo, Ntlantla Xinde and Victor Kheswa and Zwee, who was the driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I want to find out whether, are you saying that you made a mistake, where?  Where did you make this mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I think we misunderstood each other with the person who took the statement, Michael Ramakau was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you made a mistake or he made a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It must have been that person because I do not know anything about Michael Ramakau.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.  So the person who took down the statement, on his own included the name of Michael Ramakau?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It must be that we misunderstood each other, Michael Ramakau was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So how do you know that this statement is, or this name of Michael Ramakau is in your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I heard you reading from the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> There's one puzzling aspect though, how would the person taking down the statement know of Michael Ramakau if he was not mentioned by you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I'm saying, I may have made a mistake.  It is not the person who took the statement who made the mistake, but ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, Mr Nosenga, I don't follow this explanation.  What you're being asked is, the person who took down this statement, how would he know of Michael Ramakau unless he was told by you?  That is what is being put to you, so what's your ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I'm stating, I must have made a mistake.  It is possible that I made that mistake and he did not read the statement back to me.  I would have attempted to correct it if he had read it back to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you think that you may have made a mistake and mentioned the name of Michael Ramakau?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.  Michael Ramakau had not been present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But because the statement was not read to you, you didn't have the opportunity to correct that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So in this case you are not blaming bad interpretation as you initially did, in this instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> As I have stated I must have made the mistake, and it was not read back to me after it had been taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry, the last portion was not interpreted.  He spoke and nothing was interpreted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He said that the statement was not read back to him after it had been taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Chair, is this an appropriate time to take the lunch adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll take the adjournment and come back at a quarter to two.</p>

<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a>	Thank you, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a>	Mr Nosenga, if you look at your unsigned statement, at page 9 ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> If you look at your unsworn statement, at page 9, you say in the last sentence of your statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a>"I pleaded guilty and was defended by a pro deo counsel"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a>Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But with my earlier question this morning the impression was created - sorry, do you want to say something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, the court found me guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But the question is, earlier this morning I got the impression that you didn't know what pro deo counsel is.  Do you know what it is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lowies, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Will you please explain, I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> One has to give allowance to the fact that this affidavit, if it is that of Mr Nosenga, was not drafted by him, it was drafted by people who knew what they were talking about, using this term of pro deo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If a man says</p>

<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a>... one infers that it probably must have been a pro deo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I take the point, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>	Now I would like to explain what happened after the attack, how did the attackers ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you come to the end of the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, Chair, I'm still busy, second paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a>	After the attack, how did the attackers congregate and what happened once the attack on Boipatong where residents were involved, was now completed?  Maybe I should be more specific and ask you firstly, how did you know that this is the end of the attack, we are now finished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> From the shacks we went to the male/female hostel as well as children at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying, after the shack or after attacking the shacks we went to the Boipatong hostel, that is where we launched our last attack.  We came back and gathered and we went down the road that's going down next to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> ...(indistinct) you're now referring to, sorry?  The one that was attacked or the one, the KwaMadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> There's a mixed hostel at Boipatong, not KwaMadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know what is the name of that hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I just know it's a hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've been referring to Umkukweni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want to know, would this be Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is possible.  There are many trees actually in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So how was this hostel attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> May the question please be repeated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> How as the hostel attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> People were shot.  People who were standing outside were shot, but I did not shoot there, I only shot or fired shots at Slovo Park.  I only fired shots for the last time at the shacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So did you actually see whether these people at the hostel were hit by the bullets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Some of them fled, crying and some were shot.  I heard people crying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you actually see them fall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> If you have to give an estimate, how many would you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know, I don't want to tell a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, but I'm asking you to give an estimate, which means you can be out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lowies, when a man says: "I don't know, I can't estimate", what more does he have to say?  Unless there is something that turns on the figure, of the figures that fell down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Chair, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But he says he can't estimate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I get the point, I'll rephrase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a>	But you say that it's definitely people and not one person that fell down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You told us that figures fell down.  What Mr Lowies wants to find out from you is, these figures that were falling down, these were human beings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, because some of them cried, screamed and started fleeing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But the ones that fell down were more than one person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> There were several of them.  I cannot say exactly how many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I want to put it to you, Sir, that this hostel was never attacked.  You are telling lies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> There are people who died there, I don't know how many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And there was never any evidence prior to you giving evidence here today, that the hostel was attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying the hostel was attacked.  It's a hostel right in Boipatong and from the hostel you can proceed to Slovo Park.  People died at that hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> If you could just bear with me please, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> We request Mr Nosenga to speak out a bit louder so that we can interpret what he says.  Sometimes he swallows his words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Nosenga, do you hear the request by the interpreters?  The interpreters are saying you speak very softly and at the end it's very difficult to get what you are saying because you swallow your words at the end of your sentences.  That makes it very difficult to interpret.  When you speak, please don't hurry, slow down a little bit.  Just speak freely and leisurely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now this hostel, was it on the side of the factories or Slovo Park or KwaMadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying it is in the middle of the township.  Madala is at Iscor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And you were telling us still that the hostel was attacked and from there what happened, which route did you follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> We regrouped and went back to the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes, I know that.  The question is not whether you regrouped, the question is, can you describe the route please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> We took the main road, I think it's a taxi route and we went down towards the firms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes?  Now the main road, are you talking about Frikkie Meyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know the name of the road.  I did indicate I'm not educated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But it's a tarred road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, there are firms next to the tarred road and we have BP just there and a stop sign next to that area, and there's a section or an intersection indicating a route to Vanderbijlpark and other areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> If I show you map, will you be able to indicate to us which route you took?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a>	Chair, if we may, with reference to Exhibit J, do so with your permission.  With your permission, Chairman, may I retract this question and request that it be dealt with by somebody else.  I'm not quite au fait with these facts and I think it would be better suited if I do not pursue the matter further myself.  So if it's not a problem, I would rather retract the question completely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a>	Mr Nosenga, forget the question please.  On your version, Mr Themba Khosa collected the firearms after the attack, am I correct that this is your version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct, after the attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Where did he collect it from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The car, his Sprinter came right into the KwaMadala Hostel and these firearms were fetched from the ceiling where they were concealed and they were taken to his Sprinter, his vehicle and he said the things that were stolen from the hostel, things like clothes etc., should be burnt.  Beds were also taken and television sets.  He said these things should be put on fire to cover up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> When did he say so, that very same night or the next day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The next day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'm putting to you that this is a lie, Mr Khosa never said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He said that.  He did say that these things should be burnt.  He spoke to the Indunas, he said these things should be burnt.  I cannot say something, I  cannot suck this information from my thumb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you hear him actually giving that instruction?  That is the point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did hear him telling the Indunas.  I was there at the hostel, I did hear him say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What  actually happened, did Themba Khosa call Indunas and address them or did he call everyone else and address the Indunas in your presence as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.  He summoned all the residents, but spoke directly referring to the Indunas to say everything that was stolen should be burnt.  This message was directed to the Indunas, who would in turn tell the hostel residents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And you witnessed this?  You overhead what he said to the Indunas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I was there at the meeting, we were all there at the meeting.  I did hear him say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I want to put to you, Sir, that this is directly in conflict with your evidence yesterday where you said you were not present, he only had a meeting with the Indunas.  What is the truth?  Both cannot be true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just refresh my memory, was that in relation to the burning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> That was, as I understood it, to be in relation to the burning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because my recollection of his evidence was that the leadership would meet separately and then the decision taken at the leadership level would then be conveyed to the general membership.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> May I come in here Chair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that what you're referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, no, that was the evidence as a fact, yes, but I'm not referring to that incident.  My recollection of the evidence is the following, that they were only informed, the attackers, afterwards that Mr Themba Khosa was happy about the attack and he does not know anything regarding the meeting where Khosa allegedly was.  As you will remember the other applicants testified.  That's how I have it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But as I recall it, it was not put specifically in relation to the burning of the loot that was taken from Boipatong, as I recall the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> My impression, Chairman, is with respect that it was not directly related to that, but the incident is clear, it was that incident.  My note reads as follows Chair, if I may;  that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a>"After he left we met and we were informed by the Indunas that Khosa was happy and that he had come to collect the weapons and that he said ...(this is now what they were still informed) that the police were going to be coming to search them for weapons."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  You see my note says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a>"Darkie Chonco said these stolen items must be burnt because they would expose the hostel dwellers to arrest"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a>And then the third answer to that was:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a>"After the attack, Themba Khosa came looking for the firearms used during the attack.  He did not speak to us, we heard from IsInduna.  He spoke to them"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a>Is that the part that you're referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a>	So Mr Nosenga, the impression created yesterday was that he only spoke to the Induna and that you did not see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said Themba Khosa came after the attack on Boipatong, he came for the firearms.  A meeting was convened for everybody, but he was not speaking directly to us, he spoke directly to the Indunas, to say that everything that was stolen from Boipatong should be burnt before the police arrived because there would be police coming to search, police would be coming from Pretoria, not Vereeniging.  That is what I remember as having been asked yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>COMMITTEE DISCUSSES EVIDENCE</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>	My question to you is, Sir, it appears that you were not present because he only had a meeting with the Indunas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I was there at the hostel.  I was present when the meeting was held after the attack on Boipatong and a meeting was convened at the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> If he had a meeting with the Indunas, you would not be present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He summoned all the residents, but in his speech, or should I say he directed his speech to the Indunas in the presence of the rest of the residents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I put it to you that it's still contradictory to what you said yesterday, because yesterday - and my note is clear on this, he only had a meeting with the Indunas and they then in turn informed you about the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Regarding Michael Ramakau, you also mentioned his name yesterday - my mistake, Monday, as being part of the Kheswa gang, now today you denied that he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> You asked me about Kheswa's gang and I mentioned people like Hunter, Themba ...(indistinct).  I did not mention Michael Ramakau, I did not say he was a member of Kheswa's gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> To be fair to you, you mentioned him in the sense that he was part of the group who committed these drive-by shootings, therefore one can say that he was part of a gang.  Seen in this light, do you still ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did explain that there must have been a mistake made by myself when the statement was taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, but you made the same mistake yesterday, that's the point - Monday.  Why when it was taken and Monday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't remember being asked that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So if you said so on Monday, it was also a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> What I'm saying is, I do not recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you indicate to us where ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> The question was relating to who the fellow attackers were, and then he mentioned, he started off with Hunter Ndlovo - I think Michael was mentioned second, Mr Chairman.  You will also recall that there was an objection regarding a leading question when this was asked, but only after this was mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  My colleague has a note here which indicates that amongst the persons that you mentioned who were with you on the attack in Sebokeng, you mentioned Michael.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is possible that I may have mentioned him, but the person who was present then was Ntlantla Xinde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  No, no, we understand that but - is the question whether he was making a, he made a mistake yesterday as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.  Do you understand the question?  You see you've told us that it was a mistake on your part when you spoke to the person who took the statement from you, to mention that Michael Ramakau was also present in the Sebokeng and Everton attacks, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what's being put to you is the following;  when you told this Committee that Michael was present - I think this was during your evidence-in-chief, you're making a mistake as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's what I'm saying.  I must have made a mistake, he was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But it goes further.  The very next question after this, the one that we've debated, was whether the people in the car also took part in the shootings, and your evidence was quite clear that you can remember that Michael Ramakau was present, but you cannot recall that Victor Kheswa was present.  Sorry, may I retract?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a>	 Sorry, the question was whether the people in the car took part in the Boipatong massacre two days later and you said you can still very well remember Michael Ramakau, but you cannot recall whether Kheswa was part of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did say that.  I do not remember Victor Kheswa being present at the Boipatong attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But the question relates to Michael Ramakau.  It seems like you made the same mistake on two occasions to two different questions.  And in you tendered to this question the name of Ramakau.  What is your explanation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It must have been a mistake.  Michael Ramakau was not present in the Sebokeng attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Where does Michael Ramakau reside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> He resides at Small Farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Where did he reside in June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> At that time he lived at KwaMadala  Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I want to put it to you that he did not reside there, Sir, and that is why you're trying to take him out of the fact, out of the gang who was - wait I'm still busy - why you're trying to take him out of the gang who did the drive-by shootings, because he was not a hostel dweller.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, that is not true, Michael Ramakau resided at the hostel, he was an IFP member.  He left Small Farm for the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And now he's back in Boipatong, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> He said he's back in Small Farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> In Small Farm.  It's my mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That person is late, he is deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Where did he reside when he passed away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, I last knew the person to be residing at KwaMadala Hostel.  I did not check where he was all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But why did you then give the answer when I asked you about his residence, to say that he stayed in Small Farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was not always with Michael Ramakau, but I know that he was born at Small Farm.  That is where his home was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that where he resided before going to the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I want to put it to you, Sir, that you yourself did not reside in the hostel when these drive-by shootings occurred, just like Ramakau.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is not true.  It is not true that I did not reside at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You heard the evidence of some of the applicants, the other applicants.  My question is, whose evidence did you hear?  We know about Buthelezi, who else that you can recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did say that I do not know the names of the other co-applicants, but there were many people who gave evidence before the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Would you be able today to identify Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Would you be able to identify all the applicants who gave evidence?  Firstly, all the applicants who gave evidence in your absence and all the applicants who gave evidence after you arrived, today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lowies, let's just get to the point.  The applicant came to the hearings, he may not have been sitting in the hall, but sitting in another room where he was watching the proceedings.  Now what is the  issue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> The issue is he may not know some of them and if he was there since '91, one would have expected him to do so.  And it's part and parcel of our defence that he was not there as a hostel dweller before '91 ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> ... after '91, during '91, sorry Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well is it your instruction that everyone who was at the hostel knew one another?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But at least you expect Mr Nosenga to know everyone at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Well Chairman, my submission is the following; if they were in leadership positions, surely he would because he was a member of the IFP, on his version.  You know because they stand out, I mean it's not like a normal child or whatever, they stand ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well why don't you ask him about this, because when you ask him about everyone who gave evidence, some of those who gave evidence were not in leadership positions.  That's why I'm saying let's get to the person you want to ask him about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> As you please, Chair.  Could you just bear with me for a minute?  With your permission, may I just canvass another aspect whilst we're looking for a certain document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a>	Mr Nosenga, was Mtwana Zulu present when you attacked the people in Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Mtwana Zulu was not present when we attacked the people at Sebokeng.  He issued the command, but he was not present when the attack was carried out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Can I summarise this?  He was never present during any attack that you participated in? - to your knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's not what he said.  That's not what he's saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'm asking, Chair, I'm not putting it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but you're saying you're summarising what he's saying.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Can I ask you this.  To your knowledge, was Mtwana Zulu ever present during an attack where you took part?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> With regards to the Sebokeng incident, he was not present, but the role that he played was that he issued the order.  With regards to the Boipatong incident, I did see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And there were no other attacks where he was present, that you know of?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now that we've canvassed this document with you, who do you say did you give this information to contained in this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said a lot of people came to me and took statements from me, people like Mongezi, Brian.  I do not know which statement you are referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'm referring to the one which we've just canvassed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There is a statement which you did not sign.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Is that the one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, this is a statement where on your own you've just mentioned that it was a mistake of you to have mentioned Michael Ramakau.  Do you remember the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, now what counsel wants to find out, can you recall the person to whom you made this statement?  If you can, say so, if you can't, say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, I did mention before that it was taken by Mongezi and that is the statement that is unsigned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You think that the unsigned statement is a statement that you made to Mongezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it must be it.  Yes, because it is unsigned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see because we're talking precisely about that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.  It was the statement taken at Medium C in Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, alright.  You again have the tendency of swallowing your last words, speak up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> ...(no English interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say this is the statement you made to Mongezi in Medium C in Leeukop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a>	Mr Nosenga, I'm a bit puzzled here, because this statement says in itself in its first paragraph, that you're presently serving a sentence at Maximum B Prison in Leeuhof.  So that's the one we're talking about, the one which in it says that you are at Maximum B in Leeuhof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I'm not incarcerated in Leeuhof.  Presently I am in Sun City.  I only came this side for the purposes of the hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You're not understanding me, let me try again.  You were asked about the statement which appears at pages 8, 9 and 10 and which starts in front of you there - and your lawyer can show you what I'm talking about, you've been asked a whole lot of questions about this statement and amongst other things it's the statement where you yourself, as the Chairperson has said, volunteered the information that the mention of Ramakau must have been a mistake that you made.  Now you've just told us that this is the one that Mongezi took from you, because it's unsigned and it mentions Medium C, Leeukop.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now what I'm asking you is, this statement doesn't mention Medium C, Leeukop anywhere on it, so that's why I'm confused.  Do you understand why I'm confused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, yes, I do understand.  Two people came to me to take statements, Mongezi and Mr Brian.  The first statement was made at Leeukop.  Mongezi is the one who took the statement from me.  That was the first statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I think what my colleague wanted to clarify is that if this statement that we've been dealing with was taken in Leeukop, then as you have pointed out yourself in your evidence earlier on, it probably is a mistake in the statement when it says you are in Leeuhof.  Is that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At the moment - you're not at Leeukop at the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I'm not in Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am in a the small prison in Leeuhof, having been transferred from Sun City.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, have you been at Leeuhof since you began to attend these hearings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I only came here on Saturday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This last Saturday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  You will recall that the Committee also said at the beginning of this year, in January, I think about the 18th I think it was, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> This year?  I started attending this hearing on the 3rd, on Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The hearings started last year and we continued in January this year and you were present in January.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What's that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I was present here in January.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, when you were attending these hearings in January, were you being detained in  Leeuhof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I was in Stoffberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In Stoffberg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I was in Stoffberg in January.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that a prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that's a maximum prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that in Vereeniging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I would say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> You had always been detained at a maximum prison, not so, except for those three days waiting to be transferred to Leeukop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> At the moment I'm at the small prison in Leeuhof, but yes, it's true, I've always been detained in the maximum prisons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And the only reason why you're detained here is for transport purposes and after this you will go back to the maximum, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you come to these hearings last year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, in January, but I was in Stoffberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I mean last year, in August.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't recall because I think when the TRC sat for the first time, it sat at Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> If I may clarify?  In August he was present here at the TRC, but he was not watching, he wasn't actually, he didn't have access to what was going on here, he was sitting in the police bus and in fact at that stage he didn't hear anything in the proceedings.  Only in January was the first time he actually got access to the proceedings and heard the proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I thought so, yes.  And that was just once, was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> That was - what do you mean once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was here for one day, was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> Yes, for one day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's when you - yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Do you agree with what your counsel said, that you were here in August once in a bus and that you did not attend the hearings here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Because I can clearly recall your evidence yesterday, which was to the effect that when you were here you heard that you, or that there was a denial that the police were present at Boipatong and that as a result thereof you decided to make application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, Mr Lowies, with all due respect, ...(indistinct) with two different things.  The occasion that Ms Tanzer is referring to is when he just came here once in August and only remained in the police vehicle, bus, as the case may be, where he did not come in either in this hall or sit elsewhere to watch the proceedings.  That is what he is referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes, precisely my point.  I would like to explore this ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Explore what when - you want to find out whether he was watching the proceedings from the police vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I would like to know how it happened that he said "when he was here", because that was what bothered us yesterday.  How it could be said that he was here if he didn't attend the meetings, and now we know something new, which we didn't know yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No.  When he came to attend these hearings, when he began to attend these hearings he was not sitting in the hall, he was sitting in another area where he was watching, I gather, the proceedings on a TV monitor ...  That is what he was referring to.  That is when he saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> That's what he said at one stage, I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But he did also say when he was here last year he heard this.  And I thought - sorry, maybe I misunderstand you, may I just get ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a>	When we talk about here, we're talking Iscor Club where we are sitting today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No we're talking - they're talking about him arriving on the last day of the hearing at the Sebokeng College, not here.  I beg your pardon, I'm getting just as confused as you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> If that is the case, Chairman, his evidence is clear that he heard "here", and that's what ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Put the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> ... and that's what concerns me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a>	Mr Nosenga, when you gave evidence yesterday you were cross-examined about this quite a lot and one of the answers that you gave was; when you were here, referring to this place, you heard that there was a denial that the police were involved in the Boipatong massacre.  Do you agree with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In fairness to him also mention to him that he also said that when he was watching television in prison he saw the hearing and heard that the people were not telling the truth, that he referred to the snake incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Chair, I don't think it would be fair to say that because that would be wrong.  The way I have it is, the only thing that he heard in prison ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I am saying to you, also indicate that to him as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I will do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a>	Mr Nosenga, let's just hear this.  Did you hear in prison, when Mthembu gave evidence, that there was a denial of police complicity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I heard him when I was in prison.  I was watching television whilst in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But the only aspect that was on TV was that he said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a>"a snake gives birth to a snake"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a>He did not talk about police complicity on TV.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did say that, Sir, yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm puzzled now.  Are you putting it as a fact to this witness that the only footage that was shown on TV was that incident where he, the only incident that was shown on TV, was that relating to the snake and nothing else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'm putting to him that on that footage there was nothing said about the absence of police complicity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that a fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Those are my instructions.  But let's hear what he says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I mean ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... it isn't a fact, because if it is a fact we can establish that by getting the SABC ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I will rephrase the question.  I follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... to provide us with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry, Chair, I follow.  I will rephrase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>	Mr Nosenga, did you also hear when the evidence of Victor was on TV, that there was an absence of police complicity, that that was denied that the police were present in other words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, I am saying, I heard him saying</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a>"a snake gives birth to another snake"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a>And these were - Sir, I said Victor said, Victor kills a snake and if a snake gives birth to another snake he will kill the snakes.  And he was also asked, he continued to say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a>"When Shaka went out on a battle he would come back with a loot like live cattle etc"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes, but answer the question.  The question is, did you hear that he denied police complicity on TV, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said - I am saying there were others who denied the complicity of the police, but I specifically heard Victor Mthembu when he spoke about the snake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> So you did not hear Victor speak about the absence or the presence of policemen in the attack, yes or no? - on TV, nowhere else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying, during the news on SABC 1 you don't get the whole coverage, you just get pieces of information.  He spoke about being a Zulu and he also gave an anecdote on the battles that Shaka got engaged in, where he brought home live livestock after the battle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes, and therefore nothing was said by him regarding the police, whether they were there or not.  That's a fact, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said I have already indicated my position, I don't know what else to say.  I don't know what to say now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> The answer is a simple yes or no.  Did Victor speak about police complicity? - nothing else.  Yes, he did, no, he didn't.  That is the question. - on TV.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I am saying I cannot answer that question because I cannot say whether he spoke about the police or not, but yes, there are people who came forward seeking amnesty, people who spoke about the complicity of the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now once we know that you can't say whether he said that, your knowledge is therefore not the following, and that is Victor did mention the absence of police complicity, on TV, because you do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now you have to explain what you said yesterday, because you said you heard here that they were lying when they said the police were not involved.  Why did you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I said some of them said the police were not involved.  I don't know what you're trying to say.  I think you're trying to say I'm lying.  I was only watching this on television.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, listen to the question.  We're finished with TV now.  It's a simple question.  And you repeated this, you said it at least four times, and that is that you heard here that they were lying about police complicity.  What did you mean by that?  When did you hear this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was not in this hall, I was in another room, not in this hall.  I was in another room where I was watching the proceedings on a monitor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But it was here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> ...(no English interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> There's no interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Not in this present venue, in another room on the premises where I was watching the proceedings on a monitor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I see.  And you went further, when questioned on Monday by the Chairman, to state that that prompted you to bring your application for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I am saying I was affected.  I am saying I was affected.  I was involved actually in the Boipatong incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes, that you also said, but forget about that, we're now dealing with your motivation.  You specifically said, yesterday also, but especially on Monday, that when you heard these lies that made you decide to bring your application, the lies pertaining to the police who were present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Sir, I am saying I was involved.  I heard that the people were not telling the truth before the Commission.  You see the people of Boipatong lost their children and people died, that's what I said.  That's the reason why I came to the TRC to seek amnesty, to say what I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And also because they were lying when they denied complicity?  That's the question, still the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> The truth is not coming out here, Sir.  We cannot conceal the truth before the TRC.  People should tell the truth so that they can be pardoned.  They should tell the truth about what happened on the 17th of June 1992, at Boipatong.  They should tell the truth about the shooting and the killing of people in the houses and the streets.  There is one child who is confined to a wheelchair right now, she has no future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'm talking about your motivation, Sir ....(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lowies, this was canvassed yesterday and the day before yesterday.  If you have a specific point to make in this regard which you haven't made, put it to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I want to put it to you that because - I will retract.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now I want to put it to you that it was only then, when you were here in August, when you heard on a separate monitor that there were allegations that the police were not present, that you decided to apply for the first time for the Boipatong massacre, for amnesty regarding the Boipatong massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I don't know what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And further, Sir, if it is true - just to prove to you that this is the situation, if you have a look at page 7 of Exhibit R, it is dated 25 September '96.  That's when the statement was taken.  You have no reason to doubt that, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, Mr Lowies, you keep doing this and it gets very, very confusing.  You keep saying "that's when the statement was taken" and you keep referring to this Form 1 as a statement.  It's not a statement, it's an application form for amnesty.  If you would separate out, maybe he'd begin to get the picture a bit better.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I hear you and I will do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a>	Now when I refer to page 7, I mean the application, the document, the one that is now being shown to you by Ms Tanzer.  If you have a look at that, do you have any reason to doubt that it is dated, and that this document was completed 25 September '96, when Mongezi was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot say I'm sure.  Yes, it is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> If you look further, at page 10 of Exhibit R, then it appears that this document must have been intended to be signed by you in June '96. - the very last page.  Now how is this possible, that you complete the form and you have a discussion with Mongezi in September, yet he intends you to sign this document in June, which is three months before?  That is funny.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> I object.  In fairness to the witness, I mean to the applicant, he can't answer what Mongezi did or intended to do or didn't intend to do.  As he said he's never seen the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what counsel wants to find out - and just listen carefully, Mr Nosenga, and if you don't understand the question let me know, I will repeat the question to you in Zulu.  The application for amnesty which you've signed is dated the 25th of September 1996, and it indicates that it was signed at Leeukop Medium C Prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then comes the unsigned affidavit, which you have told us was probably drafted from a statement that you made to Mr Mongezi.  That unsigned statement indicates that it was to be signed in June of 1996, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> ...(no English interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because there is a date June 1996 in it, and the exact date in June was still to be filled in and you were still supposed to sign it, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> ...(no English interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry Chair, there's no interpretation.  I think it's because he doesn't speak in the mike.  I didn't get the answer to that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said he understands what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He understands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words, your affidavit and the statement which gave rise to the unsigned affidavit, were all prepared some time in June, before you made your application for amnesty, which is dated September 1996.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What's the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Therefore, Sir, it appears on the face of these documents, that your unsigned affidavit was backdated and it was not taken in September.  It could not have been taken in September, on the face of the documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I don't know, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Excuse me, Mr Lowies, if you look on page 1 of the statement, there is a date on which this application form was apparently faxed, and the date is the 15th February 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> No, but I think it was an empty application form.  An empty application form was faxed to the place, to be completed.  So it arrives at wherever this is, as an empty form.  It doesn't mean that it was completed at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And also there is a date up there, 23rd September 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> The question I want to ask, is it perhaps not possible that this form was completed and there were some outstanding, either information, or it was not attested before the Commissioner of Oaths and then it gets returned by the TRC to say: "Please have it attested before the Commissioner of Oaths".  I'm asking that as a possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'll investigate that, I can't give an answer.  Because Chair, I hear what you say but you see all these - with respect, and if I might bring this point us now, that is why there is a substantial application to have this matter fully investigated.  There are so many unanswered questions which we do not know and we haven't got access to those documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I told you repeatedly that raise those matters up with the TRC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you, Chair, I'll do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We are at these hearings, we don't have those documents here.  And only if you have difficulty in getting those documents, then come back to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'll make sure that you get those documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a>	Now Sir, if we turn to page 11, this is a second application for amnesty by yourself - wait, before we proceed to page 11, I'd just like to make the following point as well and give you the opportunity to answer.  It appears to me further, Sir, that if one has a look at the discrepancy in the dates which I have indicated to you, and if one has a look at your evidence yesterday, today and Monday, that one of the reasons that prompted you, that motivated you to bring an application for amnesty was only when you heard the denial of police complicity, clearly indicates that this document was backdated.  And I'm talking about you unsigned affidavit.  If you read all those together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know that's a matter for argument.  I'm not too sure that the applicant can ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I will argue it later.  I agree with you, Chair, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... can explain that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> If I have interrupted, I'm sorry, I just wanted to ...  I apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a>	Now just one aspect regarding page 11, before we start with that.  Why was it necessary for you to file a second application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now are you on the second application, starting at page 11?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Page 11.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So we're finished with the affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> We have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a>	Mr Nosenga, page 11.  There is a second application for amnesty on page 11, which has been canvassed with you before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just refresh my memory, did he say that what occurs at page 13 is his signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> He denies it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He denies it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now, Mr Nosenga, I'm going to put the contents of this application to you, on page 11 and further.  The form has now been shown to you by Ms Tanzer - and with your permission, Chair, may she page through the pages, pages 11 up until 13 and up until the place where his name is - now you see that is now being shown to you, do you deny that this document was signed by you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I cannot see this properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Sorry yes, let me give you a better one.  There's a better copy available, Sir.  We had a problem yesterday as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I can see the signature, it is possible that I signed here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Let's examine the contents ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nosenga, just tell us, is that your signature or don't you know who signed there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did state that, I did indicate where my signature was appended.  I do not think that was mine.  I would just like to know where that statement was taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, we will come to the, we will probably come to the statement, but all we want to find out is, did you sign the document there.  You see on its face this documents indicates again that it was signed at Leeukop Prison I think, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> It is possible that I signed it at Leeukop.  I would like to know who took this statement because there was one that was signed and one that was unsigned.  Was this statement also taken at Leeukop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well on its face that is what it indicates.  But all I want to find out at this stage is, is the signature above the name "Deponent" at page 13, your signature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, that is not my handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I'm indebted to you, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a>	Now Mr Nosenga, I'm going to put the contents thereof to you and find out whether you agree with the correctness thereof.  Unfortunately I'll have to ask you to turn to page 13 again, because it appears from this that a certain Peter Daniel Magesa was the Commissioner of Oaths who attested to this ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> On the face of it, it says Magesa Daniel Peter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> It could be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Whichever way around, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I will rephrase it as such, that a certain Magesa Daniel Peter - ja, Peter could be a surname, attested to this.  Do you know this person, either by the name of Magesa Daniel Peter, or Peter Daniel Magesa or Magesa or Peter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> No, I do not, I'm hearing it for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now it states  here that your date of birth is the 4th of June 1973, it can't be.  Sorry, Chair, to assist you, this is page 11, paragraph 5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I have stated before that I do not know when I was born.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> And it also states here in paragraph 3, that you reside at Newman, spelt N-E-W-M-A-N, Sebokeng, Everton, Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I resided at 671, Newman Road in Everton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Now in this statement you were requested, in paragraph 9, to supply particulars of any acts or omissions which was committed in the furtherance of the political objective, and you were requested to supply detail.  You supplied the following detail</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a>"We were sent by Baba Mtwana Zulu, member of the IFP, to go and assassinate ANC members"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a>Now my question is, do you know a person by the name of Baba Mtwana Zulu? - Baby.  It's not clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> He's been calling you Baba all day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> ...(indistinct) Baba.  I'm sorry, Chair.  It makes sense to me now.  I retract the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a>	Now can you recall that on a second occasion you filled in or you were required to give particulars to a person to fill in a form and that you supplied these particulars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did say, Sir, that I am uneducated, I could not have filled in a form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> However, is it not true that if you have a look at page 11, paragraph 9.A.2, that where it is stated</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a>"I do not remember the date and month, but it was in 1993, early"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a>... that you could not have committed anything wrong there, on your version, as you have given it to the hearing here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> It is clear from the date, 1993, that on your version here you could not have committed anything in 1993, because you say everything happened in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MS TANZER:</span> With respect, Chair, he has claimed that, he hasn't claimed ownership to this document or having signed this document or given in formation relating to this document, so by referring to this as his information is misleading the Chair and himself, the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> But it's not put to him that he supplied ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I think in questioning him you've got to bear in mind that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I will rephrase it, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... that the information that may be here may coincide with what happened, but he doesn't say that.  He denies this application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> I see.  To put it differently, did you tell anybody that you committed acts at Sebokeng, Zone 12, in 1993?   (2) and (3) read together, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do not remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you tell anybody as indicated on page 12, paragraph 4, that the nature and particulars that you supplied was to kill supporters of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> What incident are you referring to, the Sebokeng or the Boipatong incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> On the fact of this document it refers to Zone 12, Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did state that Mtwana ordered us to kill ANC comrades in Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Did you state to anybody that quite a number of people died in the incident at Sebokeng, Zone 12?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, I did say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR LOWIES:</span> Very important too is the next paragraph</p>

<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I do understand that.  I say I was not given any money to go and kill people.  I was doing everything in the name of the IFP, I was not doing it on my own.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> Yes, it's possible I signed here because this is my name.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a>	Can you remember whether before the Truth Commission even existed, during the time when the political parties were negotiating, whether you ever applied to some government department to be released from prison because what you were, what you had done was an act of a political nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I think I applied for indemnity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And do you remember writing a letter about what happened and what you had done in connection with that indemnity?  I'm not saying you personally wrote it, somebody must have written it for you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And what was the outcome of that application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I did not get any response until my lawyer showed this to me.  There was no result.  I did not get any response.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see the document on page 14 is actually a letter from the Office for Indemnity that was processing these applications, addressed to you while you were at Leeukop Prison and what it says basically is that your application can't be finalised and that it gives reasons why.  It was sent on the 11th of September 1996.  In fact it's dated the 27th of July '95, I beg your pardon, and it was purportedly received by someone who signed for it with your name, in August 1996, 19th of August 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a>	So do you remember ever getting a letter saying look, your application for indemnity can't proceed just yet, but in due course something will happen?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you do remember writing some letter attached to the form about it, or having a letter written or a statement or something like that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is correct.  I was sentenced on the 14th of February 1996, sentenced to 14 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, the interpreter has just said 1996, the document says '95.  I'm just not clear, because the witness is agreeing with this, but I'm just not clear what's going on.  Was there maybe a problem with the interpretation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I was sentenced in 1995, on the 14th.  I was sentenced to 14 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Yes, Mr Lowies?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> I spoke in IsiZulu and he spoke Sesotho.  Many inmates at Leeuhof speak Sesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You spoke to him in Zulu and he spoke to you in Sotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOSENGA:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  We'll adjourn and reconvene at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>
