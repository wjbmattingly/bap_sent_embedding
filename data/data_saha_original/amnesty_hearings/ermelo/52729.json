I would appreciate it, and I can guess because a lot of people showed displeasure here when I refused you the permission to put a question related to a matter that is not pertinent to this application.

            "I am doing it on my own accord, thank you.  Mr Chairman, I just want to take you quickly through the case law as far as I gather the rules applicable to an application for recusal.\n\tIn the S v Maseko 1990 (1) SACLR (107) (A), it is stated in Afrikaans and I am quoting the principle that is applicable for this whole matter for recusal from a legal official is that the law without suspicion, must be followed.  Not only must this official present this case impartially and also with an open mind, but nothing in his actions must or can be connected that would give reason that justice is not done.\n\tFrom this decision it would seem that the test has to do with the perceptions of the reasonable person.\n\tThen I refer you to S v Radebe 73 (1) SA 812 (A) where Appellate Judge Roelf said with regard to applications for recusal and I quote a Court looks at the impression which would be given to other people, even if he was as impartial as could be, nevertheless if right minded persons would think that in the circumstances, there was a real likelihood of bias on his part, then he should not sit and if he does sit, his decision cannot stand.\n\tThis was confirmed, referred to and confirmed in Munnik & Others v The Council of Review & Others (C), Friedman, Howie and Conradie 1989 (4) SA 866 and I quote from the heading - the test for bias is that a Judge should recuse himself if there is reason for fear of partiality on his part.\n\tThat test is more stringent when non-judicial tribunal performing functions indistinguishable from the judicial process, since public would expect it to behave exactly like a court of law.  And in the case of Schultz v Chairman Personnel Advice Committee of the Municipal Council of George, 1983 (4) SA 689.   This decision follows this principle but we are dealing with a kwazi judicial issue here before this forum and the issue was if the Chairman of such a Committee was the subject for a recusal and then it has bearing on the whole Committee.\n\tThen I would like to refer you to a decision (E) Kicky v Commissioner of Correctional Services & Another 1992 (2) SA 269, Judges Kannemeyer and Ludolf applied the test and confirmed that it is the fear of biased expressed by the applicants which is to be considered.\n\tThen I would like also to refer to another case reported in 1996 (9) BCLR 1221 (T).  I quote from page 1229 at (i), the law in respect of the test for bias has recently been settled in the case of BTR Industries South Africa v Metal and Allied Workers Union where Appellate Judge Hookster stated in Rex v Connie & Another, Judge President Krause made the following observations which in this country are as pertinent now as they were some 60 years ago.  It is a matter of the gravest public policy that the impartiality of the courts of justice should not be doubted or that the fairness of a trial should not be questioned, otherwise the only (indistinct) of the liberty of the subject in these times of revolutionary tendencies would be undermined.\n\tThen on page 1230 at (c), I quote further, the law does not seek in such a case to measure the amount of his interest.  I venture to suggest that the matter stands no differently with regard to the apprehension of bias by a lay litigant provided the suspicion of partiality is one which might reasonably be entertained by a lay litigant, a Reviewing Court cannot so I consider, be called upon to measure in a nice balance, the precise extent of the apparent risk.\n\tIf suspicion is reasonably apprehended, then that is the end of the matter.\n\tLast case but one that I would like to refer to is the one of BTR Industries South Africa 1992 (3) SA 673 (A) and I quote from the heading, Appellate Division decision, the test to be adopted in a recusal application is involving the appearance of bias is whether there exists a reasonable suspicion of bias on the part of the decision maker.",

            "... is whether there exists a reasonable suspicion of bias on the part of the decision maker.  An apprehension of a real likelihood that the decision maker will be biased, is not a prerequisite for disqualifying bias.  The very objects which the reasonable suspicion test are calculated to achieve, would be frustrated by grafting onto it the further requirement that the probability of bias must be foreseen provided that the suspicion of partiality is one which might reasonably be entertained by a lay litigant, a Reviewing Court cannot be called upon to measure in a nice balance, the precise extent of the apparent risk.\n\tIf suspension is reasonably apprehended, then that is an end to the matter.  The last case is the Supreme Court judgement, Cape of Good Hope Provincial Division, S v Collier 1995 (8) BCLR 975 (C) where it is stated on page 978 at (g) to (i) it was an appeal pertaining to an application for recusal, turning to the matter of the appeal, it is true that justice should not only be done, but manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.\n\tIt is for this reason that South African courts have not hesitated to set aside proceedings where a person challenged, has so associated himself with one of the two opposing sides, that there was a real likelihood of bias or where reasonably lay people would get the impression that he would be biased.\n\tSouth African law has developed to a stage that disqualifying bias will be found to exist where the reasonably lay observer would gain the impression that there is a real likelihood that the decision maker will be biased.\n\tMr Chairman, the golden threat that runs through all the judgements is that we are dealing with a subjective perception on the part of a litigant or on the part of a party, or of an interested party.",

Isn't that our job?\n\tLet us look at Section 4(b).  It reads and in my view crisply defines the position of victims or their next of kin, and I might add this is only one of the examples in this whole Act.  One of the functions of the Commission which includes the Amnesty Committee for this purposes, and I am going to read it slowly, is to facilitate and initiate or coordinate the gathering of information and the receiving of evidence from any person including persons claiming to be victims of such violations or the representatives of such victims which establish the identity of victims of such violations, their fate or present whereabouts and the nature and extent of the harm suffered by such victims.\n\tPerhaps it would be well to read Section (c) as well so that we are able all to by comparison and equating to understand this different interest.  Section 4(c) reads as follows:  That one of the functions of the Commission is to facilitate and promote the granting, promote the granting of amnesty in respect of acts associated with political objectives by receiving from persons desiring to make full disclosure, of all the relevant facts relating to such acts, applications for the granting of amnesty in respect of such acts and transmitting such applications to the Committee on Amnesty for its decision and by publishing decisions granting amnesty in the Gazette.\n\tNow Mr Hattingh, that in a nutshell is basically what the two interest parties are and from where they derive their rights.  If one has respect and understand the Act, then one ought to see where the rights of victims are placed.  It is not the first time I mention this and I mention specifically so that each and everyone understands the law.\n\tI say that one can criticise the law like you want to, the fact of the matter is I have to follow it.  I say so not to make excuses, I am pointing out my duty and that of the Committee.\n\tNow, I appreciate your position in making the submission, but really I hope that you can explain on a more informal manner the status of different people.
