            "Thank you.   One of the sections of the Act that I would like to refer you to is Section 4(c), no, sorry, 4(b), functions of the Commission.   Now, although I've been shown that the Commission is not the Committee, the whole of chapter 6 and 7, I believe, where applicable, also applies to a Committee, where it makes reference to a Commission.   However, if we can just go back to what is applicable to a Committee, that is Section 19.5(a), it tells us that\n\"The Committee shall, for the purpose of considering and deciding upon an application referred to in sub-Section 1, have the same powers as those conferred upon the Commission in Section 5(l) and (m) and chapters 6 and 7.\"\n\tNow, at this moment, we're looking at Section 4, and perhaps I should skip that, because that is not part of the powers which is also conferred on the Committee.   However, in Section 5(m), 5(m) is specifically one of those powers which the Commission has which is also conferred on the Committee, and Section 5(m) tells us:-\n\"The Committee on its own initiative, or at the request of any interested party, inquire or investigate into any manner in terms of this Act.\"\nWhich I would submit tells us that this Committee can take cognisance of whatever information could provide a fuller picture.\n\tThen I would also like to refer to Section 19.2, where it is stated that:-\n\"The Committee shall investigate the application and make such inquiries as may be necessary.\"\nWhat I would submit in this regard is that this power of the Committee, as it is stated in Section 19.2, is in sequence at the stage where prior to a public hearing, but this power of the Committee does not stop, it does not cease.   So this power to investigate and make inquiries continues and this Committee, to enable it to get your fuller picture, still need to take that action.\n\tAnd then again in Section 28, that's in chapter 6, investigations and hearings by the Commission, now this is the chapter which also, the powers in which the Committee present is also entitled to use is Section 28.4(a):-\n\"To investigate any matter falling within the scope of the powers, functions and duties of that Committee.\"\nAnd I believe that this problem that we're dealing with at the moment is also such.\n\tAnd then sub-Section 5 of 28:-\n\"Subject to Section 33, no article or information obtained by the investigating unit shall be made public...\"\nAnd it then continues:-\n\"...until the commencement of any hearings in terms of this Act which is not held behind closed doors.\"\n\tAgain article as described in Section 1, meaning of the word:-\n\"All the information obtained by the investigating unit shall be made public the moment this hearing commences.\"\n\tThen Section 29.1(b), it is stated that:-\n\"By notice in writing, the Committee can call on any person who is in possession of or has the custody of or control over any article or other thing which, in the opinion of the Commission, is relevant to the subject matter.\"\nI believe that we have something which is relevant to the subject matter.\n\tAnd then in 29.5, the third line:-\n\"The Commission may, having due regard to the principles of openness and transparency, declare that any article produced or information submitted at such investigation shall not be made public until the article is produced at the hearing in terms of this Act.\"\nOnce again, it would indicate that anything obtained for the purpose of the principle of openness and transparency, should become public and should be investigated, should be scrutinised.\n\tThen we may just again refer to Section 31 again, we discussed it, or I made certain submissions with that in regard to Section 31.   In fact it would appear that Section 31 is applicable to this Committee, as already indicated in Section 19.5(a), which incorporates chapters 6 and 7, where it is clear that a witness or a person can be compelled to produce any article, once again as set out in Section 1, meaning evidence, documents, whatsoever, and they can be compelled to answer any question put to them.\n\tAnd sub-Section 5:-\n\"Any person appearing before the Commission by virtue of the provisions shall be entitled to peruse any article referred to in that sub-Section.\"\n\tAnd then, one last thing is that the Act also makes provision in Section 32 for the Commission, and that would include the Amnesty Committee, to enter upon premises and to search for and seize and to remove articles, and once again article as described in Section 1, and the basis on which that can be done is that:-\n\"upon reasonable grounds suspected to be concerned with any matter which is the subject of any investigation.\"\nOr in sub-Section (b):-\n\"on reasonable grounds suspected to contain information with regard to any such matter.\"\n\tNow I believe that had this document been in the custody of someone and we didn't know what the contents were and we wanted to, but we know that it was in existence, then this section could very well have been used to obtain this document, because, on the face of it, reasonable grounds exist to suspect that this document could assist us.\n\tMr Chairman, I'm not going to take it any further.

If one starts off with the preamble, referring specifically to victims, what does it say about victims there?   It starts off by saying it wishes to determine or deal with the facts or whereabouts of victims of any of the violations and affording victims an opportunity to relate the violations they suffered.\n\tThen we move on to Section 11 of the Act, that's 11(d):-\n\"When dealing with the victims, the actions of the Commission...\"\nand in this, here you can read Committee:-\n\"...shall be guided by the following principles.\"\nIt sets out the various principles, and when (d), as far as little (d) is concerned:-\n\"Victims shall be informed, through the press and any other medium, of their rights in seeking redress through the Commission, including information of\n(i)\tthe role of the Commission and the scope of its activities;  and\n\t\t(ii)\tthe right of victims to have their views and submissions presented and considered at appropriate stages of the inquiry.\"\n\tThen, if we move on to Section 30, which forms part of the chapter in terms of where Commission can be read as Committee, 30 dealing with procedure to be followed at investigations and hearings of Commission, Committees and sub-Committees.   \n\tWe then refer specifically to sub-Section 2, that's Section 30.2, it says:-\n\"If, during any investigation or at any hearing before the Commission...\"\nread Committee, little (a) talk about implicated person, and little (c) deals with victims, it appears that any person may be a victim, it goes on:-\n\"...the Commission...\"\nCommittee:-\n\"...shall, if such person is available, afford him or her an opportunity to submit representations to the Commission within a specified time with regard to the matter under consideration, or to give evidence at the hearing of the Commission.\"\n\tNowhere in this Act are victims afforded a right of cross-examination, but they are required to come before the Committee, make representations, set out the basis upon which they wish to make the representations, should they wish to oppose any application, the clear grounds and basis of their opposition must be placed.    This is not a court of law and I am pleased that Mr Hattingh has perceived that.\n\tIf, out of the sub-rules and a sense of fairness, the Committee has afforded victims the right to cross-examine, as opposed to the right of being legally represented and making representations, then I wish to refer the Committee again to the provision of Section 34 of the Act relating to representation, and specifically to Section 34.2, where:-\n\"The Commission...\"\nwhere you can read Committee:-\n\"...may, in order to expedite proceedings, place reasonable limitations with regard to the time allowed in respect of cross-examination of witnesses or any address to the Commission.\"\n\tThis is one of the issues which was raised.   The other issues have already been dealt with by Mr Hattingh and conceded to by him, about the applicability of the usual technical, evidential and procedural rules which apply to courts, conceding that they do not directly apply here, but that my submission, as I've already said and don't want to repeat, is to achieve the aims and objectives set out in the preamble of this Act, and I may say it's a pity that it's  fairly, it's a shortened version, it was fairly long, but I wish, perhaps I may suggest that at some stage, for the sake of the community, this be read out in full at some stage of these proceedings.\n\tNow, as far as the victims, before I leave the victims, are concerned, one of the issues raised was whether or not, what's the right of victims simply to come here if, the exact wording was something about the nature and extent of the opposition perhaps, may I put it briefly, of a person who wishes to oppose, to what extent should that be allowed?  My submission is that any opposition and any victim has a right to make representations to this Committee and be legally assisted in making such representations.   Insofar as the extent and nature of any cross-examination is concerned, that I submit is an indulgence granted by the Committee and in order perhaps as to be seen to be fair.",

I must confess that to date I have not yet, I am not clear as to, first of all, what basis the opposition is, the victims must clearly make representations to this Committee, the victims, as the preamble says, must be granted an opportunity to relate the violations they suffered, and if their representations to the Committee is one of a form of opposition, then I submit that it must be clear on what basis, on what grounds they are opposing the matter, because this cross-examination and the lengthy delays that can ensue are, it's mind-boggling, it defeats the whole, undermines the whole objective and purpose of these proceedings.\n\tAt present I get the impression, and most of the parties here are represented by legal representatives, but the impression I get is, someone comes along and says \"oppose\", you get served with a summons, you go to your lawyer and you say \"oppose\", but on what basis?   We must be told, and as applicants we want, we wish to know on what basis this opposition is being made.   We on one day hear that it's being opposed because of motives, the other day we hear that it's being - well I don't know on what basis that he's not telling, there's no full disclosure.   We can't chop and change.   My respectful submission is that a victim cannot simply come and oppose, without making representations and setting out the basis to the applicant.\n\tNow, from an evidential point of view, with regard to these particular documents, it is clear that insofar as this particular applicant, Mr Gushu, is concerned, he has already stated that he was tortured and acted at all times under duress from the date of his arrest.   \n\tNow, furthermore, it is perhaps not that clear, but I can inform the Committee, and I'm certain that my learned friend for the victims is aware of the fact that the sole basis upon which the Court, in convicting Mr Gushu, relied upon, the sole evidence was the evidence of a pointing out and a confession, and those confessions, as were obtained under duress, but to assist my learned friend as far as the basis or his argument relating to the fact that on the face of the confession it was lawfully obtained, and his information obtained from the investigating officer corroborates that, I just by way of analogy wish to refer the Committee to one or two cases, which I submit are perhaps in point.\n\tThe first matter is the case of the S v MVELASE 1997(2), the October law reports of the South African criminal law reports, just to, it relates to a confession, about the before and the after effects of coming into effect of the constitution.

            "That is correct.\nRULING\n\tAt this stage I am asked to make a ruling on the following aspect, and that is as to whether the applicant can be questioned about the content of a written document purporting to reflect the events relating to pointing out and contemporaneous notes of his pointing out at the time the criminal investigations were being conducted.   These criminal investigations relate to his convictions and sentence which are presently under discussion.\n\tI may mention that it is a pity that I have been called to make the ruling, and the matter not being settled by the representatives.\n\tBe that as it may, we have been asked to rule on this aspect, especially because it seems the voluntariness of the actions and the statements attached thereto seem to be in dispute.   We are further not certain if the actual contents, as it appears in the document, is accurate or not.\n\tThe process clearly does create rights for various persons who at various times will have opposing interests.  However, in our view, the Act is couched in terms that suggest the spirit thereof is that of reconciliation, to discourage anger and favour rather the applicants than the rights of others.   This does not mean that we ignore the rights of others.\n\tIn this matter, we may mention that the actual grounds for opposition is not at all clear.   Indeed we have been informed on numerous occasions that the attempt was to test whether the applicant was making full disclosure, and at best about his political reasons for having committed the crimes.\n\tThe right to cross-examination has specifically been curtailed in the Act, and this is indicative of our view as regards the spirit of the Act.   It fortifies the tendency to lean in favour of the applicant.   While this is so, it is clear that the right to cross-examination must be protected, albeit in a restricted way.   \n\tFurthermore, if any dispute as to voluntariness or the truth of the contents of a document arises and which makes the use of such documents doubtful, there is no provision in the Act which allows one to embark on a mechanism to prove the truth of the contents or whether that statement or document had been made voluntarily.   The process was intended to be completed as quickly as possible, and not to be converted into a full-blown, long, dragged-out criminal trial.\n\tAs I understand it, Mr Hattingh, fairly I think, has changed slightly his position, and he's not seeking that the document be admitted, but rather that he could use it.  \n\tI do not plan to go into all the implications thereof.  However, our ruling is as follows:  that certain propositions which may or may not appear in the document can be put to the applicant.   His answers thereto will stand.  Should the answer tend to negate the truth of the proposition or dispute the voluntariness thereof, the aspect cannot be taken further in terms of the document.\n\tThat is our ruling.\n\tMr Hattingh, were we by you or ...(intervention).",

After I was shot at, I was arrested and my brother, Mphimelo Lokwaka, passed away.   When I was released from jail, I didn't have a house, the police took my house because they found petrol bombs and some of the things in the house.   Therefore, my house was destroyed.\n\tI want to tell the Chairperson that he must also try and make some means to compensate me, because I also suffered a loss and I got injured.  \n\tI would end there.   \n\tAnd the fact that I apologise to the victims and the people who lost their children because of my actions.
