I will then, with the leave of the Committee, call the current incumbent Mayor of Piet Retief, Mr Gamede, who is not an applicant, to provide the Committee with the background to what prevailed in Piet Retief.  We are acutely aware, both Mr Patel, myself and the leader of evidence of the TRC on a previous occasion had got together to try and limit the time and the extent of the evidence which is going to be presented relating to the background situation.  We had a brief meeting, well not a brief, we had a meeting this morning from half past eight with the other representatives.  Without speaking on their behalf, there appears to be some form of general consensus as to the political tensions and the background evidence which is going to be presented.  So, I'm aware that we don't certainly wish to waste the Committee's time of having lengthy evidence, but we feel that some evidence relating to background will be presented.

On the brief historical background document contained in the papers before you, I see there's no such copy before the witness and I wonder if such a copy can be placed before him.  I think also it's probably necessary for me to mention at this stage, which I ought to have mentioned earlier on, what I've picked up from the bundle of papers, which we all seem to have, is the form, the application form which forms part of the Bundle A running from sixty eight (68) to pages seventy four (74), whilst it relates to a Mkhwanazi, it is not the Mkhwanazi which is applicant number four.
