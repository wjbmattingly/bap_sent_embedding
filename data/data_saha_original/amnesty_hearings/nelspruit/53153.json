            "Thank you Madam Chair.  Madam Chair, this Honourable Commission yesterday heard the amnesty applications of the two applicants, Mr Leonard Radebe and Mr R.S. Sithomo.\n\tMadam Chair, if I might just start by referring to the application of Mr Sithomo.  I think there is nothing said surrounding the merits of this application, and I will commence with the application of Mr Radebe and the evidence led surrounding the application.\n\tMadam Chair, Mr Radebe applied for amnesty in his application, concerning an incident which occurred on the 28th of September 1992, near the Ratanda Hostel and for which he was convicted on the 2nd of November 1995, on a charge of murder and several charges of attempted murder.\n\tThe applicant then applied for amnesty and submitted his Form 1 application with supporting affidavits, and in this respect, submitted two affidavits.\n\tIf I may, Madam Chair, the first affidavit states applicant's involvement in the crime for which amnesty is sought, and also shows his involvement or his alleged involvement in this crime.  Madam Chair, as far as the second affidavit is concerned, it makes mention of several other incidents, but which were not specifically, for which amnesty was not specifically applied, but an amendment of the application was then asked for in respect of these crimes mentioned or participation in certain incidents, mentioned in this second application.\n\tMadam Chair, I would like to start by saying that as far as the applicant's viva voce evidence yesterday before this Commission is concerned, it should be and one would be naive not to agree that there was certain shortcomings in his evidence, it is indeed so that he gave certain very elaborate answers concerning some questions which was repeated to him.\n\tWhether this was a question of not clearly understanding of deliberating evading the answers, I presume is open for debate.  Madam Chair, getting back to the specific application, it is then so and the point was also specifically raised by the Commission yesterday that amnesty is applied in connection with an offence for which Mr Radebe the applicant, was convicted, and that was one specifically of murder, in which it was found that he was the perpetrator of the said crime.\n\tIt is then again also true that yesterday, following from his application and his affidavit annexed to the application, that Mr Radebe has indicated that his involvement is only limited to the planning of this particular crime.\n\tHe gives broad evidence surrounding the planning and his involvement which is according to him, limited to the planning and he also says that he saw the act committed, but he was not a person who actually committed these particular deeds.\n\tMadam Chair, it is true that this creates a problem in as far as that is the specific crime for which amnesty is sought.  Madam Chair, I would like and this is my humble submission to this Commission today, that even though the applicant had been convicted or murder and in the capacity as the person who actually committed this crime, if I may be given the opportunity Madam Chair, it is my line of reasoning that I followed up on the issue, and it is true that the Committee yesterday asked me that they would like to hear me on some specific points.\n\tMadam Chair, it is my submission that surrounding the specific crime, it is well known in the criminal law that there are the perpetrators, the accomplices and if I may just, the definition of a perpetrator is somebody who by his conduct, state of mind and personal quality falls within the definition of the crime.\n\tMadam Chair, it is my submission that it was indeed in this capacity which the accused was found guilty by the court, for which he is currently serving a jail term.  If I may also just refer to the ...",

            "That is one hundred percent correct Madam Chair.  My line of reasoning is this that it is indeed true that this evidence was heard and it was in a criminal court, he was found guilty of these offences.\n\tMadam Chair, if I might address that issue later, surrounding the merits of his testimony.  If I may just - I looked at the definition of murder, and it is stated that it is unlawful, intentional causing of another's death, and any person who, in whatever way, unlawfully, intentionally causes another person's death, is therefore a perpetrator of this murder, or the murderer, which is indeed the capacity in which he was convicted.\n\tMadam Chair, I would however like to take it a bit further and also look at the definition of an accomplice to such a murder.  It is also said that an accomplice is somebody who does not in terms of his conduct, state of mind and personal qualities, comply with the definition of the crime, but nevertheless unlawfully and intentionally furthers its commission by somebody else.\n\tI think this follows clearly that the perpetrator and the accomplice promote the commission of the crime, before it is completed.\n\tMadam Chair, if I might just also look at the different degrees of perpetrators.  There is a definite difference made in the criminal law between a principal perpetrator, a co-perpetrator and an indirect perpetrator.\n\tIt is my submission that once again, as stated and as it was conducted, he was in the context of the conviction, as stated by the witnesses, the perpetrator of this particular crime.  Madam Chair, it is my line of reasoning, if one looks at the well known principle of doctrine of common purpose, known in our criminal law, and if I may, it is stated in this doctrine although not impossible, it is improbable that somebody would participate in a murder merely as an accomplice and not as a perpetrator.  It is improbable that the furthering of death, would be regarded as anything other than causing it.\n\tIf two or more persons decide to murder someone, for all of them to be liable as co-perpetrators, it is not necessary that each of them should stab or fire a shot at the deceased.  It is not even necessary for them to touch the deceased, or be present at the scene of the crime.  This is especially relative, say a relatively large number of persons decide to murder a single victim, which was not the exact facts, but just - there was a meeting held according to the evidence, and it was decided at this particular meeting that a person or that the bus should be attacked.",

            "No, no, I realised I should have put it on record, thank you madam.  If I might just continue, there is a further reference made and it clearly states and it is said that if a number of persons conspire to murder now just for reference sake, Y, and one of them does not fire the mortal shot, is not even on the scene of the crime, and does not in any way, aid its commission after its conspiracy, it is a factual question whether in the circumstances, his mere participation in the conspiracy can be described as together with the participation of other, causing the person's death.\n\tIn view of the test of causation, the mere participation in a conspiracy, Madam Chair, and if I may here, I also went further and specifically had a look at the requirements for a conspiracy and if I may, once again, out of Snyman, page 244, the requirements for conspiracy is inter alia stated that the scope of a conspiracy is particularly wide.  Conspiracy in the South African law can be committed only if what the parties agree to do, is a crime.\n\tThere can be conspiracy only if there is a definite agreement between at least two persons to commit a crime.  The mere fact that X and Y both have the same intention, does not mean that therefore there is a conspiracy between them, they must subjectively agree with each other, there must be a meeting of minds.\n\tIf I may continue, it is also further stated that as soon as they have reached agreement, the crime of conspiracy is complete and it is unnecessary to prove the commission of any further acts in execution of the conspiracy.\n\tI think this is all taken together in saying that the conspirator need not be in direct communication with each other, if two or more persons unite in organisation with the agreed purpose of committing a crime or crimes, there is a conspiracy.\n\tIt then also follows that the conspirator is liable to the same punishment as a person convicted of committing the offence.\n\tMadam Chair, this said, I would like to get back to the doctrine of common purpose, where I left off.  In the view of the test of causation, his mere participation in conspiracy, either on its own or coupled with his further conduct, may account to at least psychological engagement of or assistance to his fellow conspirator, who actually kills a person and therefore, to causing together with the others, the death of such a person.\n\tMadam Chair, my line of reasoning would be if I may address the merits of Mr Radebe's evidence before this Commission, evidence was indeed led and also tested by amongst others, Mr Sithole for the families of the deceased, and it was very clearly stated that the incidents preceding the actual commission of this crime, I think it was clearly established that according to the applicant's evidence, there was a meeting held on this particular Sunday Madam Chair, following the death of an induna.\n\tThe applicant clearly states that this was a party meeting, which contained the ranks of IFP party members.  If I may, I think his evidence was specifically, he also gave the names of these members.  He said it was a party of eight, he could only remember the names of four, which included himself - this was after the death of Mr Mkababa, and Mr Meyela which was the Chairman of this particular party that was, this meeting that was held.\n\tMadam Chair, it is my line of reasoning that following the evidence given by the applicant concerning this particular meeting, it clearly states that the members who were present, were all IFP members.  It was done because of their distress over the death of a fellow IFP member.\n\tMadam Chair, he goes further to also say that there was a general meeting and later, Committee meeting followed this general meeting, in which it was expressly Committee members which attended and it was already on this ill-fated Sunday evening that the decision was taken, and it was also his evidence that the decision was already taken on the Sunday evening, that a bus should be attacked.\n\tUnder cross-examination by Mr Sithole, I believe he said that the decision was taken, but the operatives were not chosen the Sunday night, they would be chosen later by the indunas, even though the objective was clearly stated.\n\tMadam Chair, this said in context with my reference to the doctrine of common cause, it is my submission that and further if I may also, under examination the applicant also clearly stated that he fully reconciled himself with this decision.\n\tHe said that he did not commit it, but should he have been asked to do so, he would have.  He said it was not his place to choose to commit this act, but it was a choice that was to be left to the indunas.\n\tMadam Chair, he then decided that or it was then decided that this decision should be taken.  Madam Chair, if I might just continue on the evidence that was led, the accused said that when he went to work the following day, and it should also be admitted, there are certain points concerning his presence at work the next day which were not entirely cleared up, specifically surrounding when he went home from his place of employment.\n\tMadam Chair, it is stated by the accused that he was extremely distraught and upset because he was being pointed out by FAWU members who were also perceived to be ANC member, that he was going to be killed, and his honest belief was that his life was in danger.\n\tIt is his evidence that it was because of this, that he decided to leave the factory.  I think this is to some extent his, the fact that he indicated that he was very upset, corroborated by the witness, Mrs Msibi who said she saw the applicant crying that particular day.\n\tMadam Chair, I think it is fairly clear and it is not denied by any party, that he was indeed very upset when he went home.  Madam Chair, it is true that he says that he got back to the hostel to find this planning of the act or the operatives were appointed at that stage and the act was committed.\n\tHe further also states that he then went with them or was outside the gate of the hostel when this throwing of the hand grenades actually occurred.  It is also true that there are certain aspects which I believe, might not have been answered satisfactorily concerning what he actually saw and it differed slightly from his original version and the time when he was cross-examined.",

Madam Chair, I think looking at the circumstances surrounding or preceding this incident, it is clear that there had been struggles, there had been incidents as Mrs Msibi testified, after the strike when FAWU members returned, there was indeed incidents between FAWU and the union supported by the applicant, which was predominantly perceived to the IFP supported.\n\tIt was also the evidence of the applicant that he had several run ins prior to the incident, with members of FAWU.  Under questioning from the Committee, he stated that he feared his life at his work place, and thus he came to the conclusion that there was no other way.  It is also expressly stated in his evidence, it was decided at this meeting that steps should be taken to decrease the popularity of the ANC and increase the possibility for the IFP to broaden their political hold in this particular area.\n\tMadam Chair, it is my submission that as far as this particular motive is concerned, it is clearly established in that with reference to the two unions, UWUSA and FAWU involved, I think it was also to some extent corroborated by the applicant, although she said she was not a member of any political party, that UWUSA was perceived to be IFP and FAWU was predominantly perceived to be ANC orientated.",

            "Thank you Madam Chair.  Specifically in this regard, I think the inference can be drawn to the fact that there was no clear distinction between party politics, that being the fight between the ANC and the IFP, and the fight which extended perhaps to the work place between FAWU and UWUSA.  It was clearly a political quarrel.\n\tMadam Chair, in this regard, as far as the political objective is concerned, it is my submission that I think it has been satisfactorily indicated that there was a very express political motive behind this crime.\n\tMadam Chair, as far as full disclosure is concerned, it is so that in a court of law, the accused had been, the applicant, at that stage the accused, had been convicted of a crime, and in the capacity of not a conspirator, but the one who actually committed the crime.\n\tThis necessarily raises some questions, and I think the applicant answered to some of these questions in saying that what had happened that day, he had several reasons for it, in that he wanted to protect some people, but he also concluded by saying that the evidence given before this Committee in his application, is the actual truth.\n\tMadam Chair, based on those submissions, I am also of the opinion that the applicant did disclose his actual role, I think it goes further in his saying that had he been asked to do so, he would have.\n\tI think that might indicate that not the intention of a person who wants to hide anything from this Commission.  Madam Chair, if I may just as far as the proportionality is concerned, it is true that this was a very serious crime indeed, but I think it also follows from the evidence surrounding this particular meeting, that the accused said that according to his version, there was a not trying to exaggerate but the impression was created by him, that there was almost a running battle between the Ratanda hostel, the Ratanda residence and this also extended to his work place, between FAWU and UWUSA members.  \n\tHe said that he felt threatened on a daily basis, and on that particular Monday, he said that he felt his life was threatened, when he was pointed.  I stand to be corrected, I think he also said that it was said to him that he was going to be killed.\n\tMadam Chair, he said that it was decided that drastic measures should be taken and it was decided to bomb the bus and it was also clearly stated why this decision was taken.  He said that they wanted to increase the support of the IFP to the detriment of the ANC.\n\tMadam Chair, as far as the merits of this application is concerned, and the applicant's worthiness or the value of his testimony, it is true that it was often asked of him to clearly explain himself on some of the very elaborate answers he gave to I believe, fairly simple questions.\n\tMadam Chair, as I said, it would be naive to say that he was a very, he was an outstanding witness.  It is however my submission, and I think he was truthful and tried to answer the questions to the best of his ability.\n\tMadam Chair, in conclusion, it would be my humble submission before this Committee that taken into account, the value of his testimony, it is my submission that I think the applicant should be believed in the truthfulness of his application.\n\tAs such, should the merits warrant it, we are still as I explained or tried to convey with this doctrine of common purpose, the question remains that which the applicant in his viva voce evidence gave before this Commission and that which was actually applied for, is not in the same context.  It is my submission that this could be remedied if the inference is drawn that although not convicted as a conspirator or a co-perpetrator, the accused, once again the applicant, in his criminal case, might have received the same sentence.\n\tIn this regard, I would like the Committee to view it as such, that he clearly states his involvement and the fact that he reconciled himself with what was going to happen, that he was also a perpetrator of this crime, and as such fall under the ambit of the granting of amnesty.\n\tI therefore request this Honourable Commission to consider his application as such.",

Maybe just getting to the point that the accused once again, might have been seen by Ms Msibi to be part of this incident, whereas he was actually relatively removed from it all, but being a traumatic experience, this is a detail which stayed with her.",

The only outstanding aspect in my view is the question of full disclosure.\n\tIt is my submission that the applicant Mr Radebe, has failed to show to this Commission, that he has disclosed fully the incidents leading to the attack as well as his participation in the attack.\n\tThe victims as well as the evidence of Johanna Msibi, state clearly that he was one of the perpetrators and she also gives a background as to why he committed the said offence.\n\tWhen Mr Radebe is asked as to why he misled the trial court, there are three different answers that come forth.  He initially told this Committee that he doesn't know, he again said he was protecting himself as well as his colleagues, and in the affidavit that is before this Committee, he states further that he was told to admit the offence by his colleagues.\n\tThose are signs of failure to disclose as to the circumstances, the full circumstances relating to the commission of the offence.\n\tIf Mr Radebe came to this Committee and led this Committee as to the real reason why the offence was committed and that he committed the offence, there would be no reason why this Committee wouldn't give him amnesty.  It is a clear indication that yes, there was a fight between UWUSA and FAWU and there is a perception nationally that UWUSA is a union which always aligns itself with IFP and on the other side, FAWU aligns itself with the ANC.\n\tI would ask this Commission to dismiss his application only on the basis that he failed to disclose to this Committee, thank you.",

On the ensuing dispute which is whether the Committee should attach much weight to whether it makes a difference whether the applicant actually threw or did not throw the object as seen by Ms Msibi, my submission is that, or my argument is that the applicant disclosed the fact that he planned the whole act. \n\tHe further discloses the fact that he was present at the scene when the actual act was committed and I think this, how can I put it, it explains the other version of Ms Msibi having identified the applicant at the scene.  Yes, the argument would be that she saw him throwing something at the bus, but considering the fact that Ms Msibi has also admitted to the fact that there was for lack of a better word, enmity between FAWU and UWUSA at that stage, I mean it would explain really why she associated, it explains why she associated seeing the applicant at the scene, with actually the fact that he committed the offence.\n\tI think that is the explanation I would give, and that is my submission.  Further considering the fact that the bus was in motion, and considering the fact that we heard the applicant saying when the explosion took place, he fell on the ground or something, I mean that as well, you know would explain maybe why Ms Msibi might have seen the applicant bowing down on the ground.",
