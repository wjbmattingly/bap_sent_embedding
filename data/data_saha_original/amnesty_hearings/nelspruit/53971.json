            "Thank you Madam Chair, if I may proceed.\n\tMadam Chair, as we all know, one of the purposes of the Act is to grant amnesty to persons who make full disclosure of the relevant acts associated with political objectives, the said act should have been committed in the course of conflicts of the past. \tNow, the applicant in this matter, Mr Mondli Wiseman Ngxongo did comply with the requirements of the Act, to be more specific Act 34 of 1995 as amended in the following ways, and I wish to state it in the following order:  first of all his application was submitted timeously, that is within the cut off date as stated by the Act, further on Madam Chair, the applicant gave viva voce testimony regarding his political grooming and background.  This background is IFP indoctrination, in outlook and in essence.  The applicant maintained throughout his testimony that he was  an active IFP member as well as a member of the so-called hit-squad as they were known, under the leadership of the late Mr Mbuyani and the late Mr Mbambu.  It is against this background Madam Chair, that the applicant's application should be viewed.   \n\tFurther on the applicant testified and disclosed all the planning and the said planning was narrated step by step until the final assassination of the deceased, Mr Tiledi and others who might have been injured in this incident and specifically the cross-fire.  The applicant further made mention of the role played by his co-applicant, Mr Mbuso Romeo Mbambu.  It is also worth noting that the evidence of the applicant is on all material respects, the same.  I refer to the evidence of Mr Mbambu which is contained in pages 9 to 41 from the testimony read in conjunction with that of Mr Mbambu, Madam Chair, it is my submission that the killing of Mr Tiledi was indeed politically motivated.   The applicant further disclosed all the facts surrounding the killings of Mr Tiledi.  \n\tIn this respect I refer to the viva voce evidence of Mr Ngxongo, which left no stone unturned.  Madam Chair, the applicant further made mention of certain persons who was part of the plan, or at least were associated with this activity.  A lot of names were mentioned and amongst those names were that of Capt Hlengwa, Mrs Mbuyasi and the aforementioned persons who were all implicated during the course of these proceedings.  The plan was to thwart the ANC from smuggling AK47s across the border, these weapons were used to kill certain members of the IFP and this has been the testimony of the applicant herein.  It is further submitted Madam Chair, that there has been a full disclosure of what has happened there.   The persons implicated were subpoenaed to appear before the TRC, if they choose to ignore the TRC, they do so at their own peril  and at their own risk.  \tThe applicant needless to state, was in the company of his co-applicant Mr Mbambu who was also his co-accused in the criminal trial and the co-applicant in this matter, as I have stated. \tMadam Chair, in the criminal trail, the applicant in this matter, pleaded guilty and in these proceedings, he also left no stone unturned and we are made to believe that Mr Mbambu indeed was granted amnesty.  Madam Chair, I wish to conclude and it is my submission that the acts of Mr Ngxongo was indeed an act associated with a political objective and if I can quote Section 2 of Act 34 of 1995, (2) of Section 20, Madam Chair, I quote -\n\"... an act associated with a political objective means any act or omission which constitutes an offence or delict which according to the criteria in (3) is associated with a political objective and which was advised, planned, directed, commanded or committed within or outside the Republic, during the period 1 March 1960 to the cut off date\".\n\tMadam Chair, it is my submission that amnesty should be granted to the applicant, it is my submission that he came out with the truth and he asks for forgiveness and it is our humble request that amnesty be granted to my client.  Thank you.",
