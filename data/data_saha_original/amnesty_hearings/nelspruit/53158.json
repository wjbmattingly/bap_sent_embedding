The panel consists of the following members:  on my right-hand side, Advocate Francis Bosman, on my left-hand side, Mr Ilan Lax, and I'm Judge Sisi Khampepe, who is chairing this hearing.\n\tThis application for amnesty is connected with the application of Mr Romeo Mbambo, who has already appeared before this committee in respect of various incidents for which he applied for amnesty in the hearings that have become known as the Caprivi hearings. \tThe hearings in respect of the Caprivi hearings were held at various places across the length and the breadth of our country.   \n\tThe first hearing was held in Richards Bay, wherein incidents relating to that particular region were dealt with.   \n\tThe second hearing was in Pietermaritzburg, which dealt with the incidents affecting that particular area.   \t\n\tThe third hearing was in Ermelo, and the matter of Mr Japie Thalede was heard in Ermelo, but it was only in respect of the applicant, Mr Mbambo.   \n\tSo, in respect of Mr Mbambo's application for the killing of Mr Thalede, he has already given testimony.  In his testimony and in his application, he alleged that Mr Ngxongo was present when he shot Mr Thalede.   We are today to hear the evidence of Mr Ngxongo in support of his own application for amnesty for the killing of Mr Thalede.\n\tWill the legal representatives of the parties involved in this hearing kindly place their names on the record?",

In particular, I'm concerned about instructions, for example you'll be aware, having sat in the other issues, the issues of the indiscriminate killings, what the attitude was, and more general information about how these hit squads operated, because this witness is operating in a different area in relation to - and under different circumstances, so I would perceive that the evidence that he might have in that regard would be seen by the committee who considers the application in the other matter that I'm involved with, as being quite supportive and quite independent, as opposed to the evidence of the three who've basically been together all along, and that's basically my position, but I'm sure, in that regard, it's a very short aspect.   I don't know if you're intending to finish, I don't know, if we could finish tonight, but I don't see that we can, I believe that you were expecting to finish at 7:00, but there's still argument to come and there's also certain questions from my learned friend, Ms Thabete, so I don't know if we would, in any event, finish this evening.",

We are very loath at having to sit with a part-heard matter, because it is extremely difficult to reconvene the panel with a view of finalising matters such as these, particularly where we are dealing with applicants who are held in custody.

As you say, the version given by Mr Ngxongo during his viva voce evidence seems to support the version already given by Mr Mbambo, if I recall, in Ermelo.    We have been sitting and hearing these applications for the past year, and would really want to conclude these Caprivi hearings.   There is nothing new I would expect of you to obtain from any of your clients, particularly with regard to the general operation of the hit squad.
