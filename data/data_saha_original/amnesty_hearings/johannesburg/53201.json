This is going to be our first sitting at this venue, wherein we are going to hear and consider applications of people who are convicted and are applying for various offences, which they allege they committed whilst they were members of the Self Defence Unit.\n\tThe first application we are going to consider, is the application of Gladwell Selahle.  Before we commence, I want to introduce the panel that will be sitting this week.  On my right hand side, I have Adv Francis Bosman, on my left hand side, I have the Attorney of the Supreme Court, Mr Ilan Lax and my name is Sisi Khampepe, I am Chairing these proceedings.\n\tWe would like to convey our apologies to you for having kept you waiting for so long.  As you are aware, we always have teething problems when we start our hearings, particularly because we have to rely on various role players, being able to enable our proceedings to start timeously.\n\tWe up to now are still waiting for some of the applicants, that we were due to hear this morning, which still have to come from places like Boksburg and Leeukop prison.  They still haven't come.  We have now decided to proceed with the application of Mr Gladwell Selahle, to try and make up for the lost time that we have already suffered this morning.  \n\tWe would like to extend our appreciation to Mr Mohlaba who is representing the applicants who have yet to be brought here by Correctional Services, thank you very much Mr Mohlaba.",
