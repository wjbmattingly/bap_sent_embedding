            "Madam Chair yes.  Madam Chair, the position with the remaining amnesty applications which number approximately twenty, there is a difficulty.  That difficulty as Madam Chair is aware as well as the Committee, we've been trying to solve this morning was that in respect of all the victims in these amnesty applications notice or proper notice has not been given as is required in terms of Section 19.4 of our Act and although there was press release on the 18th November I understand in The Star, apart from that and I understand there was a broadcast on the Sesotho radio station, unfortunately I haven't been informed when that was.  I cannot give the Committee any assurance that victims have been properly notified.  My investigation of these matters in the main where the applicants have been convicted, there are court records available.  In fact some of the applicants mention victims by their names and some of them even give addresses.  I have no indication before me that this information was followed up upon, that it was investigated properly and that at least reasonable steps were taken to contact the victims.  I am in the unhappy position Madam Chair to inform the Committee that I have in the circumstances been instructed by head office Cape Town to ask that these amnesty applications be postponed sine die, that is until new dates can be arranged and that is in the New Year.  Thank you unless there is any other matter the Committee wish to hear me on?",

I think the applicants, the majority of whom had to appear for the next three weeks are applicants who are in prison and in terms of Section 18 they should be given a priority when it comes to the scheduling of applications.  One would have thought that much care and attention would have been taken to ensure that mistakes such as these do not happen.  We are not happy with the situation as a panel and we hope that these will be communicated to our administrative staff in Cape Town.  We cannot afford to run hearings in such a disjointed fashion.  Mr Mahlaba, you have heard Mr Prior's reasons for requesting that the matters be postponed sine die.  Do you have anything to say?",

            "Madam Chair, before Advocate Sekwana is asked to address the Committee may I also draw to the panel's attention that I received yesterday afternoon or during the course of the day rather a faxed letter from the Inkatha Freedom Party addressed by a Mr M.A. Msisi who in the letter requested a postponement due to the fact that amnesty applications in respect of SDU members were given to the IFP at a very late stage.  They also indicated that they would be in a position to assist tracing victims and that they needed more time to do that so there is an added dimension to the matters that it would be dangerous to proceed with matters where victims have not been - especially victims of another political group, have not been given adequate notice in respect of these applications.  May I have leave to possibly hand up the letter?",

You are carrying the matter of Mr Sishaba and from what Mr Prior has said there does not seem to have been any notices served on any of the victims in respect of all the applications set down for the next three weeks before this panel.

I therefore on behalf of Mr Sishaba request the Committee to make a recommendation on his behalf that the question of sentence be suspended until the application for amnesty is finalised by the Committee.",

We have taken into account the reasons that we have advanced even though we have expressed our unhappiness.  We hope that we will be confronted with such requests in the near future.  I would like to address the public and convey our sincere apologies for having kept you here the whole morning.  It was indeed for reasons beyond the Committee's control.  We hope that when the matter will be heard the next time there will be no cause for any delay in respect of the matters that would be heard by the Committee.  We hope you understand.  We would like to express our gratitude for having attended this hearing, thank you.\n\t The matter is postponed sine die and the Committee will adjourn to a date to be arranged.\nHEARING ADJOURNS",
