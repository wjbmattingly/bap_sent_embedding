<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we proceed with the next applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The next applicant Chairperson is Marius Etienne Visser.  His application appears on page 84 of the bundle which is placed before you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Do you have any objection to taking the Oath Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I will take a confirmation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Do you confirm that the evidence which you will deliver will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MARIUS ETIENNE VISSER:</span> (confirms)</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you Chairperson, may I proceed?  Very well, Mr Visser you along with the other applicants in this matter were arrested and prosecuted in the Supreme Court of the Witwatersrand on charges of murder and various other charges of which you were found guilty.  Is that correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And in the Supreme Court you were given the death penalty initially?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And is it correct that at a later stage your case was referred back to the courts by the Appeal Court where you were given a prison sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what was your sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You are applying for amnesty for the charges of murder and other charges of which you were found guilty as set out in the judgment of Justice Marais who found you guilty and sentenced you.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You have studied your application which appears on page 84 and goes on until page 100 and appears in the record.  Do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just another aspect Honourable Chairperson, that's on page 87 of the application, question 10.a should be amended to refer to:  See Annexure A, not B.  That would be on page 87.  I beg your pardon Chairperson I think I'm actually making an error.  Mr Visser in the family in which you grew up, was it conservative or liberal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was of a conservative nature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And which party did you support since 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Me myself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The Volksfront as well as all the right wing organisations such as the AWB and the SACP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What is your current age?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I am now 27.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you receive any military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> When did this occur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> 1992 at Voortrekkerhoogte.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at that stage, the ANC and SACP and other parties had already been unbanned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Before the unbanning of these parties in 1990 or the talk thereof, what were your sentiments and the sentiments of your family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In the climate of the circumstances we could surmise that things were becoming tense regarding the situation with the ANC and SACP members.  One could see that they were going to come into power and we regarded this as a very tense climate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you join the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct, in 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> For which reason did you join the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I believed in the ideology of the AWB and the objectives for which they stood, that would be for God the Volk and the Fatherland for an own language and a culture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> As time went by you've already testified that after the unbanning of the ANC a possibility existed that they would rule the country.  What was the sentiment and the viewpoint of the AWB with regard to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Their opinion was that they would never allow the ANC, SACP alliance and that class of organisation to simply take over the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At any stage during that period of time did you attend any meetings of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And those meetings which you attended, who were the chief speakers in leadership function?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Eugene Terreblanche as well as Constand Viljoen attended some of the meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And during those meetings, did you experience any influence over you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.  The meetings went hand in hand with sweeping up against the ANC and the SACP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you receive the impression that the leadership of the AWB would allow the ANC and SACP to take over the government and the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was there any talk of war within that climate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were any arrangements made for any violence which would be committed and that people should prepare themselves for this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.  People had to arm themselves as said by the leader of the AWB, Mr Eugene Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In which area did you reside in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Area 9.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And who was the commanding general of that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> General Japie Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The other applicants over here - Commandant Kloppers, who has testified shortly before you, did he occupy any position of authority in your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He was the Chief Commandant of Area 9.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Martin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He was the Commandant of Area 9.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you fall under his command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what rank did you occupy within the AWB at that stage in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At that stage I was an assistant Commandant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you therefore fall within the command of Mr Martin and then others below you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The other co-applicants, apart from those which I have mentioned, did they fall within your command or were they of equal rank, what were there positions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Van der Schyff occupied the same rank as I did and if I remember correctly, the other applicants occupied lower ranks that I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> On the 12th of December 1993 you were called to a Roadhouse in the Randfontein area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who called you in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Badenhorst, one of the applicants, came to fetch me at my girlfriend's house and told me that Commandant Martins' wife had issued an order that we meet at the Roadhouse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you go there in uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From there we went to Mr Badenhorst's house.  My uniform was at his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I had no arm, I didn't possess any arm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you went to the Roadhouse unarmed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at the Roadhouse, it has been testified that a meeting took place.  Were you addressed by Mr Kloppers at this Roadhouse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chief Commandant Kloppers arrived last of all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were any weapons handed out to anybody at the Roadhouse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Some of us didn't have weapons.  Myself, Gert Diedericks and Mr Van der Schyff didn't have weapons and upon that Mr Kloppers produced two pipe shotguns from his vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And who did he gives these to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The pipe shotguns were given to myself and Mr Diedericks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did Mr Diedericks and yourself keep the pipe shotguns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, it was taken from Mr Diedericks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> For what reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It wouldn't have come out but Mr Van der Schyff said that he would show Mr Diedericks how to shoot a kaffir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were any orders issued to you from anybody there at the Roadhouse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All of us were brought to attention when Mr Kloppers arrived and Commandant Martin saluted Chief Commandant Kloppers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were any orders given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chief Commandant Kloppers told us that he had just come from an order group meeting and that he had received orders there that we were going to execute the hard option that night and that they wanted to see corpses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was anything else said which you can recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, that this would be the real McCoy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Not as far as I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what did you understand by executing the hard option and that this was the real McCoy and that there had to be corpses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As I understood it hard options would mean that people would be killed or injured.  That's what I understood under the concept of hard option.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what did you understand when a homemade pipe shotgun was given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When I received the pipe shotgun I knew that people would be killed because two weeks before the time we were placed on assistance because of the revolution which was supposed to begin.  It was said to us that the revolution was about to begin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> When was it said to you that the revolution was about to begin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The night of the 12th of December, at the roadside, it was said to us that the revolution was at hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who said this to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Kloppers said this to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> After you had completed the parade, received the gun and received your orders did you go anywhere from there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If I remember correctly we arrived in four or five vehicles at the Roadhouse and after that we went to Mr Badenhorst's house because his parents were away on vacation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what happened at Mr Badenhorst's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There Chief Commandant Kloppers decided that only two vehicles would be used for the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And whose vehicles would it be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The Mercedes of Commandant Martins and the Sentra of Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were any changes brought to the vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.  The number plates were closed up with masking tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did that happen with both vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Visser's vehicle as well as Mr Martin's vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at Mr Badenhorst's house, did anyone consume any alcohol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Not that I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And from Mr Badenhorst's house, where did you go then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We then went to Andre Visser's apartment.  MR PRINSLOO:   He's also one of the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was any alcohol consumed at Mr Visser's home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Visser produced a bottle of whisky and each one of us took a sip of the whisky.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> How full was the bottle of whisky?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I would say it was about three quarters of the way full.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did Mr Diedericks use any alcohol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after the alcohol had been consumed, where did you go then, from Mr Visser's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From there we moved in the vehicles to Commandant Martin's small holding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was said to us that we would establish a roadblock and reflectors and a blue light were produced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after they were brought out, or let me put it this way, was any alcohol consumed at Mr Martin's house that you knew or saw of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As far as I recall I think there was brandy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you drink any brandy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And from Mr Martin's small holding, where did you go then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Martin, Chief Commandant Kloppers, Gert Diedericks and I travelled in the Mercedes and the others travelled in the Sentra and so we drove among the small holdings because we didn't know where to establish the roadblock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did anything happen while you were traveling which you saw yourself, not what you heard about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.  Two Black men were moving along the side of the road, the Sentra stopped and the occupants climbed out and assaulted those two Black men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did the other vehicle join up with you again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And where did you go then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From there we went to the Ridora Crossing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And when you say Ridora Crossing, in which area would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That would be on the Ventersdorp, Krugersdorp road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what happened there.  Did you stop, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> With our arrival there Mr Kallie Meiring was instructed to point out our positions to us, who had to stand where, who had to do what, who had to position the blue light and so forth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Meiring is also an applicant in this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Is that with regard to the establishment of a road block?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Kallie Meiring was instructed because he had previous knowledge of roadblocks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was a roadblock set up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And which function would you perform at this roadblock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Me and Mr Badenhorst would stand behind the chevron board for observation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> While you took up your positions and the roadblock was set up, did any vehicles approach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chief Commandant Kloppers and Commandant Deon Martins told us what the routine would be, that they would drive along, that they would seek out a target, that they would turn around and drive back and flash their headlights at us, that we had to drive along then and pull the vehicle off the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was any use made of the blue light or any light whatsoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct, the blue light was mounted on the Sentra.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you know who manned it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Andre Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were any vehicles pulled off the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And regarding those vehicles that were pulled off the road, was anything done to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The vehicles were searched and questions were put and I assume that the occupants were asked to which political parties they belonged, where they were going, what they were doing and so forth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you participate in the inspection or the searching of the vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As I've mentioned, I stood behind the chevron board looking out for police or military vehicles which might be approaching.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you perform any other function there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That was my function.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> ... (indistinct) according to the evidence a Honda Ballade and a Toyota vehicle were pulled off the road.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was a Toyota Cressida and a Honda Ballade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chief Commandant Kloppers and Commandant Martins drove along, identified a target, flashed their headlights and gave us the signal to pull the vehicles off the road.  At that stage we didn't know that it was a Honda and a Cressida.  At approximately 250 metres before the roadblock the vehicles stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chief Commandant Kloppers warned us to be careful because people could climb out the vehicles or remove things.  And the vehicle moved closer to us and the men who was the traffic cops when the vehicles were completely off the road told them to get out of the vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Is this now the Cressida and the Honda Ballade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Can you remember which vehicle was in front and which vehicle was at the back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Afterwards the people were told to sit on a hill next to the road and the people who acted as the traffic cops went ahead, it was Matthews, Van der Schyff and I think Mr Diedericks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at that stage you were still behind the chevron board?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after the search was complete, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The people who sat on the embankment were approached by Commandant Kloppers and Martins.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you know what the interrogation was about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I knew yes.  Questions were put to them for example where they come from, where they're going, what political party they belong to etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And do you know what the answers were to those questions?  In general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I assumed they were ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why did you assume that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Because the question was put to them, what political party they belonged to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chief Commandant Kloppers moved behind the people and those who did not answer he just tapped them on the head and Mr Martin moved in front of the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Continue please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Afterwards Commandant Martin called us from behind the chevron board.  I do not know who was in the group, but that's where the group was formed and it was said to us then that this is the target, SACP and ANC people and this is the target that we must shoot at and that we must shoot on the first shot of Commandant Martins.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What did you do, did you form a line?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After we received the instruction from Chief Commandant Kloppers I walked and found Mr Van der Schyff at one of the vehicle's boots where I said to him that he must get his gun ready, we're going to shoot these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What did he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm referring to the pipe shotgun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes and then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We moved in front of the first vehicle and the first shot was fired and everybody started shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> If you say we, does this include Mr Van der Schyff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who formed this line and fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I assume it was everybody who was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were shots fired towards these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you yourself shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With the pipe shotgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> How many shots did you fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is shot one shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you shoot in the direction of the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you realise at that stage that if you shoot at those people that you could kill them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes I realise it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after the shooting stopped, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After the shooting stopped people jumped into the Sentra and drove away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Are you now talking about the group of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And the car hadn't even reached full sped then Commandant Kloppers said we will meet them at the Town Hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you remain behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who else remained behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was me, Kloppers, Martins and Gert Diedericks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You've already given evidence that Mr Diedericks didn't have a weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What happened then when you stayed behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At the scene I picked up some of the shells and Mr Martin and Chief Commandant Kloppers were busy with the people who were lying on the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you know something about an ear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I heard in the vehicle that they cut the ear off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you did not see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you then go with Martins, Kloppers and</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>Diedericks to the Town Hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, we got into the vehicle and from there we went back to Mr Martin's small holding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Originally did you go directly to the small holding or did you drive somewhere else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No we went directly to the small holding in order to drop Mr Diedericks off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We had a drink at his house and from there we went to the Town Hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And when you got to the Town Hall, what was the purpose of the Town Hall meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That was the point where we all had to come together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were there other people there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson when we got to the Town Hall there was no one there and from the Town Hall we went to Mr Badenhorst's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you find the other people at Mr Badenhorst's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In short what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There it was put to us how many shots each</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>person fired and there everybody admitted that everyone fired a shot.  I don't know if the people were scared when they said that they fired ... (inaudible - end of tape)</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you see the ear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Visser did you take part in this action on your own or on behalf of someone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I did it on behalf of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you receive any remuneration for this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No nothing, not for myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you shoot at these people because of malice?  On the 16th of December of that same year, did you attend the "Verlofdedag" Festivities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you in uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was the 16th of December, Covenant Day, we were asked by Commandant Kloppers to attend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what happened at the festivities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We were asked by General Oelofse to form a guard of honour for Mr Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did Mr Terreblanche address you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after you formed this guard of honour did you leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you arrested by the South African Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then were you detained according to Section 29 of Internal Affairs.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did you make a statement to the police officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did you do it of your own free will or what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I would not say of free will Mr Chairperson because it was put to us and our co-accused what would happen to us if we didn't make a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was there something showed to you, what was showed to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Kloppers was shown to me when he was tortured.  I could see it because he did not look normal.  His face was swollen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And afterwards you appeared in court, pleaded</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>not guilty.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, some of the things were not the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To protect myself and higher ranks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Apart from murder you were also found guilty of the possession of illegal weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
