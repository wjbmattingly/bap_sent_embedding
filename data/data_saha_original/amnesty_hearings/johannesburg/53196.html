<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Moloi, what language would you prefer to use?</p>

<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MAKANJEE:</span> Mr Chairman, at the outset, I notice that on my client's application, at 9(a)(i) he mentions murder, attempted arson and damage to property.  After taking instructions, it appears that it is in fact murder, arson and damage to property and it is not attempted arson.  I just wish to clarify that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	After leading my client, his explanation would become quite clear on that aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>	Mr Moloi, are you a member of the ANC?</p>

<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKANJEE:</span> I notice in your application you state it was from 1993 to 1994.  Could you be more specific as to when this incident occurred?</p>

<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKANJEE:</span> What did you do after you killed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOI:</span> We went to check these shacks that belonged to the IFP members, and those who were attacked, came during the night, who are not there, we set their shacks alight.  We destroyed everything that belonged to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>	We set the shacks alight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOI:</span> Three shacks were set alight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKANJEE:</span> Did you do anything else to the body of the person that you had killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOI:</span> Nothing was done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Did you leave him inside his shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOI:</span> Yes, we left him in the premises.  He was a tenant there, that was not his home, that was not his own place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And you burnt his shack, so the body was burnt in that burning of the shack, even this man's body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOI:</span> No, he was outside the shack.  We took him out of the shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So his body wasn't burnt at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOI:</span> No, his body wasn't burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKANJEE:</span> The shacks that you burnt, were badly damaged, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOI:</span> Yes, it was badly damaged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKANJEE:</span> The petrol to burn the shacks, where did you get that from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it relevant Mr Makanjee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKANJEE:</span> I just thought the Committee ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKANJEE:</span> I've got no further questions for this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAKANJEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> I've got no questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> No questions Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Just to help me understand your evidence properly, essentially what you are saying is the reason you went out as a group, eight and then 16, was to go and attack the people who had been attacking you and in doing so, protect your community, is this really what you are saying?  This is the reason you went out that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOI:</span> To protect the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And you did this in circumstances where the community had very recently been attacked as well by members of...</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOI:</span> Yes, immediately after they have attacked the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you, thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are excused.  Or before you go, before you go, when did you join the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOI:</span> In 1993, early 1993 before the violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And one other issue, 16 of you and eight of you, did you go look for these IFP members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOI:</span> We knew where they were staying, the members of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You went out to go and get them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOI:</span> We only got one, the one we killed.  The others they ran away after they had attacked at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKANJEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I do have one other matter which is a hearable matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>	The Prison Authorities did not bring the applicant to court today.  I have informed them that he is in the awaiting trial section on another matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When are they promising to bring him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKANJEE:</span> I spoke to my colleague as well, and we were under the impression that he would be brought today, but I assume that if he hasn't been brought by now, they won't be bringing him today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There is no chance, those guys stop work at two o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I beg your pardon Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, my suggestion to my colleague was if he is not here today, he will probably be enrolled probably for the next hearing.  Whatever the position is, however Mr Chairman, Ms Nhlayisi is ready with her next client, if you would allow that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Microphone not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, they have numerous problems with Correctional Services.  I am in the process trying to sort it out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Keep us updated on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> I will do so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many have we got left, how many applications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, for the day, basically two.  It is Ms Nhlayisi and a client of Mr Sanje Makanjee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then we are done with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, then only the question of Mr Selepe which was standing down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>	It will probably be heard, I would suggest with all due respect Mr Chairman, it will probably be dealt with by tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> I will see if I can sort that out in the meantime as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So we've got two that will probably be handled tomorrow, both from the prisons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Yes, that is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, let us get done with Ms Nhlayisi's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Yes, that is correct, and then the question, it is the one applicant of Mr Sibeko, which will probably not be, he will probably not be attending today, so I am just waiting for the final word from Mr Sibeko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>	There is a probability that the application will also be withdrawn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>	Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
