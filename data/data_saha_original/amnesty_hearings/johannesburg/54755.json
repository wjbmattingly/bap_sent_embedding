I was not affected by that immediately but as one of the people who were at high school, we took that as an offence because we regarded that there was no age limit in education, and why was this being fostered to us as students of the other race.  And immediately thereof I, with my fellow students, challenged the government. We boycotted classes, we went on rampage, helping workers with their consumer boycott and all other means that would help us register our protest against what was being fostered upon us.\n\tDuring those years it became evident to me that all along I was not aware of the system that had given me the inferior education, and it is then that I realised that there are people like Comrade Mandela and others, who have been jailed for speaking out against oppression that is being enforced on us.

They would, upon having not had maybe, for instance, university entrance marks, they would end up having no jobs.  They would resort back to forming gangsters that would rob our parents, who by then would have woken up at four am to go and work for whatever peanuts that is being offered in those firms where they worked hard and toiled, but upon the coming day of salary, you would find our frustrated brothers - some who are literate and some who are illiterate - but who could not face the reason why they have been deprived of all the luxuries that our fellow South Africans of other colours were enjoying, would take their anger on our very fragile parents and take their little monies and our families would suffer as a result of that.  Our sisters would not move around the location after the sun has set, because there was this element of our fellow\nbrothers having turned themselves into bandits.  They would take them, rob them, rape them and do whatever they felt, what could suit their anger or would quench it for that matter.  And those duties we had to take responsibility as youth to make it a point that this does not happen, and that the whole people who have been diverted from the national goal, that is to seek freedom and enjoy whatever South Africa has to offer, equally.",

As student congress we used to go out and disarm our fellow brothers of weapons of that, weapons that killed our nation and we took those weapons, and handed them over to the police.  But in return the police were not to be trusted.  They took those very same weapons and gave it to gang members.  So as to fight comrades.  So this was the reason why the police could no longer be trusted and their effectiveness thereof was not\nfelt by us as a community.  \n\tAnd I should further state that upon realising this, there was a call that was made through the underground movement, the publications of Sichaba that police who were residing in our areas, because really, there was no one who was in the middle during the struggle. It is either you were with us or you were with the enemy.  So police had already chosen their side.  By the mere virtue of being a police and being on the other side of race, we would take you as a traitor and a collaborator.  And when the era came that we should read of policeman who were residing with us, stooges, informers and all that, it is then that we realised that the error that we made, we have armed people that could use these weapons effectively or worse, in maiming us, people who are trying to create an environment that is free for the launching of freedom of our people.",

I would make it a point that I am number 1.  So in a way it did affect me. I started disliking some subjects, for instance Afrikaans, as it was branded then, that it was the language of the oppressor and in education you really had to pass three of these languages, and it was difficult for me to deal with that as such.\n\tIn life generally, at home there was no longer peace between myself and my family.  My place was frequented by security police and the soldiers and they would come, assault my mom and I had to leave my home. I had to stay in scrap cars to sleep there and go home only to fetch lunch or to sneak in and have a bath and then go to school.  At school as well, I had to hide when I had to come out of school, because the area as there was turmoil at the time you would that it is frequented by police.  And I guess I didn't have much of sleep, because any car that passed by or gave sound of, the one I know - Casspirs, Hippos or (indistinct) that were used by the SAP would eventually give the call that I should wake up and start running. \n\tWhat is worst of all, I had to resort to violence as there were no other means of sjambokking people who had been convicted or found guilty in a people's court.  And to some aspects some hated me but it was okay to have enemies for doing the right thing.\n\tAs of showing people that I did have feelings, I had to hide them. I didn't have to have feelings.

            "Yes, M'Lord.  And upon that, Mr Masupa, that\nis Hendrik, answered arrogantly and started telling us that he knew all about our moves, places we sleep in and he knew how to deal with us and he was going to inform Sfuti and we must know now that they know of us, we won't be a neck or we won't bother them anymore with our searches that we used to do.  And we usually on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, there was this routine that we normally undergone to search shebeens and rid of weapons of that that were carried by our fellow citizens.  So that whatever happens after that they could not kill one another.  So he started boasting that we won't be able to bother them anymore about that, because we were going in.  \n\tThat infuriated us and we felt that something must be done and it had to be done drastically. Because in one of the days, a week before or so, we were standing in the very - it is a bigger complex, we were standing on the other end, and the very same man we had just passed on the doorway, he came and described me with the tooth that I am having here.  I had a knock and it changed or tainted the colour of my teeth, and he said he knew now that that, he used my name that was not known to people outside the ranks, that is Barrah-Barrah, because they often said I don't laugh.  So they used that very name and described that the one with the pinkish tooth and immediately I saw that he was accosting me and I ran off.  Upon us researching and trying to gather information as to how did it come about with this description and the name, we were told that before he came to this other end, he had stopped on that other end to speak to Mr Masupa.  As he boasted about this now, the whole thing came into a pattern.  We now realised that what we were dealing with was someone who had gone out of the way to \ninform about us and our activities.\n\tWe then decided to fight him but fighting him physically was not good anyway, because there were many, as you would be aware, there are two - it's a two-storey place, on the top is a shebeen and beneath it is a cafe where food and other materials is being sold.  So there are many people there and workers who were there. So they started coming in, all of them on top of us.   Upon that scuffle two Casspirs accosted that area and we ran off.\n\tWhen we ran off we decided that it was time that we talked and read a public lesson, that first, he cannot live with us and yet work for the other side. It is then that we decided to go and purchase fuel and we came back with that fuel.  As it was the culture then, we decided to go and burn down where he laid his head, meaning his home.   \n\tWhen we reached that place we knocked and we were asked who are you, and we responded \"comrades\".  The door was opened and we then informed them of our intentions.  Angry as we were, whilst I was informing them of our intentions, petrol was poured to the floor and I asked my comrade to wait so that we could evacuate people inside.  But in that confusion a stick of match was lit. I extinguished it and I tried to plead with the people to go out, but seemingly their attitude had been that having known us, as we are from the very same area, they thought either we are bluffing or as they usually referred to us, because we were many of us who had been comrades, for that matter, had been referred to as \"(...indistinct)\", because either at home we wouldn't have, we didn't have enough money to be dressed neatly like our counterparts, or they were so fortunate to have a cafe \nand a shebeen on top, so they could afford.  \n\tSo we were demeaned in words and we felt that this could not go on any longer.  As I was talking, my comrades were angry, I was angry myself but what we wanted to do was to burn down the house, so as to indicate that anyone who should not even dare think of selling us out to the security. \n\tThe second stick was lit. I managed as well to extinguish that stick, and I tried to talk to the people.  The stove was on, as I remember very well, it was hot.  It was red, in fact, on top, and I even thought that the way this had created a smell of petrol in the house, it was going to explode. So I pleaded with people to hurry up and get out.  But it couldn't happen.  \n\tFinally, I couldn't catch the other stick.  It came in front of me and it touched the fuel.  We were all inside the house and the house was in flames.  \n\tThe door was closed and the door lock had broken.  It was not in proper shape, that one could just pull it once and open.  So we fought with the door as the house was in fire.  I was in flames.  Apparently when the fuel was poured, the comrade was pouring petrol on the floor.  He had initially poured petrol in my legs.  I was wearing a cotton sock.  So it absorbed a lot of petrol.  I was in flames as well.  \n\tUltimately I managed to put my finger in and pressed it against the door, the door lock, because it had two holes, but it had broken in-between, so I managed to push it in and open whilst I was in flame.  The door was opened.  We all moved out.  \n\tThat is the last time I left the scene.  We ran out,\nprobably a sound of windows breaking down, I could hear it whilst we were walking away and people screaming.",

So that was the explanation that I got.  But however, upon pursuing this the then Minister of Justice, Minister Kobie Coetzee, said he was going to look to the matter and see what could be done, because some where released and some were not, and when I enquired, the last I heard of it is that the Minister had forwarded the recommendations that I be released to the office of the State President.  And ever since I was made aware that the opposition party in government wouldn't allow that I be released alone, and that a deal need to be struck politically that this should go across the political spectrum. If I be released alone as a member of the ANC, it would be taken as - it would offend other parties, so to\nspeak.  So the process need to be revisited and ultimately I was informed that I need to look at this from the angle that the TRC, the Truth and Reconciliation Committee was being installed and ultimately I will be afforded an opportunity to come and present my case and the decision would lie entirely upon the Commission.",

            "Mr Chairman, I think it would be helpful just for me to give a - just a very brief explanation because I do know what happened in his particular case.  His name was left off as a result of an administrative error.  There was at the time a lot of backwards and forwarding and running and trying to organise this list of names of people that were to be submitted.  His is not the only name that was left off.  There are other cases where groups of people were found guilty and three or four or five or six of a larger group's names appeared whereas others did not appear.  When you read through this record you will see that his involvement was no more or no less than the others.  There is no reason in regard to the actual crime that would justify his name being left off. It was purely an administrative error.  My enquiries a couple of years ago, indicated that that was in fact the case.  The reason why, and I don't, I can't tell you why President Mandela did not approve the - what was in President Mandela's mind as to why he did not approve the recommendation, but the information that I got from other sources and my understanding of discussions that I had with other political players, was that throughout that period there were deals that were being struck; if we release a person from the left then we must release a person from the right, and what's good for the goose is good for the gander.  And that negotiation was going on right through the early nineties and at some stage there was a decision that they would stop releasing people on political deals and hand it over to the Truth Commission and at the end of the day let the Truth Commission decide.\n\tAnother one, for example, which was similar was the case of Brian Mitchell.  In my capacity as chairperson of that advisory committee, we also recommended that Brian Mitchell be released.  And it was - because there was this general decision once it was known that there was going to be an amnesty committee as part of the Truth Commission, they decided to leave it up to the Amnesty Committee to deal with the matters as and when they came before the Committee. So one can say that they really transferred the responsibility of dealing with these matters to yourselves.",

I hope in your heart of hearts you will find a way, even if you don't forgive me now, but reconcile with me.  These wounds I am carrying inside may not heal, I know it is easy to say. You have scars, you have suffered, you have suffered more than I have ever imagine a person can suffer.  Life is irreplaceable. If there was anything I would do to bring back all your loved ones, I would believe it, even if it meant I should put my life at stake, I would do it.  I am sorry it ever happened, I can't sleep ever since.  There is something in my conscience that says but the cause was just, but in the process people lost their lives.  I cannot walk up tall with a head, with my head high.  Whatever achievements I have, there is still something hanging in my \nback.
