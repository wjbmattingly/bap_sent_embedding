We've been handed a document, a document containing notes made by Mr Bellingan.  We've been told that this note will be used during the re-examination of Mr Bellingan.  At this stage we do not want to merely object against the note, we just would like to place two concerns on record.  The first concern is, and I must immediately point out that I haven't been able to read through the document, I could, well some portions of it I could read, others I just couldn't make out what is stated here so I don't really know what exactly is stated in some of these paragraphs.  But the two concerns that we have are the following:  The first one is, from a reading of the bits that I can make out there seems to be contained legal argument.  If, and I think I would just like to emphasise this and ask my learned friend to take it into account, that he should stay away from legal argument as far as possible.  I just think if we spends, if Mr Bellingan especially, spends too much time on legal argument, whether it's legal argument or whether it's argument on how, on the record, on the evidence as to what evidence should be accepted or how evidence should be interpreted, that that's a matter for argument and that we shouldn't waste time on that.  I just would place that concern on record and that everyone should be alive to that issue.\n\tThe second concern that we have is that we all know that there's always a temptation for lawyers in re-examination to lead a witness, to put leading questions to a witness.  Insofar as the contents of this document may actually be another form of putting a leading question to Mr Bellingan, that he actually reads what is suggested in his own note, that should also be taken into account.  I would also ask my learned friend to be careful as far as that is concerned.  It is a bit unusual to put a document like this before a witness, we're not going to object against it in its entirety, but we would like you to take these considerations into account.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.",

Throughout the lengthy investigation, throughout the inquest, throughout the trial, throughout these proceedings for that matter, there's absolutely no evidence of a lavish lifestyle because I never led a lavish lifestyle, Mr Chairman.  In fact in my wife's own letter to her attorney, on page, I think it's 101 or 109, she refers, in Mr Trengove's bundle, she refers to or complains about the fact that this for a man who's never got any money to spend on things.  So there was no lavish lifestyle, Mr Chairman, and the cheques and the stubs that I got people are quite welcome to go through.  The building alterations etc., that I made are based on taking further bonds etc., etc.  I've got all the documents over here.  And I presume we're going to give the Committee ...(intervention)",

The tender papers are dated the 8th of September 1989, there is a letter from the Natal Provincial Administration to my father, and we had to put down a 10% deposit with the tender I see, which was paid back to my dad, because he put, he drew the R14 000 from his building society, attached the cheque and then we submitted that with the tender.

And also, Mr Chairman, the fact that obviously I rented out the cottage on the property as well.  So I received money from that as well.  My disposable income wasn't just the R1 700-odd, that pay slip which I handed in or showed Advocate Trengrove at that time, it was quite a lot more than that.\n\tAnd then I also had friends in the business and in return for me doing certain assessments, personnel and certain of their management things for them, I also got back things like, for example I see my plans were drawn up for these alterations by someone that I did some work for on the side, a Mr Core(?).

It hasn't really happened.\"\n\t\t\"Ja\"\nHe says.\n\"I mean he's - I'll see if I can contact him today and see what he's doing uhm, but I think ...\"\nThen he goes on like that.  Then on page 8, Mr Chairman, at counter 106, sort of three quarters of the way down the page, I say:\n\"But I mean, by the time I've sat with Kobus and yourself and fleshed out the whole thing, I may have mentioned 200 names and that's all background to the murder.  So they will all need due notice.  It's getting more and more complicated.\"\nJan says:\n\"Ja, and knowing that ...\"\netc., etc., etc.  In other words, he's in agreement.   Then on page 11, Mr Chairman, at counter 141, I say:\n\"Because I received a notification a long time ago, last year, for that skeleton that I submitted.\"\nJan says:\n\"Ja, ja\"\nI say:\n\"Uhm, so obviously it's right that they've accepted it as such, because other people here have received letters back saying you've neglected to answer this question or that question or whatever.

He only offered me assistance in getting that done.

            "All I was indicating, Mr Chairman, is that just to make it easier for everyone, there are references to the record that I found last night, on this particular question I was asked now about Annexure I, what was my intention.  And so in the record it's been explained ad nauseam by me, but just to put it concisely what my intention was with this discussion document.\n\tBasically the concerns that I've mentioned for safety of myself and my family, apropos the involvement of people who had quite obviously covered up matters, people unknown to me, apropos a perception of people in the intelligence community as to the fact that I was talking to the TRC, knowing full well that they didn't want me to be doing that.  \n\tAnd having regard to the fact that I was in a prison cell and completely in the dark as to what was going on, the fact that I needed to get information, the fact that I needed to give information in order to keep my credibility as it were, with the TRC Investigating Team at the time.  I mean I couldn't just tell a lot of nonsense to them, they wouldn't have come back and seen me, they would have just left it at that.  The fact that I had in mind a strategy of allowing my ex-colleagues to say well, Mike is okay, let's not worry about him, he's not really implicating us in anything which is a gross human rights violation.  \n\tThe matters that I did implicate named people in are things which I was under the impression then would have been sorted out a long time ago in chambers, small little things which would have certainly made my life a lot easier if had it been agreed to, if my ex-colleagues had have remembered those incidents and had have been advised maybe, or decided to apply for amnesty for them it would have made my life a lot easier, but to be faced with an amnesty application cold, whereas I say to Mr Kjellberg in that meeting in March of '97, there's so many names that I could potentially mentioned as a sort of background to the murder of Janine, in the sense of creating the background and so on.   \n\tWhy go through all of that, Mr Chairman, why go the hassle of an amnesty application which I had in mind was still to come, in other words consultation with an attorney and Mr Kjellberg for that matter, why go through the hassle if everyone is going to say I'm talking rubbish anyway if people aren't going to admit to the fact that these euphemisms were used, that the Security Branch had a particular organisational culture if the TRC then, if the Investigators were of the opinion that no such thing ever happened.\n\tAnd one can see also from this transcript that Mr Kjellberg agrees with me that when he arrived in South Africa he thought all these things he was hearing in the media are just too far fetched to be true, but by March of '97 already he agrees with me that he's quite convinced that there were these general types of instructions etc., etc.  So I was starting to get the kind of feedback that I felt more comfortable with from the TRC, in terms of the fact that they were getting the picture.  Then why go through all that hassle when very possibly I could have brought a review, Mr Chairman, for the matter.  I didn't have a fair trial, how can one have a fair trial in those circumstances?  It's not to say that I wasn't guilty, the two things are mutually exclusive in a sense of the Bill of Rights.\n\tSo if there was going to be information coming back, which I could have used also in that sense, if I decided no, it seems unlikely that I should go through the hassle and put everyone through the trauma of an amnesty application, then why don't I just continue with putting together a application for a review of the case, Mr Chairman.  So those are the issues that were in my mind at the time that I prepared these documents.  \n\tIt's not a question that Mr Kjellberg or anyone from the TRC brought me an application form, the application forms were freely available in the prisons.  For better or for worse bits and pieces of application forms were there.  So the fact that this happens to be sort of numbered according to a schedule or whatever has got nothing to do with the fact that it was, the status of this document was a discussion document and was not intended to be an annexure to my amnesty application.  And those are my reasons as to why I embarked upon this particular course of action then, in 1996, Mr Chairman.\n\tI can mention that nothing came of this document, also quite clearly from the transcript.  Other than - I did get a little bit of information, it seemed to have some effect, but the document itself, nothing came of it and basically it was dead and buried until it became an issue in February.",

            "It's the one of Mr Oosthuizen, Mr Chairman, marked Annexure K.  Mr Oosthuizen deals in paragraph 3.1 on page 2, with the question as to whether Janine worked for the Security Branch.  There's two comments that I can make about that, and the first on is that there was a long period when I was at Stratcom, when Mr Oosthuizen wasn't working with me, he was still in Johannesburg and I worked with Brigadier McIntyre etc., etc., and then certainly Janine worked for us on the basis that I've explained to the Committee, on the contract basis.\n\tWhen Janine initially started to work, as I've explained on peripheral basis for the Security Branch in Johannesburg, after I had met her, it could well be that Mr Oosthuizen doesn't remember that or that it may not specifically have been brought to his attention, as he says here.  \n\tAnd then I can just add there, Mr Chairman, that I've recalled that I gave a discussion in February about how one goes about the financing of these types of things.  \n\tAnd with respect to my media operation, my staff at the time will be able to confirm that for the media operation opposite Khotso House, I had a monthly standing advance for that operation and the stringers and the people associated with it that were paid would be paid and then the money basically claimed back by a claim form, not always via the usual system of motivations etc., etc.  \n\tSo I had fairly much a free hand as far as that is concerned, Mr Chairman.  It may well be that Janine was paid out of that system.  People on my staff at the time like Warrant Officer Beyers and Paul Erasmus and so on will be able to confirm that.\n\tAs far as paragraph 3.2 is concerned, it could well be that Mr Oosthuizen is right when he says:\n\"Ek dra geen kennis van die beweerde lys nie, of enige operasies wat in daardie verband geloots was deur teenspionasie nie.\"\nIt was in fact something I was doing, not counter-espionage, Mr Chairman.  The Committee must also remember that it wasn't only Mr Oosthuizen that I was speaking to, I had a fairly free hand in respect of my duties, Mr Chairman.  And I also had and was involved with some of the most highly skilled people in the country with these types of things.  So there were times when it just frankly wouldn't have been necessary to talk to Mr Oosthuizen about this type of thing.  \n\tIn fact, this past Sunday when I was going through some documentation I'd just received I found some document which prompted my memory as far as something else that Mr Oosthuizen also wouldn't have knowledge of, and that is how names that I arranged via head office and the regions of people that we were to test on mass, under the guise of what is called here scientific investigation, whereas in actual fact I was posing 140 ideological and personality questions to these people.\n\tIf one looks at these names over here there is only one conclusion that one could reach, some of the names that we slipped in, if one just looks at - well I'm sure that if the TRC looked at them they would agree with me that these are names that have been cropping up quite regularly in terms of what I would then have called possible extremists.  And there were also people on this list who were suspected of being working for the ANC at the time as well.  So Mr Oosthuizen would know nothing about this, but certainly some other people would.  And it's against the background of me drawing up a list and getting involved with these types of things that I mention this as well.\n\tSo as for paragraph 3.2, it could well be that Mr Oosthuizen doesn't know about that.  In fact I'm quite sure he didn't know about the list.  I already testified to the fact that I didn't want anyone to know about the list.\n\tIn terms of paragraph 3.3, I don't know if this is some sort of effort to get around this allegation that was made about Renata and I having an affair or being at Port Edward or whatever, prior to Janine's death, which is not, there's no basis at all for that, certainly not rumours around the office.  And I would have known if there were such rumours, Mr Chairman, I never heard any such rumours around the office.  Certainly - prior to the murder there were most definitely no such rumours whatsoever, Mr Chairman.  After the murder the rumours were to the extent that it was I who had killed Janine and not with anything at all to do with an affair with anybody else.  So I'm not happy at all with paragraph 3.3.",

With regard to that, I always wanted my amnesty application expedited.  It's not surprising to me at all that there were media reports and applications for amnesty concerning matters I've mentioned in my background etc., etc.  It's not surprising at all, Mr Chairman.

Just, if anyone over here has any doubts about my training or about, for example the depression, then there could be some type of indication for example, and then I could hand letter in from the person I've been seeing about that.  For example, my counsel wouldn't be in a position to argue that later on, Mr Chairman, unless it's been brought to someone's attention.  So that's only for that reason that I mentioned it.\n\tAs far as the NUMSA matter is concerned, Mr Chairman, it is so that at the time that I did this I did foresee that the idea would replicated in general, but in my amnesty application I can't ask specifically for amnesty for other matters because I don't, they're not within my personal knowledge, except that I am responsible insofar as the idea was replicated.  I just wanted to stress that, Mr Chairman.\n\tAt one point there was a suggestion that the meal at MacRib had cost R250 and that's not so.  The R1 000 I mentioned and the R9 750 that was drawn, that R250 difference was not anything to do with a meal at MacRib.  It certainly was not a sumptuous meal at all, Mr Chairman, pertaining to the NUMSA matter.  \n\tMr Chairman, the article in Mr Trengove's bundle, is an article in there by Mr Horak from the Mail and Guardian, concerning the NUMSA and those types of operations.  I'm not quite sure if that is a local newspaper, I think it may be a British newspaper.  The point being that I hadn't seen before anyway, before the start of this hearing.  Because we have a Mail and Guardian here and there's one in the UK as well.  I think this, that article was from the UK one, because as I understand it, Mr Horak at once stage skipped and went to the ANC in London and probably made the article there.\n\tAs far as the forms for transfer into, for the untransacted or unintended transfer into Judy White's account, Mr Chairman, the Nedbank form that was filled in which was never intended by me for any such transfer, I can just confirm that that was the case and that most likely the date on the top right-hand side of the form was already entered onto the form before I took it out of my briefcase.  That is could have been the case, if one has a look at the fact that the numbers slant different ways.\n\tThen I'd just like to mention that as far as the R30 000 divorce settlement, Mr Chairman, I just want to reiterate that at no stage, although I would have been happy to pay it, at no stage was I under any obligation to pay any divorce settlement to Janine, quite the opposite in fact.  Even during the meeting with Mr Mendelow I already told him then, any such demands or requests by Janine were ridiculous.  So I just wanted to make that clear, Mr Chairman.\n\tIn terms of the murder itself, Mr Chairman, it's been repeatedly suggested that I did that to save my own skin.  If I wanted to save my own skin, Mr Chairman, I could simply have joined the ANC, I could have sought political asylum in New Zealand ...(intervention)",

            "(s.u.o.)\n\tThank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, then I'll just state as a fact that I did not commit the murder to save my own skin.  And then I'd also like to say that I used the word \"political amnesty\" in respect of New Zealand in my previous evidence, when I meant political asylum at that stage, with regard to New Zealand.  That is all about that.\n\tAs far as the Evans document is concerned that was submitted by the LRC, it is so that Derek Broone is related to Olivia Forsyth, it is so that the Edwards brothers were involved in that circle, as Gavin Edwards sets out.  In fact Royd Edwards spent, lived in my house for a week once with Janine and myself.  The - he's quite wrong about the source Sylvia.  In fact I've subsequently asked Renata, who also knows Sylvia, to contact her and just see if she wouldn't want to make a statement or whatever and her response is contained in Renata's statement. - if anyone is wondering how it got there.\n\tThen Mr Chairman, at one stage I was asked about the bug on the telephone, I think by yourself, and what is correct is that I put the bug on my telephone prior to the holiday and not after the holiday.  After the holiday I got a better version of the bug from the Technical Division in Rebecca Street.  There - I was experiencing some problems with the bug, so I got a better one.\n\tMr Chairman, the murder was not butchery, it was not excessive or needless, I merely previously left it at that because I accept that Advocate Trengrove is putting to me the anger and hostility of the family.  So butchery in the sense of, in an emotional sense yes, I accept the anger and hostility, in a technical sense it's not needless or excessive.  \n\tAs far as the question of whether I'm predisposed to violence, I am assertive, I'm not aggressive and I'm not abusive, Mr Chairman.  \n\tThe J88 that was submitted or completed on the 6th of June 1991, Mr Chairman, refers to torn ligaments.  Torn ligaments is something which takes quite a long time to, not torn ligaments, it's not torn ligaments - it seems to me, I can't read the writing too well, but it seems to be an injury which actually needs plaster casting and all that kind of thing, Mr Chairman, and Janine never had that.  I don't recall her every having anything like that.  Also, she wrote a letter to her attorney, which is in Mr Trengove's bundle, shortly thereafter and she never mentions it. \n\tAs far as my perception, Mr Chairman, of the general authorisation, I can just that no-one ever instructed me specifically to do this, but I do believe that, my perception to be correct in terms of what I've said about that.\n\tThe notes that were copied during my previous testimony in February, Mr Chairman, I never read from those notes, but what I've neglected to say is that the, at the top of the page there's a reference to a spanner, which I've crossed.  The reason I crossed it out over there, Mr Chairman, is quite simply that that is what I was going to purchase, it's what I took at the shop, but I gave it back because it occurred to me while I was buying it in Pietermaritzburg that I wouldn't make it through the metal detector at the airport with such an object.  So if anyone's wondering about why that spanner is crossed out there ...  I understand that Mr Chaskalson was referring to it yesterday.\n\tAt one stage I had referred to a quotation in page 2 of Annexure C, which read something to the effect of behind every government there's secret services which keep the government in power, and notwithstanding moral codes etc., etc., or keep the government of the day informed.  I just want to make it clear that that is a typical Security Branch euphemism.  When we say keep the government of the day informed, what I understood there is keep the government of the day in power.  The word \"informed\" there is completely out of context and it's just euphemistically stated.\n\tI can state, I think, as one of my last points, my second-last point I think, Mr Chairman, that I did know more in, concerning my application for amnesty than what is prescribed for Annexure H with respect to the fact that the first step prescribed there for Stratcom is persuasion.  I tried my level best to persuade Janine to desist.  I for example to her to a marriage councillor, I reconciled with her, we went on holiday.  The next step prescribed is force.  I argued with Janine, I threatened her regarding playing with fire, regarding the Official Secrets Act, regarding the fact that it's potentially treason, it's treason what she's doing.  And then when I knew that she was not going to change her mind, the third step over there in terms of intensity is elimination, Mr Chairman.\n\tAs far as the various definitions of Stratcom are concerned, I can just point out that the war in South Africa was one of a very different nature, Mr Chairman, to any other war and perceptions were vitally important.  Stratcom was at the core of what was happening in the country, during all the phases of the struggle, right through the transition until the end.  Perception was central to that.  For every conceivable situation of conflict there is an application of Stratcom, Mr Chairman.\n\tLastly, I would like to refer to Annexure G, Annexure G of my amnesty application concerns, it concerns the duties with which I was involved at the time, Annexure G, it's signed by Lieutenant-General Smit, on page 6 of the annexure, Annexure G.  And what I want to refer to, Mr Chairman, is on page 7 on the top, page 7.  I can just point out that I was the senior captain mentioned on that page.  And in terms of the heading:\n\"Werksaamhede\"\nI was directly responsible for the following task mentioned over there, and that is:\n\"The psychometric and polygraphic evaluation of potential agents, journalists ...\"",

I even mentioned the word \"treason\" to her that night, but she said that she was furious and she intended doing it.  Our conversation then went on.  We had a personal conversation.

I mean there was Brixton Murder and Robbery Squad, which I can fully understand that at a scene of a murder they were called to be there, but how did they get to know about it?  You know these were all things that were crossing my mind.  How did they get to know about it when, they were investigating a murder and, you know as far as I knew the maid didn't know where Michael was based, people didn't seem to know.  So that was a funny little question that was raised in my mind.\n\tThen the other thing was that Mike's colleagues had gone home before him.  If I'm not mistaken he mentioned that they'd gone home on the Friday.  Michael was in Pietermaritzburg, I could not understand how he could possibly be implicated in the murder.  So I mentioned that fact to Detective Steyn.  He was at the time interested in it and asked me to elaborate, and I said I can't elaborate, I don't know, those are just feelings that I had.\n\tAnd then the next time I had a conversation with my brother, he was highly angry with me and told me I'm not to say another word about it and I'm not to mention the phone call, I'm not to say anything as all our lives, the family's and all of ours, his included, could be at risk over here and I was never ever to mention anything about the Security Branch again.\n\tSo that was basically the start of the threats to me.  Within a matter of a week or so my house was broken into.  Exactly a week later - I mean, we had just had a brand new Chubb alarm system fitted to this house, nobody else had the codes to this.  The alarm went off and somebody used to codes to switch the alarm off.  Exactly the same time the following week, exactly the same thing happened.  The first time only papers were rifled through, the safe, it had looked like somebody had tried to open the safe, they couldn't get into the safe.  The next week the same thing happened again.
