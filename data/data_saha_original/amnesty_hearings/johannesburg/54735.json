            "Thank you Mr Chairman, Committee Members.\n We are gathered here today in a spirit of peace and reconciliation. We believe that the time has come for a new era in South Africa'shistory.  The Afrikaner has struggled for freedom from BritishImperialism.  The African people have struggled for freedom. It is now the time for all South Africans to be free, free ofthe past and free of conflict.  We are part of the New South Africa. We believe in reconciliation between all the people of this country.\n As members of the security forces during the time of the strugglewe have decided to come forward in the spirit of this new country,in a spirit of trust in the new government and the Truth Commissionin particular, and with a purpose of cleansing our souls fromthe darkness of the past and to let the truth be spoken aboutour deeds.  We will tell all, and participate in these hearingswith the full knowledge that what we have done belongs to thepast.  That it belongs to the conflicts, ideologies and systemsof the past, and that we need to reflect upon our deeds, to repent,to search our souls for the truth, and to shed the burden of ourconscience which we have carried with us for so long.\n We believe that the process created by the promotion of NationalUnity and Reconciliation Act is a necessary mechanism to obtainthe truth, to weigh the motives and arguments of those who werepart of the conflicts of the past, to reflect thereupon, and eventuallyand ultimately to 1A learn/...\n8\nlearn therefrom for the benefit, not only of ourselves but offuture generations in South Africa and beyond.  Our actions andexperiences relate to a period of extreme violence and conflictin South Africa's history between opposing forces who have nevertried to understand each other or to reconcile differences ina peaceful way.\n The recent changes in South Africa represent an opportunity tobury the past, the conflicts of the past and the reasons therefor,and to build a new country for all the people of South Africa. It is with this belief that we have decided to come forward andto participate in the process of healing the wounds, discoveringthe truth and reflecting on our actions during the period of theconflict.  The time for deception is passed.  The time for denialis passed.  The time for conflict is past.  The time for refusalis past.  The time for repression of the truth is past.  The timefor justification is past.  The time for hatred is past.  It istime for peace.  It is time for reconciliation. It is time forhealing.  It is time for forgiveness.  It is time for truth. It is time for confession.  \n We do not believe that our endeavours to uphold apartheid wereworth the pain and suffering on both sides and we are of the firmbelief that the actions of both sides of the conflict were excessiveand unnecessary and could have been avoided.  We believe thatthe truth will assist in preventing such happenings to occur infuture in South Africa.  We have decided to come forward as webelieve, contrary to the leaders of the previous government andto our superiors in the security forces, that the time for conflictis past.  We call on all other members of the security forcesand the liberation fighters to come forward \n1A and/...\n9\nand participate in this process of reconciliation and nation building,as we believe that is the only alternative to further conflictand separation of the people of this country.  \n We will give evidence about our actions during the time of theconflict and will show that all our actions were purely and simplyassociated with the political objective, namely to uphold theNational Party government and apartheid, to fight communism andto resist liberation of South Africa and democracy for all inSouth Africa.  \n We are not criminals, we have never committed any criminal deedoutside the sphere of the conflicts of the past, and we have notread any extra financial or patrimonial incentives for anythingwe had done.  We believed that we acted bona fide in theinterests of our country and our people.  We will show that we,at all times believed that we were acting in the course and scopeof our duties and within the scope of our authority.  \n We will attempt to explain our actions in the political contextand against the political background of the time in which theywere committed, and we intend to explain the reasons for our actions. We express compassion and regret to the families of those whohave suffered as a consequence of our deeds.  We will endeavourto enlighten the world to the environment and background againstwhich we acted, the beliefs we held which were impressed uponus from our birth, the indoctrination to which we were subjectedand the political motives with which we acted.  \n We were brought up to believe in apartheid.  We were made tobelieve that apartheid was sanctioned by God through the church. We were made to believe that our participation \n1A in/...\n10\nin the security forces was justified to uphold apartheid.  Wewere made to believe that Black people were inferior and thatthe needs, emotions and aspirations of Black people differ fromours.  We were made to believe that we were superior and thatthese differences justified apartheid.  We have come to realisethat these beliefs were wrong, morally and in reality and we donot hold these beliefs anymore.  We believe that the example setby the President of South Africa, Mr Nelson Mandela, in respectof reconciliation, forgiveness and understanding should be followedby everyone in South Africa.  \n In the same vein we wish to refer to what General Jan Smuts saidabout South Africa already in 1917.  I quote,\n  \"The time has come now to speak about the past and thenbury it forever.  To take hands and to work together for a newcountry.  Tonight we are really met together here as members ofthe South African family, some born into it, some married intoit, some old servants who have gone grey in hard service and whohave given the best years of their lives to that service.  Herewe can all sit together forgetting Europe, forgetting the stormsraging outside and our minds can travel back to the sun-filledspaces of Southern Africa to its amazing history and its immensetask.  A great historian has said, on those whom the Gods lovethey lavish infinite joys and infinite sorrows. On that principlesurely South Africa must be a special favourite of the Gods. She has known joys and sorrows.  She has known the deepest abasementand she has known the highest auscultations\".\n1A We/...\n11\n We, as proud Afrikaners, are part of this country and shall bepart of this country in the future.  We are prepared to forgivethose who have sinned against us in the past.  We have forgiventhe concentration camps of the Boer War where innocent women andchildren had died.  We are prepared to forgive those who havewaged war during the struggle, also on innocent women and children. We similarly ask forgiveness for those who lost their lives andthose who were injured, and we share the grief of those familymembers of victims who have suffered during the era of the conflict. We have sincere regret that people have suffered on both sides,and we wish to express the sincere hope that the time for truthand reconciliation in South Africa has now arrived.\n We have made full disclosure of all relevant facts pertainingto our applications and we wish to say furthermore that from ourexperiences in dealing with the Truth Commission, up to now, wehave come to expect to be treated with compassion, understandingand fairness.  We therefore have belief in this process and commitourselves fully thereto.\n We call upon our superiors and the previous government not todeny responsibility but to stand by the people and to admit responsibilityfor what was done by us in our endeavours to keep them in power. We all supported the National Party until 1994.  What we haddone was always in the interests of the National Party and itsobjectives.  We believed in the policies of the National Party,and believed that we had to carry out our duties in support ofour party.  We state emphatically that we have been deserted bythe National Party and that we have, so-to-speak been thrown \n1A away/...\n12\naway in the gutter where we now have to take the responsibilityon our shoulders to deal with our past, to motivate our actionsand to present our view, as Afrikaners, of the conflict.  We callupon the previous government and our superiors to explain certainorders given to us about which we shall testify and to admit toauthorising actions outside the normal processes of the law suchas are demonstrated by the facts of our deeds and the authorisationthereof.  We seriously doubt the statement made by Mr F W de Klerkin the following terms in the National Party submission to thisCommission,\n  \"In dealing with the unconventional strategies from theside of the government I want to make it clear from the outsetthat within my knowledge and experience they never included theauthorisation of assassination, murder torture, rape assault orthe like.  I have never been part of any decision taken by Cabinet,the State Security Council or any committee authorising or instructingthe commission of such gross violations of human rights, nor didI individually directly, or indirectly ever suggest, order orauthorise any such action.  I feel in duty bound to also placeon record that the above statement with regard to my positionis also a reflection of the viewpoint of my colleagues who satwith me in Cabinet, the State Security Council or Cabinet committees\".\nWe ask from you do not desert us further.  Do not turn your backson us, help us.  \n We wish to end to quote an Afrikaans poem of the well-\n1A known/...\n13\nknown Afrikaans poet C J Leipold which is apposite to the endof conflict and the beginning of reconciliation.\n   (Starts in Afrikaans with no Interpreter)\n   And in mind for dreams\n   Give us the ability to laugh when life is hard \n   Grant us hope in the darkest nights of grief\n   Give peaceful rest to us all who live and struggle throughgrief and pain\n   Grant us the right ultimately to die \n   Grant us peace and rest and we will ask for no more but listenquietly to the wind which whispers softly in our ears 'Couragepeople, courage'.  Evil will be transformed into good and dawnemerge from the darkness\".",

The intention wasto make it clear that the people with whom we have cooperated,the people from the Truth Commission, or who are employed by theTruth Commission and I will name them specifically, these peoplehave treated us very well and we just wanted to place that onrecord.  We include Archbishop Desmond Tutu here, first and foremost. And we would also like to add the name of Dr Alex Boraine.  Alsothe name of Jasmin Suka, Andre Steenkamp and Advocate Mpshe.\n The only purpose of this statement which we made was to makeit clear that we have faith in the Truth Commission.  It was mentionedin the Press and in public that there are certain parties andgroups, especially from the security forces who have no faithin the Truth Commission and we just wanted to make the point veryclear that as a result of the way in which we were treated bythese people we have arrived at the point in which we have absolutefaith in the Commission.  We have never at any stage had any consultationsor talks with the members of the Committee now before us, regardingthe applications.\n1B May/...\n16\n May I beg leave to hand up the heads - oh have you received these,thank you very much.  I would want to place on record that thereare representatives here of the Attorney General's office andI would like to present them with copies of the heads of argumentas well so that they can follow the argument.\n I have been informed by Dr Pretorius, to whom I am handing thecopies of the argument now, I have been informed by him - he'sappearing on behalf of the Attorney General together with Mr Rigeldu Toit, that they will oppose this application and that theywill address you in respect of this application.\n The application is based upon section 29C of the Act.  Section29C of the Act reads as follows:\n  \"The Commission may, for the purposes of or in connectionwith the conduct of an investigation or the holding of a hearingas the case may be by notice in writing call upon any person toappear before the Commission and to give evidence or to answerquestions relevant to the subject matter of the hearing\".\n As I read the section Mr Chairman it provides a wide discretionto the Commission to call upon, in writing, upon any person toappear before the Commission to give evidence or to answer questionsin respect of the subject matter.\n If I can refer you to page 1.2 on page 2 of the heads of argument,\n  \"It is submitted that the Commission has the power in termsof section 29 of the Act to call upon the abovementioned personsto appear before the Commission and to give evidence or to answer\n1B questions\"/...\n17\n  questions\".\nThe abovementioned persons are all State witnesses in the State'scase against most if not all of the applicants.  The persons mentionedin paragraph 1.1 are Captain Jaap van Jaarsveld, Sergeant DionGous, Warrant Officer Andre Oosthuizen and Warrant Officer JoeMamasela.\n It is of importance for the applicants to have their versionspresented at the hearing to the Commission, corroborated by theevidence of the State witnesses, as well as affidavits and statementsmade to the Attorney General in the course of his investigations.\n Mr Chairman one should keep in mind that the applicants now haveto testify in these proceedings about happenings of ten yearsor longer ago.  Clearly they will not be able to remember everything. Clearly some witnesses will remember certain things and otherwitnesses will remember other things.  In that regard the applicantshave made full disclosure, but it is possible if one strives tohave the truth and the whole truth that some of the State witnessesmight add, will be able to add to certain parts of the evidenceof the applicants, and we say that that is important for the truthto come out.  We also say that that will serve to corroboratethe versions of the applicants and to show that they have madefull disclosure of whatever they can remember.\n Paragraph 1.4 we say that,\n  \"The Commission is requested to call upon the AttorneyGeneral of the Transvaal, in terms of section 29(1)(b) of theAct to hand over the dockets of their enquiries made by the AttorneyGeneral in respect of each of the applicants.  It\n1B  is/...\n18\n  is submitted that the statements made to the Attorney Generalby the above witnesses would be of material importance to theapplications of the applicants, and would assist the Commissionand the applicants in obtaining the truth and determining theapplications.\n  It is submitted that the Commission could only be requestedby the Attorney General to take steps aimed at the preventionof any undue delay in/or the disruption of any investigation orjudicial proceedings in terms of section 29(3) if the State witnessesshould be called as witnesses\".\nIf I can refer you to section 29(3).  Section 29(3) states that,\n  \"If the Commission is of the opinion that the productionof any article in the possession of the State, any departmentof State or the Attorney General, may adversely affect any intendedor pending judicial proceedings or the conduct of any investigationcarried out with a view to the institution of judicial proceedings,the Commission shall take steps aimed at the prevention of anyundue delay in or the disruption of such investigational proceedings\".\n Now it is possible that the Attorney General might argue thatto call a State witness and to provide statements of State witnessesto the applicants might adversely affect the intended or pendingjudicial proceedings.  There are pending judicial proceedingsagainst Brigadier Cronje, Captain Hechter and Captain Mentz atthis point in time.\n Now in respect of that we submit to you that section\n1B 29(3)\n19\n29(3) only becomes applicable after a decision has been made orwas made by the Commission to subpoena such witnesses.  We sayin paragraph 1.8,\n  \"As judicial proceedings against Brigadier Cronje, CaptainHechter and Captain Mentz have been postponed such judicial proceedingscan obviously not be affected.  It is therefore only the investigationwhich could  possibly be affected. Even though the Attorney Generalopposes this application it is not clear in what way the investigationwould be affected if the dockets are presented to the Commissionat this hearing.  It must be clear that the investigations havealready been finalised in the light of Brigadier Cronje, Hechterand Mentz as they have already been, they haven't been asked toplead but their cases have been postponed.  They have been arrestedhowever\".\n Paragraph 1.14 we submit, we say, \n  \"It is submitted that these State witnesses might possiblybe requested to answer questions which might incriminate them\".\nThis is a possible argument that the Attorney General might wantto raise.  We submit that this would then have to be dealt within terms of section 30(1)(2) of the Act which makes specificallyprovision for this.  This section says that,\n  \"A person referred to in subsection 1, that is a personwho was called to be questioned by the Commission shall only becompelled to answer a question or to produce an article whichmay incriminate him or her if the Commission has\n1B issued/...\n20\n  issued an order to that effect, after the Commission, firstly,has consulted with the Attorney General who has jurisdiction...\"\nand the Attorney General will address you now on this,\n  \".... has satisfied itself that to require such informationfrom such a person is reasonable, necessary and justifiable inan open and democratic society based on freedom and equality\".\nWe say in this regard that the proceedings that we are dealingwith now, relating to truth and reconciliation is clearly, clearlyrequires that as much information as possible should be placedbefore the Commission and that to order State witnesses to provideevidence and to make available statements in dockets by the AttorneyGeneral would be reasonable, necessary and justifiable in an openand democratic society which strives for freedom and equalityand strives for the truth.\n Then the last paragraph,\n  \"Has satisfied itself that such a person has refused oris likely to refuse to answer a question or produce an articleon the grounds that such an answer or article might incriminatehim or her\".\nI don't know what the attitude of these witnesses might be, butsurely if they are requested or questions are asked pertainingto the commission of certain deeds which might be criminal actsthey would, in all probability, want to rely on their right againstself-incrimination.\n We say that section 31 was specifically included to deal withinter alia the question of State witnesses being calledat hearings before criminal proceedings.  We say \n1B that/...\n21\nthat, and we make that submission because of the fact that section31(2)(a) refers to a consultation with the Attorney General inrespect of a question asked to a witness where he has to incriminatehimself.  The involvement of the Attorney General gives the indicationand creates the perception that this section was included in theAct to also make provision for a situation where a State witnessor a possible State witness might be called at these proceedingsbefore criminal proceedings take place.\n We say in paragraph 1.17,\n  \"Such a reference would not have been included in section31 if this situation was not contemplated.  This means that thedecision to make a decision pertaining to the use of prosecutionwitnesses at a hearing of the Truth Commission becomes the Commission'sdecision and falls within the discretion of the Commission\".\nSection 19(7) makes provision for the stay of prosecution in theevent of criminal proceedings having been instituted.  It doesnot make provision for the stay of an amnesty application beforecriminal proceedings.  The intention, therefore, is that amnestyapplications should be dealt with first and should receive priority. If the intention of the legislature was that criminal proceedingsshould be the first priority the Act would have specifically statedso.  Then we say that priority of amnesty applications might alsosave the taxpayer legal expenses if the amnesty is granted eventually. Nowhere in the Act provision is made for the exclusion of a specificcategory of persons from the ambit of the Act and from becominga witness in terms of section 31 of the Act.  It would have beenexpected of the\n1B legislature/...\n22\nlegislature to exclude persons if the intention was to excludeanybody.  Prosecution witnesses should therefore not be treatedin any other way than any other witness.\n We submit that the proceedings before this Commission are completelydifferent proceedings from criminal proceedings and that the factthat criminal proceedings are pending should have no influencewhatsoever on the Commission's decision in this regard.\n Paragraph 1.20 we say that,\n  \"Evidence by a prosecution witness cannot be used againsthimself in later criminal proceedings so there cannot be any prejudiceto any prosecution witnesses if they should incriminate themselvesin these proceedings\".\nIt is clear that the Attorney General wants the benefit of hearingall the facts of the deeds by other witnesses such as the applicants,and to utilise it in his preparations of any criminal proceedings,especially in the case of a hearing where the evidence presentedto this Commission would have been done without confidentialityattached thereto.\n On the other hand the Attorney General does not want to participatein these proceedings by making available State witnesses who mightcorroborate the applicant's version and who might also assistin this Commission to get to the truth of the matter.  \n It is furthermore submitted that the principals in respect ofaccess to dockets in criminal cases as set out in the recent caseof the Constitutional Court in Tshablala v Attorney General,Transvaal, are not applicable to the question currently underconsideration.  As those \n1B proceedings/...\n23\nproceedings are not criminal proceedings, the same as these proceedingsare not criminal proceedings the same principles cannot be applied. And we submit that the only basis upon which this applicationcan be determined is the Promotion of National Unity and ReconciliationAct.  \n As you are all probably aware of the Tshabalala case providesfor a discretion of the Court on certain grounds to allow thedefence to have sight of documents in the docket, especially statements,and also to consult with State witnesses.\n We submit furthermore that it is important to note that the evidenceof the State witnesses will also deal with aspects surroundingthe security forces and not necessarily only with the evidenceof the deeds.  The evidence which they will present will thereforehave a much wider ambit than the information available to theAttorney General.  We do not understand how the Attorney Generalcan then be of the view that such witnesses, where they will beused and specifically I wish to refer you to Captain Jaap vanJaarsveldt where they will be used if they are called as witnessesto give evidence about a lot of wider aspects than simply thehappenings and the deeds.  Captain van Jaarsveldt can, for instance,shed a lot of light on certain instructions and orders that weregiven on the background in respect of the dealing with informationby the Security Branch.\n As long as the Attorney General does not want to allow thesewitnesses to give evidence at the Truth Commission this informationwhich is also relevant to the applicant's applications will notbecome available to the Commission and will not be disclosed tothe Commission as part of the \n1B process/...\n24\nprocess to seek the truth.  We say that in the international contextit's ...(intervention)",

On the other hand one cannotsee why the applicants will not speak the truth as they are heredealing with this process.  So we say that it would be to theadvantage of everybody concerned that the truth comes out andwe are sure that the truth will come out if they all speak thetruth.\n We submit in an international context it has always been a vexedquestion if amnesty should make in-roads into the State's responsibilityto investigate and prosecute grave human rights violations.  Inmost instances where transition of power has taken place, in worldhistory recently, amnesty prevailed.  The was the case in El Salvador,Argentina, Guatemala and recently Haiti.  In most cases severeopposition was experienced by various parties to the grantingof amnesty and especially blanket amnesty.  In each instance theimportance of truth and reconciliation prevailed.  \n It is therefore important, we submit, to take the \n1B international/...\n26\ninternational experience into account when consideration is givento the interests of the Attorney General as against the interestsof the Truth Commission, and we refer to certain internationalarticles dealing with this whole issue between the State's responsibilityto prosecute human rights violations on the one hand and the provisionof amnesty on the other hand.\n It is therefore submitted that it is imperative in the lightof the intention of the Act and with reference to the ambit ofthe Act that all evidence pertaining to the applications of theapplicants will be placed before the Commission so that the truthcan prevail.\n The Commission is therefore humbly requested to issue subpoenasor to allow subpoenas to be issued against the four State witnessesreferred to in the heads of argument and to subpoena the AttorneyGeneral to provide the Commission with the dockets pertainingto each of the five applicants referred to above.\n I want to make one last submission.  If there might be a possibilitythat the Attorney general feels that if the evidence should bedisclosed, publicly by State witnesses that the criminal proceedingsmight be prejudiced we submit that at least the statements inthe dockets which need not be read into the record but which canbe presented to the Commission on a confidential basis, then beobtained and presented to the Commission to assist in obtainingthe truth and considering the applications of the applicants.\n There is therefore a middle-of-the-road alternative which wewould suggest in that regard.  That would then mean that thesewitnesses would not testify or otherwise the witnesses could possiblytestify in camera so as to not \n1B prejudice/...\n27\nprejudice the criminal proceedings in future, and it can be orderedthat only the necessary people can be available or present whensuch evidence is taken down.  All we say is we want the truthto come out.  That is what we say.  And we say that will supportus in our amnesty applications will show that we have been bonafide, that we have disclosed the truth and will corroborateour versions and will help this Commission furthermore in dealingwith these amnesty applications.

Since late 1994 the Attorney General's special investigation unithave been involved in an investigation and enquiry concerningthe aspects relating to these three applicants.  I have also seethe heads of argument by my learned friend today and I would liketo refer to these later, if it pleases the Committee.\n Firstly, my learned friend perhaps conceded and that was alsothe attitude of the State right from the start, I must make itclear that the Attorney General is not opposed to any amnestyapplication or the hearing of the amnesty application here, itis simply the integrity of the prosecution which is in issue. So we would like to oppose\n1B the/...\n31\nthe application for subpoenas, firstly on the basis that it ispremature.  His five applicants are now applying for amnesty. At this stage it is totally premature and I would like to sketchthe potential prejudice which could follow this kind of procedure.\n The history of the criminal procedure in South Africa has clearlyproved in the past, you might for instance recall we had preliminaryinvestigations in the past as a result of the suggestions andrecommendations of Judge Hiemstra inter alia, that potentialprejudice which could result due to the exposure of too much Stateevidence has been emphasised.  I have also had the privilege ofbeing involved on more than one occasion where evidence, witnessestestified before a Committee and later that led to criminal proceedings. I take here as an example the Boipatong investigation and forinstance the case currently before the Goldstone Commission.\n The potential prejudice locked up in this approach where Statewitnesses are unnecessarily exposed is that we can then obtaina previous record which in later criminal proceedings may be usedto in a tactical and contextual way enquire and investigate theissue and to say you use this and that word before the Truth andReconciliation hearing and today you use a different word andin such a way one can continue ad nauseam to refer to discrepanciesand the minutes tick by as an attempt is made to find discrepanciesbetween the evidence of the State witnesses in the one forum andthe evidence given later.  \n So it is not an issue of the State witnesses not speaking thetruth.  None of us are capable of using exactly the same wordson two different occasions.  So in the \n1B history/...\n32\nhistory of the South African criminal procedure system and theabolition of the provisional enquiries, it is only too clear thatthere is the possibility of potential prejudice if State witnessesare unnecessarily exposed.\n The first point that the State would like to make is that itis a totally premature application.  The other point which mustbe made is that the office of the Attorney General.. (Tape 1 ends)\nTAPE 2A DAY 1\n...to be called and then the question could be put to the InvestigatingOfficer, that which you heard from the applicant is that in linewith the image, the picture created in the docket that the Statehas or not?  Are there differences of nuances etc?  In this wayrepetition could be avoided.  \n If my learned friend simply wants to use this evidence for corroborationfor a repetition it is not necessary and I maintain that it ispremature.  At the end of their case, if there are then certainproblems, omissions, for instance if there are certain answersonly to be given by Jaap van Jaarsveldt there are methods, thereare ways in which the office of the Attorney General could beapproached to seek a solution for that situation without the necessityfor the witnesses testifying viva voce and be subjectedto long and protracted cross-examination.  So the State is formallyopposing application for the subpoenas.  \n In the same breath we have to say that you must be aware thatthe Attorney General will give his full support to help you inyour very difficult task.  So that must also be stressed.\n As far as the second application is concerned I don't \n2A want/...\n33\nwant to dwell on that for too long, that is the application tohave insight in the docket, the Tshabalala decision isreferred to.  This is the wrong forum to bring such an applicationand the Tshabalala did not abolish the State's privilege. It would not be valid for you to say that the docket should nowbe disclosed.  I don't say that it is relevant to this particularcase.  It's obvious that the five applicants in this case areaccomplices and with your experience in the courts you will knowthat there are certain dangers regarding the evidence of accomplices. The cautionary rule, that is a rule which has taken shape inan evolutionary way over a process of time for a very good reasonand it is possible that applicants such as these could stay onthe line of truth because they have such an intimate knowledgeof the facts and simply where it suits them or where it is essentialor crucial you then have an aberration in their evidence.  Soit's imperative that the State looks at the interests of justiceand that the integrity of the prosecution must constantly be guarded. \n So we therefore formally oppose this application that subpoenasbe issued at this stage for the State witnesses.\n I must tell you I only received the heads of argument this morning,and before I deal with those very briefly it must also be understoodthat each of these witnesses has his own individual interestsat heart.  I went to a great deal of effort to contact all theState witnesses and to ask them what their attitude would be inthis particular case, and here we must make a distinction betweenthe attitude of Mr Joe Mamasela, for instance, and the attitudeof Mr van Jaarsveldt.  And I would like to explain Captain vanJaarsveldt's attitude to you and refer to a letter which I \n2A received/...\n34\nreceived from his attorney and I would like to hand that in tothe Bench and allow me to just read it into the record.\n  \"The Chairperson, Committee on Amnesty, Cape Town.\n  Sir\n  re: Amnesty applications Brigadier Cronje, Colonel Venter, CaptainHechter, Captain Mentz and Warrant Officer van Vuuren.\n  We act on behalf of Mr J J H van Jaarsveldt and our client'sname is mentioned in the media as a State witness who will appearbefore the Committee in the interests of truth and reconciliation. It is so that our client is a State witness in the criminal caselaunched by the Attorney General of the Transvaal against theabovementioned people for a case which is contemplated againstthem.  We understand that the Attorney General proposes objectingany application to an application that our client be asked totestify as a witness.  Although we have understanding for thefact that the Attorney General does not want to prejudice thefuture prosecution it is our client's approach that he, at thefirst possible opportunity, will make a full disclosure regardingcertain events and you are therefore notified that our clientis at all times willing to testify before the Commission.  This,however, is based on the State's possible opposition to that andespecially the decision to which your Committee, after considerationof all submissions may reach.  Our application for amnesty hasbeen sent to the Attorney General today and it has been signedby\n2A his/...\n35\n  his attorney\".\n The reason why I've found it necessary to read this letter toyou is to indicate the attitudes of the State witnesses to showthat they are only too willing to help if necessary.  Neverthelessit is the State's argument in this particular case that it isa premature application and that in truth there will be prejudiceif you accede to this demand at this stage.  \n If there is anything in particular you might wish to ask me aboutthe Tshabalala decision or the disclosure of the docketsyou could perhaps give me an indication.  I ask permission tohand it in to the Bench.",

We cannot anticipate the findings of this Committee and the possibilityof a prosecution is always there.  The integrity of the prosecutionmust always be protected and that is my respectful submissionin this regard.  There are five applicants in this case, fiveapplicants for amnesty.  We don't know exactly what their\n2A cases/...\n36\ncases will be. We don't know whether there will be any omissionsin their cases, defects in their cases, we don't know whetherit is necessary at this stage that any of the State witnessesbe exposed.  \n My submission is that there is a middle-of-the-road option. As my learned friend conceded there is this middle-of-the roadoption which can be used.  Let us first hear the case for theapplicants to, at this stage, say that the people must be subpoenaedcan damage the prosecution's interest.  And that is our submission.\n There is another danger which should be just mentioned in a generalsense.  If there's a grouping that feels that they want to applyfor amnesty they can decide in anticipation to blame only oneperson and to blacken this person's name to such an extent thatthe possibility for a prosecution in future is so remote becausethat person has already been discredited in another forum andthe blame has been loaded onto his shoulders entirely.  So thatis a danger which you must constantly bear in mind, that if youhave a grouping of conspirators or co-conspirators they may thendecide to lower the blame onto one of the State witnesses so thatthis could minimalise the possibility for a prosecution in future. And for that reason it is premature, because we are not yet awareof what the applicants are going to say, whether it will merelybe a repetition and whether the State witnesses will be able tomake any substantial contribution to this amnesty application.",

            "Yes please Mr Chairman. I am going toanswer in Afrikaans to what my learned friend argued.\n Firstly, I would like to make the point that it appears to bequite clear to us that the Attorney General does not believe thatthe applicants will be granted amnesty, from that perspectiveDr Pretorius is arguing as if it is a foregone conclusion thata criminal prosecution against the applicants will in fact takeplace after these proceedings.  If anybody, therefore, is prematurewith any statement then it is Dr Pretorius himself who is prematurein his assumption that the applicants will not be granted amnesty.\n If the applicants are to be granted amnesty in respect of theirapplications then there will be no criminal \n2A prosecution/...\n38\nprosecution and the Truth Commission will then suffer.  The truthitself will suffer as a result of that, and the whole processof truth and reconciliation will suffer in the process.  The questionwhich one must ask oneself after listening to Dr Pretorius isif one weighs up the interests at stake here which interests mustbe put in the balance according to Dr Pretorius?  The intereststo be weighed up are the discrediting of potential State witnessesagainst the withholding from the Truth Commission.\n Now the submission which I would like to make in this regardis that unless I have misunderstood it completely the interestsof this Commission and the work with which it is engaged at themoment and the truth ought to weigh more heavily than the merepotential future discrediting of witnesses.  What Dr Pretoriushas of course neglected to mention is that the possibility thata State witness will be able to put forward exactly the same versionmight not discredit him but actually be to his advantage.  \n We also find it strange that the Attorney General, and Dr Pretoriushas now confirmed that the investigation has been going on overa long period of time has regarded it  necessary in regards ofCronje and Hechter in the course of last week when it became knownthat these hearings would take place, tried to arrest BrigadierCronje and Mr Hechter, to arrest them and to bring them beforeCourt.",

            "As it pleases Your Lordship, I will leavethat issue there.\n As regards Dr Pretorius' points he made the specific point thatthe application currently before the Committee is premature. He referred to the history of our Criminal \n2A Procedure/...\n39\nProcedure Act but the important point which he didn't mentionis the fact that in this country we have never had a Truth Commissionand we've never had to grapple with these issues, or the issueof where there are two processes involving the same kinds of evidencesuch as for instance criminal proceedings and the Truth Commissionwhich process should be given precedence and for that reason Itried, in my heads of argument, to try and refer you to the internationalnorms and experience, and how it's dealt with internationally. And as I tried to show and is clear from the articles which Iquoted in all cases in Argentina, in Chile, Guatemala and Haitiwhere amnesty was granted precedence was given to the amnestyprocedure rather than criminal prosecution procedures.  Althoughin South Africa, if there is no blanket amnesty to be given youhave to actually apply for it we are respectfully submitting thatthe same situation should obtain in this country.  The processfor obtaining amnesty should be given precedence over the criminalprosecution process.\n Dr Pretorius also referred to the potential prejudice of thediscrediting of State witnesses, that there might be a previousrecord which could be used against a witness at a later proceeding. In the first place there's section 31(3), the provisions of thatsection that where such a witness gives incriminating evidencethe record may not be used against him.  \n Furthermore it is so that in our judicial system there are recordsavailable in certain cases which may be used in evidence againstcertain parties.  It may happen that a criminal case takes placeand after that a civil case and the record of the criminal casemay be used in the later \n2A one/...\n40\none.  It is not a totally unheard of procedure in South Africanlaw and it is not something so foreign to our legal system thatwe cannot deal with it.  If the Attorney General has faith inhis State witnesses and in the evidence and the veracity of theevidence he would have had no hesitation in saying that his witnessescould testify because he would know that their witnesses would,more than likely give the same evidence at a criminal prosecution.\n I must, however, concede that a witness whose evidence is alreadyon record may be in a somewhat weaker position as a result ofthe questions which may be put to him.  This should not be sucha persuasive factor, however, that this Committee should considerit fit that the truth should take a second place.\n I would also like to refer to the previous procedure in the CriminalProcedure Act where there were provisional enquiries and evidencewas heard before the actual trial during these preliminary hearingsthe same process is actually still followed during military courtmartials in terms of the Defence Act, and there the evidence ofa witness is available beforehand to the various parties and sucha witness may be cross-examined on that evidence.  And that appliesspecifically to witnesses for the prosecution.  Dr Pretorius,my learned friend, referred to the fact that an investigatingofficer may be called, that is hearsay evidence, and we can seeno reason why an investigating officer should be called insteadof the actual witness themself.  My learned friend also did notanswer the point I made right at the outset when I said that someof the witnesses, and especially Captain van Jaarsveldt, couldoffer other testimony which would be far wider than mere \n2A criminal/...\n41\ncriminal activities.\n My learned friend also referred to the Tshabalala decisionand mentioned the fact that this is the wrong forum to deal withconsultation and acquiring of evidence from State witnesses aswell as the disclosure of documents. During the investigationsof the Attorney General the Tshabalala decision, as I havealready said, deals with the situation where you have a criminalcase in a court and the Court is actually given the discretion. Here we are dealing with the procedure of the Truth Commission,and our submission is that the Truth Commission has a discretionwhich it can exercise in this respect and that the Tshabalaladecision is actually not relevant.  I am also not relying on theTshabalala decision to say that the Commission must nowexercise the same discretion as the court in terms of the Tshabalaladecision.  The only aspect in which the Tshabalala decisionmay support the applicants is the fact that it has changed thelegal position regarding having insight into State witnesses statementswhich was previously not the case.  It, therefore, strengthensthe applicants' cases somewhat.\n We take note of the difference of attitude between Captain vanJaarsveld and Joe Mamasela but we make it very clear that we areof the opinion that whether the witnesses have an interest inthese applications or not, it's in the interest of everybody thatthese witnesses testify.  As far as Mamasela is concerned he hastestified beforehand.  He has been interviewed on television. His evidence is on record and if he is to be discredited duringthe State's case then he might just as well be discredited asa result of that evidence.\n2A The/...\n42\n The last point I'd like to make is that after listening to theAttorney General's argument it would appear as if one needs toweigh up the various interests between the question of whetherwitnesses in a later criminal prosecution might be discreditedand that must be weighed up against how important the truth isto the Truth Commission. Those are the two interests to be weighedup one against the other. \n With that in mind I submit that the witnesses should be subpoenaedand we request the Commission to do that.  And we are requestingthe Commission to also subpoena the Attorney General to discloseto the Commission and the applicants all the documents relatingto the cases in his possession.  Thank you.",

If criminal proceedings should commence, if amnestyis not granted later, those applicants who have been prosecutedalready or have been brought before the court, namely BrigadierCronje, Captain Hechter and Captain Mentz will, in the light ofthe Tshabalala case, in all probability be entitled tohave sight of the statements and documents in the docket.

The only possibility might be, and I must concede that, is thata court might refuse them access to the dockets.  Now the possibilityof that seems, in my submission, remote.

The applicants are so bona fide inmaking full disclosure that they say that we don't necessarilywant to stand or fall by our applications.  We want to do everythingin our power to place the truth before the Commission.  And thatis why we say that for the sake of truth we regard it as importantfor the Commission to hear evidence of some of these witnesses. One must remember that in certain instances some of these witnesses,and I am thinking of Joe Mamasela specifically, was involved ina way where the other witnesses weren't present.  I don't wantto disclose evidence but for example he would have spoken to certainpeople to whom the applicants haven't spoken.  So all the applicantscan testify about that is what Mamasela had told them.  Now ifMamasela comes and he testifies and he tells the Commission exactlywhat did he speak to these witnesses about?  What transpired whenhe did 2A certain/...\n45\ncertain things alone?  It could help to paint the full pictureand that is what the applicants say. \n In respect of the question of applicants not being able to rememberyou would have noted that in some of these applications, especiallyCaptain Hechter says that he starts with the background and thefacts of certain matters and he says, I cannot remember anythingabout this matter.  The version that I place before the Commissionin my application is the version of my involvement in this mattertold to me by Paul van Vuuren. I know Paul van Vuuren so wellthat I accept the truth of what he says.  If he says I did somethingthen I believe that and then I apply for amnesty in respect ofthat deed even though I can't remember a thing.  That just goesto show the problem in dealing with matters which occurred tenyears or more ago.  And it is possible that some of these Statewitnesses might throw light upon some of the actions of the applicantswhich might be important in respect of certain of the factorsthe Commission should take into account when the Commission hasto consider amnesty.  \n I specifically want to refer to the grounds in section 23 wherethe Commission has to take into account certain factors to decideif an act was associated with a political objective.

Mr Chairman Mr Mpshe has just pointedout to me that that would obviously then entail the evidence ofGeneral van der Merwe who is the first witness that I want tocall and not then the other witnesses thereafter\n2B before/...\n48\nbefore judgment is given on this application, as I understandyou correctly.\n Mr Chairman there is just one other issue before I go ahead tocall General van der Merwe which I want to raise with the Committeenow so that clarity can be obtained in respect of that issue forthe future.  We have a concern pertaining to the interpretationof section 31(3) of the Act dealing with incriminating evidence,and the fact that it's provided therefor that incriminating evidenceshall not be admissible as evidence against the person concernedin criminal proceedings.\n If on reads section 31(3) closely it refers to the following,\n  \"Any incriminating answer or information obtained or incriminatingevidence directly or indirectly derived from a questioning interms of subsection 1 shall not be admissible as evidence\"\nThat only relates to a questioning in terms of subsection 1. Now subsection 1 says,\n  \"Any person who is questioned by the Commission in theexercise of its powers in terms of this Act or has been subpoenaedto give evidence....\"\nthere is a clear distinction between a person who is questionedby the Commission and a person who has been subpoenaed to giveevidence.  \n Then I want to refer you also to section 29(c) which deals withthe right of the Commission to subpoena witnesses which says that,\n  \"By notice in writing call upon any person to appear beforethe Commission and to give evidence or to answer questions relevantto the subject\n2B matter/...\n49\n matter of the hearing\".\n Now the applicants are concerned that if they are regarded asthe category of persons who are to give evidence at the hearingin terms of section 29(1)(c) and not to answer questions theywill not fall under the auspices of section 31(3) and any incriminatingevidence they might give in these proceedings might be used ina criminal case against them later.  The only point I want toraise here in conjunction with the Committee is that I want toplace it on record and I wish the Committee to agree with theapplicants that the applicants are at this hearing, although theyhaven't been subpoenaed, as a person who is questioned by theCommission as meant in section 31(1) and that the applicants willthen fall under the auspices of section 31(3) and incriminatingevidence by them will then be evidence derived from a questioningin terms of subsection 1.  We would request the Committee to,if possible, if the Committee is prepared to do that to stateon record that the applicants are regarded as witnesses who arequestioned by the Commission and that according to the Commissionand the Committee that they fall under section 31(1) and 31(3).",

The only factor that worries theapplicants and which is a bit - something that is not clear fromthe reading of section 31 is that a person is only covered inrespect of incriminating evidence if that evidence is derivedfrom a questioning in terms of subsection 1.  And subsection 1refers to two categories of persons.  Firstly a person who isquestioned by the Commission and secondly a person has been subpoenaedto give evidence.  Now on the reading and interpretation of section31 it is possible that a person who has been subpoenaed to giveevidence might not fall under the umbrella of section 31(3) whichis a problematic factor and which means that incriminating evidencecan be used in a criminal case against such a person.

            "I am a retired member of the SouthAfrican Police who previously served as Commissioner of Policefor the period 1 January 1990 to the 31st of March 1995.  I alsoserved as Commanding Officer of Security Branch of the South AfricanPolice for the period 1 January 1986 to the 30th of September1988.  And as Deputy Commissioner of the South African Policefor the period 1 October 1988 to 31 December 1989.\n On the 3rd of September 1996 I, together with three other formerCommissioners of the South African Police, namely Generals MikeGeldenhuys, Johan Coetzee and Hennie de Wit submitted a memorandumto the Commission.  The role of the South African Police in theconflict of the past was briefly set out in the said memorandumwhich is attached as an annexure to this statement.  I am notgoing to deal with this memorandum Mr Chairman.\n I have had the opportunity of perusing the contents of the applicationsfor amnesty to the Commission by the following former membersof the South African police, Brigadier Jack Cronje, Colonel RoelfVenter, Captain Jacque Hechter, Captain Wouter Mentz, WarrantOfficer Paul van \n3A Vuuren/...\n58 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nVuuren.  I have now been subpoenaed to appear before this Committeein order to give evidence pertaining to these applications andI hereby declare myself willing to do so.\n With regard to the contents of paragraph 20 - 33 of the saidmemorandum I would firstly like to deal with some of the factorsand circumstances which existed during the conflict which mayhave had a fundamental influence on both the thinking and conductof members who were initially involved in the violence which raged. I am well aware of the numerous views and interpretations whichthis Committee has to take account of and I will therefore endeavourto deal with these matters as comprehensively as possible.\n The conflict and violence of the past took on various forms andcovered wide-ranging scenarios which included combatting rolewas in both Namibia and Zimbabwe as well as acts of terror, sabotage,killings and acts of mass mobilisation and mob violence withinthe borders of the Republic.  Members of the South African Policewere employed and utilised with regard to all these terrains andaccordingly over a period of time the training and operationaldeployment of the South African Police had, of necessity, to beadapted accordingly.  This ultimately was to lead to the naturalconsequence of the bringing about of drastic changes in the outlook,approach and training of that which previously had formed thefoundation of an acceptable policing culture in a normal society.\n Amongst other things the principles of minimum violence and thebringing of perpetrators before criminal courts was to be seriouslyaffected and even eroded.  This state of affairs appertained especiallyto the utilisation of counter-insurgency tactics in a guerillawar which in \n3A many/...\n59 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nmany an instance revolved around that which normally applied ina conventional war.  In the Republic the violent struggle wasprimarily waged between the security forces and elements of Umkhontou'Sizwe, better known as MK.\n Although MK, from a truly military perspective disposed of onlya limited capability it must be stated that it undoubtedly enjoyedthe support of the majority of the Black population in South Africa. After the founding of the  United Democratic Front in 1983 transpiredthat the levels of resistance and violence directed at the Governmentand its institutions would rise dramatically thus forcing theGovernment to implement drastic security measures such as emergencyregulations and preventative detentions in order to try and quellthe rising unrest and violence.  The South African Police wassubjected to enormous pressure to try and stabilise the situationby, amongst other things, arresting and detaining activists whoplayed a significant role in the unrest or charging them and bringingthem before court.  Members of the South African Police, and especiallythose attached to the security branch were required to work nightand day for long periods of time in order to carry out their duties. The greater portion of the Black population were ill-disposedtowards the South African Police.  \n Many members were to lose their lives as a direct result of thepolicies which were formulated at an important ANC national consultativeconference held in Kabwe, Zambia, during June 1985.  This conferencewhich took place at the same time as the 30th anniversary of thecreation of the Freedom Charter was being celebrated was to passcertain resolutions which was to have an undeniable impact onthat which was to occur later in South Africa.  \n3A Under/...\n60 GNL VAN DER MERWE\n Under the editorial I quote: \n  \"We are revolutionaries, internationalists and Africans. \n  Following paragraphs in Tshichaba, the official publicationof the ANC adequately described the entire direction and moodof the conference.  Deficiencies and shortcomings in this regardwere also pointed out.  The recurring theme of the conferencewas to intensify the armed struggle.  Some people favoured theterm \"armed seizure of power\" rather than \"seizureof power\".  It was this realisation which led to the decisionthat we must attack not only inanimate objects but also enemypersonnel.  \n  This ANC conference which took the form of a Council of Wardecided that the distinction between hard and soft targets shoulddisappear.  This was not a new idea.  It had been discussed, likeall other issues in the numerous continual regional pre-conferencediscussions which involved everybody including all those who werenot elected as delegates to the conference.  In other words theANC membership as a whole was involved for the last nine monthsor so in discussions which took place at the conference.  Theattack on South African refugees in Botswana, by the racist forcesjust before the conference emphasised the need for our movementto bleed the enemy.  The question of intensifying armed struggleposes new challenges and responsibilities on the ANC and on theinternational community which by the look of \n3A things/...\n61 GNL VAN DER MERWE\n  things and the nature of the violence of the enemy is goingto be more involved in that struggle for our liberation\".\nThat is the editorial of the Tsichaba of August 1985.\n The decision that in future there was to be no distinction betweenhard and soft targets was to have very important ramificationsand consequences for South Africa as a whole, more especiallyfor the general public at large.  It immediately became obviousthat among other things this declaration was to be a flagrantviolation of that very undertaking which the ANC ostensibly heldso dear, namely the signing at the end of 1980 of Protocol 1 of1977 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 when it was declared thatit's future actions, inter alia only be directed at militarytargets.  Articles 1(52) and (57) being especially relevant.\n It had already become apparent during 1983 that the ANC, as previouslyindicated, had already reconciled themselves to the fact thatinnocent civilians could be killed or injured in future MK attacks. According to an article in the Tsichaba of January 1983 it wasstated that, I quote,\n  \"Also reported have been 15 instances of bombs in citycentres, shopping areas, public buildings and places of entertainment\".\nAfter another consequence which arose from both the Kabwe Conferenceand an earlier visit by a high-powered ANC delegation to Vietnamduring 1978 under the leadership of the late Mr Oliver Tambo wasthe gradual implementation of the so-called \"People's WarStrategy\".  \n The delegation, which also included Mr Joe Modise and the lateMr Chris Hani, came to the conclusion that armed \n3A actions/...\n62 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nactions had to be supported by political actions which includedthe mobilisation, organisation and politicising of the massesaround certain grievances.  This was regarded as a prerequisiteto create a revolutionary climate and to initiate a people's war. Thereafter the National Executive Committee of the ANC decidedon a three year plan aimed at mobilising and politicising theBlack population.  \n The underground structures of the ANC would be used for thispurpose.  Other channels which were to be used included sympatheticorganisations, distribution of pamphlets and the establishmentof revolutionary themes for the ensuing years.  Themes included1979 the Year of the Spear; 1985 the Year of the Cadre; 1986 theYear of Umkhonto u'Sizwe, the People's Army; 1987 the Year ofAdvance to People's Power; 1988 the Year of United Action forPeople's Power; 1989 the Year of Mass Action for People's Power.\n To add to this idea in 1980 the Central Committee of the SouthAfrican Communist party issued a statement entitled \"Forwardto People's Power - The Challenge Ahead\".  It stated thata strategy of armed struggle can only be effective and take shapeif it is rooted in the broadest possible mobilisation of the organisationsof the people and in mass legal and semi-legal battles.  The build-uptowards the winning of people's power called for an even greateremphasis in the strengthening of mass movements at national, regionaland local level.\n A further requirement according to the ANC for the successfulimplementation of a people's war was the creation of alternativestructures responsible for mobilising and organising the masses. It must be borne in mind that the theme selected by the ANC foreach year were a useful \n3A propaganda/...\n63 GNL VAN DER MERWE\npropaganda tool in this mobilisation process. People's War statutewas described as, I quote,\n  \"A war in which the entire nation is engaged. Umkhontou'Sizwe, the People's Army, workers, the rural masses, women,intellectuals, the religious community selectively in groups oras organised individuals who use all forms of provisional warfare,armed or non-combat, legal and illegal means to attack and destroyall symbols and structures and organs of apartheid power includingall those who manned them\".\n  The long term and fundamental objective of the ANC/SACP alliancewas the total destruction of the South African state.  After analysingthe situation in the Republic during 1983 and again in 1985 theANC came to the conclusion that masses entered a new era in theirstruggle.  It foresaw political demonstrations followed by semi-armedactions by the masses using rudimentary weapons at first, suchas sticks, stones and pangas.  During 1983 the political militarycouncil of the ANC issued a document planning for a People's War. According to this document the ANC directed it's attention towardsa protracted guerilla war, mass uprising, arming the masses andpreparing them for a People's War for the establishment of alternativestructures and the revolutionary basis.  \n In this document the ANC visualised accelerating the activationof the masses in proceeding from peaceful non-violent politicaldemonstrations to demonstrations with emphasis on violence andinsurrection.  Stone was ultimately to be replaced by petrol bomb,acid bomb and hand grenade while firearms such as the AK 47 assaultrifle became a \n3A substitute/...\n64 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nsubstitute for the stick and panga.\n During 1984 and virtually each year thereafter the ANC announcedthat in future the revolutionary war would rest on four pillars,namely, \n (a) the armed struggle led by Umkhonto u'Sizwe,\n (b) mass mobilisation of the masses,\n (c) the underground structures of the ANC,\n (d) the international offensive to isolate the Republic of SouthAfrica.\n At the same time a call was issued by the late Mr Oliver Tamboto make South Africa ungovernable.  The destruction of local authoritieswas seen to be part of this process.  This was followed by thebrutal murders of a number of community councillors, administrativepersonnel, police officials and other persons who in any way assistedthe State.  These murders and killings often occurred by meansof the dreaded necklace method.\n By June 1985 it was reported that only five of the 38 Black governmentstructures had survived and 396 innocent people had already beenmurdered.  In destroying these structures the ANC was createdthe necessary prerequisites for liberated zones.  The ANC andits front organisations embarked on campaigns of murder intimidationwhich left a vacuum in the townships.  In this manner the ANC/SACPalliance hoped to create no-go areas and total ungovernability.\n The vacuum created was aimed at having a dual effect.  Informationfrom the townships would not reach the security forces.  In thecourse of no security force presence unrest would continue andsteps would be taken to create revolutionary bases.  Once a revolutionarybase had been \n3A created/...\n65 GNL VAN DER MERWE\ncreated for a people's war it could develop and grow and providea safe haven for trained MK cadres returned to the country ina clandestine fashion.\n MK was regarded as the core of the people's army which consistedof three components.  One is the advanced detachments of MK intothe politicised masses and previous sympathetic or recruited membersof the security forces which included the South African DefenceForce and the South African Police.\n The ANC instructions to MK were that they should operate in organisedunits with the following objectives. Deployed units in the ruralareas were instructed to mobilise the local inhabitants.  Undergroundunits in the urban complexes and factories and in Black residentialareas were to form combat, sabotage and elimination groups.  Thesecadres would react normally during the day and operate at night. The establishment of self-defence units whose primary purposewas to protect the organisation against State activity.  MK memberswere instructed to give the necessary guidance to these units. \n Politicised masses which formed the second component of the revolutionaryarmy would be recruited, trained and supplied with arms by theadvanced detachments of MK members.  Thereafter they were to beorganised into disciplined combat units.  Training was to takeplace internally.  This would circumvent the problem of only personsbeing recruited were prepared to leave the RSA for training. Dissident national servicemen, Black soldiers, officers and therank and the file were regarded by the ANC as potential recruitsto form the third component of the people's army.  It was statedthat Whites should not be \n3A encouraged/...\n66 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nencouraged to refuse to do their national service but that theyshould rather be used clandestinely within the South African DefenceForce as organisers and agitators.\n To shift the balance of forces in favour of the ANC it was decidedthat that should be launched from the revolutionary bases in theBlack townships against White areas.  These attacks would be carriedout by combat and defence units using trained cadres and directedat the security forces, both Black and White.  \n Furthermore, attacks would also be aimed at strategic and economicinstallations which were regarded as the lifeline of the Whitepopulation.  As far as the rural areas were concerned it was decidedthat farm workers and labourers must be involved in order to seizethe land.  Attacks had to be directed at farmers and their familiesin the border areas with landmines being used in many of theseattacks.  The street, alley and block committees were to be usedto bring about a revolutionary transfer of power.  People's Committeeshad to be developed into so-called organs of people's power. The purpose of creating organs of people's power was to establisha situation of field power, namely the forces of the revolutionon the one hand and the force of the State on the other. The organsof people's power were designed so that people's lives were directedin a new revolutionary way.  \n These structures had to lead the all-round offensive employingall forms of action.  Organs of people's power were to be electedby the people in the street and they were to be responsible tothe people.  Regular meetings were held so as to determine thepeople's needs and requirements.\n Another organ of people's power was the so-called \n3A People's/...\n67 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nPeople's Courts.  They were originally regarded as instrumentswhereby the so-called concept of people's power could be upheldand defended.  That task was to ensure healthy, revolutionaryand democratic inter-relations within society and to serve theinterests of the people in general.  To ensure this state of affairsthe boards were tasked with dealing with cases of anti-socialbehaviour, conflict and political crimes against the people. It was these people courts which progressively implemented a campaignof terror and intimidation in the Black townships against thepopulation who had very little or no defence or protection inthis regard. It was very often quite sufficient to be merely suspectedof being a sell-out or collaborator in order to pay the ultimateprice in the most dreadful manner.   With the notable exceptionof a few cases where a perpetrator was caught red-handed theseacts of violence and other offences committed with a politicalmotive were generally speaking to go unpunished in the propercourts of law.  This can be directly attributed to high levelsof intimidation which firstly neutralised the effectiveness ofthe intelligence network and secondly the victims of witnesseswho were totally unwilling to come forward in order to bear testimonyagainst those responsible.\n As already indicated over many years the liberation movementsregarded armed attacks on members of the security forces beingso-called legitimate hard targets as morally acceptable.  Thiswas to result in many policemen being killed or injured whilstengaged in combatting ordinary crime in performing their normalpolice functions.\n Of significance is the fact that this type of activity was toescalate even more sharply during and subsequent to \n3A 1990/...\n68 GNL VAN DER MERWE\n1990 when the negotiation process and that which was to bringabout the election of a new democratic government was alreadywell and truly on course.  In this regard the following statisticsare revealing.  During the years 1973 to 1979, that is six years,76 policemen were killed.  From 1980 to 1990, ten years, 270. From the 1st of January 1991 till the 31st of December 1992,that's two years, 385.  During 1992 2204 politically motivatedattacks on policemen took place killing 145 and injuring 363.Whilst during 1993 267 members were killed in 4165 acts of violence. \n In regard to some of the other acts of violence perpetrated underthe banner of the people's war strategy the following statisticswith regard to only two categories, namely the necklace methodand death by otherwise setting alight of persons are reflectedhereto after so as to present some idea of that which the SouthAfrican Police had to cope with in this particular regard.  \n I am not going to quote all the statistics Mr Chairman.  Perhapswhat is important that during 1986 306 persons were murdered bymeans of the necklace method and during the same year 171 setalight and burnt to death.\n With your permission may I proceed with paragraph 16 Mr Chairman?",

            "GENERAL VAN DER MERWE",
            "As a direct result of this particularrevolutionary climate the South African Police and the South AfricanDefence Force were compelled to pool their various resources tocombat the ever increasing tide of unrest and violence.  Jointplanning was undertaken in terms of the various structures ofthe national management system which functioned under the authorityof the\n3A State/...\n69 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nState Security Council and which also incorporated the constitutional,economic and social affairs cabinet committees.  All governmentdepartments were eventually drawn into the national managementsystem in an all-out effort to find solutions to the ever-increasingsecurity problem.  However, despite all these efforts describedabove the security situation in South Africa continued to deteriorateand the climate of violence and unrest increase.   Members ofthe security branch of the South African Police came to experienceharsh practical problems in communicating with their sources oragents and even being able to ensure their personal safety. Incases where the slightest suspicion existed the suspected informeror agent was eliminated, sometimes in the most brutal fashion. Incidents such as car bomb explosions, limpet mine and hand grenadeattacks and other acts of terror which members of the police andtheir families as well as ordinary civilians were exposed to overa lengthy period of time were to lead to a hardening of attitudesand the creation of a climate of hate, both within the ranks ofthe police as well as that of the civilian population.  Thesefeelings of emotion reached new peaks every time innocent anddefenceless women and children were the victims and this was furtherexacerbated by the feelings of frustration which existed amongstmembers upon realising that their ability to protect both theircolleagues and the community against such terror attacks was becomingmore and more limited.\n The fact that both MK and eventually the Azanian People's LiberationArmy, APLA, members started using neighbouring frontline statesas a springboard for launching their armed attacks against theRepublic led directly to the 3A establishment/...\n70 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nestablishment of a cross-border capability aimed at eliminatingor neutralising this very real threat.  \n A counter-revolutionary intelligence task team was created andcomprised members of the National Intelligence Service, the SouthAfrican Police and the South African Defence Force.  It was theirtask to properly evaluate and coordinate all intelligence regardingthe revolutionary threat facing the Republic and especially withregard to identifying and prioritising political targets whichposed such a threat.  These threats could be in the form of anindividual, a group, an organisation and accommodation or logisticalfacility and were prioritised in terms of the level of potentialdestabilisation each target posed.  \n In this particular regard another aspect which must be bornein mind is the fact that this task team were of necessity alsorequired to look at the internal situation as the revolutionaryactivity of the insurgents escalated.  This included situationsregarding ...(indistinct) who assisted the insurgents with accommodation,storage facilities, transport, financial assistance as well asproviding active assistance in the establishment of arms cachesand in some instances the actual transporting in a clandestinefashion of such arms and explosives.  Armed attacks my MK andAPLA insurgents were therefore often followed by cross-borderraids aimed at utilising the intelligence provided by the taskteam referred to so as to neutralise the facility of your concern.\n The prevailing circumstances which I have sketched up to thispoint would have a further dimension, perhaps already alludedto namely, both the lowering of the morale of the community andthe security forces and the hardening \n3A of/...\n71 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nof attitudes amongst both groupings.   This was accompanied bythe belief that the enemy had to destroy no matter what.  Thisoutlook was in turn aggravated to a great extent by speeches andpronouncements by ...(indistinct) and commanding officers in varioussectors of the security forces.\n It is undoubtedly so that militaristic and political inspiredspeeches often made it difficult for the security forces becomingmore and more emotionally involved to be able to distinguish betweenthat which was normally justifiable in terms of the law and thatwhich was not.  This status quo led to members of the securitybranch who had to deal with the most horrendous manifestationsof violence on a day-to-day basis ultimately becoming equallydisillusioned and negatively influenced regarding these matters.\n During 1986 I personally became involved in a situation wherecertain drastic measures had been implemented in order to protectand save the lives of Black members of the South African Police. At this juncture I was a commanding officer of the security branchand certain reliable properly evaluated information had been receivedto the effect that a group of activists were planning armed attackson the private residence of Black members of the South AfricanPolice who resided in a number of townships on the East Rand. I may point out at this particular stage many of the townshipson the East Rand, including Thokoza, Katlehong, Deduza, Daveytonand Vosloorus were amongst the most politicised and destabilisedin the Province of Transvaal.  This situation was to continueinto the 1990's and the activities of the SDU's in these areaswere eventually to be 3A subjected/...\n72 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nsubjected to intense scrutiny and investigation by various sub-committeesof the Goldstone Commission of Inquiry.\n It is unquestionably so that since the implementation of thepeople's war strategy during 1984 the South African Police wereexperiencing greater and greater difficulties in both maintaininga proper presence in the townships on the East Rand and Vaal Triangle,carrying out effective policing in the said areas. \n At the time it was the declared intention of the ANC/SACP alliance,assisted by such organisations as the ANC Youth League, Cosatuand various civic organisations to literally drive the policemenfrom the townships.  This was to be accompanied by utilising anymeans of violence specifically at policemen which is clearly illustratedby the steadily increasing death rate amongst policemen over aperiod of time.  For example during the period 1973 to 1979, 76policemen were killed, the period 1980 to 1990 270, and 1991,161, '92 224, in 1993 267.\n In regard to the instances referred to in the preceding paragraphit became very obvious that any attempt to arrest the activistsconcerned and bring them before court would be futile to say theleast.  Primarily due to the high intimidation factor which precludedany witnesses from coming forward.  It also became equally obviousthat the life of the informer concerned would also be in the gravestdanger should any such action be taken.\n It was also abundantly clear that other preventative measureswould have to be taken so as to protect the lives of the policemenconcerned who by now were very frightened and totally demoralised. Information to hand indicated very clearly that the group ofactivists concerned were only \n3A awaiting/...\n73 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nawaiting the delivery of a consignment of hand grenades from anarms cache before launching their attacks against the homes ofthe policemen.\n After due consideration of all the relevant facts I decided thatthe only way the Black members could be protected against suchattacks was to ensure that the activists were provided with handgrenades which had been suitably modified.  Modifications to thetiming mechanism fuse of the grenades would ensure that any personthrowing such hand grenades at the home of a policeman would beaffected first due to the shortened time delay.  I then made arecommendation to this effect to the then Commissioner of PoliceGeneral Johan Coetzee who in turn presented the recommendationto the Minister.  Louis Le Grange was then the Minister of Police. Mr Le Grange approved the relevant recommendation.  I thereafterdiscussed the matter with Brigadier Jack Cronje and duly delegatedthe execution of the task to him.  He was pertinently instructedto ensure that the modified hand grenades reached the group ofactivists under the guise of having been furnished by the ANC. Under no circumstances was any incitement to commit an offencetherewith to take place.  They were merely to be handed over tothe group and any further action by utilising the grenades wasto be left to the group themselves.\n A number of hand grenades and a limpet mine were later channelledto the group of activists through a certain person who had contactwith them.  It later transpired that a number of these activistswere killed and injured when they launched a series of armed attacksagainst the homes of policemen resident in the area.  Anotheractivist was also killed when attempting to sabotage an electricalsubstation \n3A by/...\n74 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nby using a limpet mine.\n During 1988 I received an instruction from Mr Adrian Vlok thenMinister of Law and Order to the effect that the building knownas Khotso House was to be damaged by explosives to such an extentthat it could no longer be utilised.  According to Mr Vlok thisinstruction had come from President P W Botha personally.  Itwas common knowledge within security circles at the time thatthe building concerned served as a sort-of internal headquartersof the ANC where resistance campaigns, unrest and violence wereplanned and where financial and other assistance was providedto MK members who had infiltrated into the country.  Accordingto information explosives were also stored in the basement ofthe building.\n Despite being in possession of a great deal of information regardingcertain unlawful activities taking place within Khotso House thePolice were powerless in putting a stop to it as no informer oragent was prepared to give evidence in court regarding such activity. Mr Vlok was emphatic in stating that the maximum effort mustbe made to ensure that no lives were put at risk when carryingout the operation.\n I then delegated the instruction to Brigadier Willem Schoon,who at that stage commanded the Vlakplaas Unit and once againemphasised the question of not putting lives at risk.  The instructionwas duly carried out at a later date and the building was so badlydamaged it was rendered no usable.\n I am fully aware of the fact that the actions of various membersof the security branch and other members of the South AfricanPolice, as defined in certain instances \n3A which/...\n75 GNL VAN DER MERWE\nwhich may be placed before this Committee, as well as that ofthe Human Rights Violation Committee may in present circumstanceswhere proper knowledge and awareness of the background to theviolence and ...(indistinct), as well as the emotions involvedis gradually fading appear to be cold-blooded and murderous ofnature.\n I am also equally aware of the fact that there are many membersof MK and Apla who were directly involved in the conflict whoare currently wrestling with identical problems to those beingexperienced by serving and former members of the South AfricanPolice and services.  Because of the variety of individual andgroup perceptions and problems the said members of the South AfricanPolice and the services as well as those of MK and Apla are decidedlyunwilling to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commissionor to give evidence.  \n For this very reason under the guidance of Deputy President ThaboMbeki various discussions were held between former members ofthe security branch, the South African Defence Force and MK inan effort to start a process to convince those concerned to presentthemselves to the Commission so as to be able to place the pastin its proper perspective.\n Thank you Mr Chairman.",
