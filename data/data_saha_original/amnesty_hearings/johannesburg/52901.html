<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, with your indulgence, I thank you for that and if possible can we proceed with the matter that was standing down before lunch?  Thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, we call the matter of De Meillon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, before we start, there's a household matter, there's a request from certain applicants' attorneys and even from certain applicants if you would allow people to remove their jackets in the circumstances, if there is no objection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes I think I should consult with my colleague Advocate Gcabashe in that regard, she will have the final word.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No I see she's got no objection.  In that case we are overruled and the majority of the panel has got no objection, gentlemen, if you want to make yourselves more comfortable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That concludes the evidence of the applicant and I will attend to obtain the application form for his membership and once I have done so, I will hand it in for your perusal.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Prinsloo.  Mr Kotze?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I think we might have some problems with the microphone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Might I request then that you move it ever so slightly?  Are you comfortable where you are seated, Mr Kotze, you are seated right on the edge of the table, would you like a little bit more room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>	Very well, would you like to discuss the matter of Mr Holder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> As it pleases you Chairperson, I call Mr Holder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">EDWARD WILLIAM HOLDER:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR KOTZE:</span> Thank you.  Mr Holder is it correct that you are a 37 year old electro-mechanic and that you are the applicant in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Is it correct that you are married and that you have two children who are currently respectively 15 and 13 years old?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Is it also correct that on the 5th November 1996 you were found guilty on charges of robbery with aggravating circumstances and murder and for each of these charges you were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment to be served concurrently?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And this emanated from an incident which occurred on 23 April 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Have you had any prior convictions except this particular one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Mr Holder, if we could just begin with your background?  In which environment did you grow up?  Where did you undergo your education?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> In Krugersdorp, primary and high school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And after you passed matric is it correct that during 1979 and 1980 you performed your military service?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that's correct in Ladysmith at 5 Infantry Battalion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you follow any advanced courses there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> An officers course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you achieve a rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes, that of corporal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And as part of your military service and your obligations thereof, you performed duties in Namibia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> For how long were you on the border?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Approximately one year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And during this border duty, were you involved in any contact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct, two incidents of contact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And were any of your friends injured during this military contact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you lose any members of your family as a result of the border war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct, my cousin Reino.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And was there anything specific about his passing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> He was one of the last who died during border duty and that was during the operation when they withdrew the land from Namibia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And during your military training and border duty were any discussions ever held with you in order to motivate your presence on the Namibian border?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Could you briefly expand regarding this motivation and these discussions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Discussions about the border focused on communism and the fight against communism, they indoctrinated us extensively against communism and the ANC in it's entirety.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> At that stage was the ANC also regarded by the army as an enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And this threat of communism, if you could just expand of that?  What would that threat involve in general for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> For me it would have meant that free religion would no longer have existed, that the free market economy would have collapsed and that everything that we believed in and everything that we had been taught would have been destroyed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Until the point of your border duty, what were your political orientations, for which political party did you vote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I think if one is young one votes for the party which your parents voted for, therefore I would have voted for the National Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And the policy of the National Party at that stage was one of separate development, how did you feel about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> At that stage I felt it was entirely correct and acceptable that we should develop separately with regard to schooling, churches and with regard to our countries in their entirety.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And were these impressions made to you at school level?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> After you completed your apprenticeship, you then in 1983 joined the Secunda Town Council as an electro-technician?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And from 1984 you were in service at the Secunda Mine in the same capacity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And in the meantime you were married and you had these two children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did your political affiliations change at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Since 1993 my political affiliations have changed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And what was the reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> The environment in which I lived was overwhelmingly occupied by Conservative Party members and all of them were predominantly right-wing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And with the withdrawal of the South African forces from Namibia what was your view then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I felt that all the troops who had died on the border had died unnecessarily, that they had been shot unnecessarily because we had lost the land that we had protected with our lives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And at that stage then did you begin to believe that the National Party did not keep it's promises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And then at a stage you joined the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That was December 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And for which reason did you join this organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I thought that with the assistance of the AWB or by means of the AWB we would have some form of political influence on the elections which were coming and the outcomes of these elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And what was your feeling when you heard that President Mandela was to be released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> First I was shocked because I felt that he was one of the leading figures of the then enemy and this had been indoctrinated in our minds by the army, I felt that he was part of the enemy of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> In Secunda, which is overwhelmingly a white mining community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And you said that it was predominantly occupied by conservative membership and thoughts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Were any political meeting held between December 1993 up to the elections of April 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> From an AWB perspective meetings were held and attended approximately every week as well as Conservative Party meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> How regularly were these AWB meetings held in Secunda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Once a week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And if you could just expand on the stature of the speakers, were they lower level speakers or high level right-wing politicians?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> High level right-wing politicians.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And what was the broader range of these meetings which you attended?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Most of the time it was that the National Party at that time was busy selling our country out as it had done with the then South West Africa and for us as whites there could be no sovereignty or own piece of land or territory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And this message, did you only hear it from AWB leaders or also from the Freedom Front and Conservative Party speakers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> From the Freedom Front as well as Conservative Party speakers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And this message, did you believe it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes I believed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> With regard to AWB meetings, could you briefly indicate whether they were public gatherings or gatherings for members only?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> The meetings began as open gatherings which could be attended by anyone and after the public gatherings there were closed meetings only for AWB members and supporters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> These public gatherings, let us accept that non-AWB members also attended these meetings from time to time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well it depended from meeting to meeting, it could have been a hundred people or more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Were you under the impression that the right-wing politics were firmly established in the environment in which you lived and worked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is how it appeared to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Could you briefly focus on the atmosphere before the elections took place on 27 April 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I think the atmosphere before the elections was one of insecurity, we were all very uncertain of what would happen to us after the elections and that is why we attempted to politically ensure that there would also be something left over for us at the end of the day, a sovereign Volkstaat where we could maintain our norms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you believe or what did you believe would happen on the election day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I believed that we were on the bring of a civil war and I think that many other AWB and right-wingers believed this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> On local government level, were any notices given out amongst the public in Secunda regarding what could be expected with regard to the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> We received notification of those things which we would need during a civil war and we all believed and we still believe that this came from the local town council.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> This document to which you refer, is this the document which appears from page 57 to page 59 of the bundle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> At that stage when it's mentioned, the aspect of fleeing, you and your family must flee, there is no time to pack, did you believe that this evaluation was not correct and I'm referring to page 59, the introduction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Chairperson, I believed that on the day of the election there would be no time for packing, we would have to leave our things and flee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> After a number of guidelines are provided, the writer ends off with "May God help and protect us".  Did you have any reason to believe that this, which appears to me to be a very earnest and serious plea for protection was ungrounded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> During these AWB meetings or gatherings, was any indication given regarding how the AWB wanted to organise itself in the event of problems which may originate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Chairperson, we had safe houses, as we called it, where we would have taken our wives and children in such an event and where we as the men would protect them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And when was it believed that this event would take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> We believed that this would take place on election day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> So the idea of the safe houses was that women and children would gather there and that some of the men would then protect them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Which weapons did you and the other members of the AWB have available to you to carry out these duties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Most of us had handguns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And which weapons did you believe were in the possession of the enemy of that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Semi-automatic combat weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And did you believe that the weapons at your disposal would have been effective against the power which you believed existed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> If you could briefly sketch the then structure of the AWB as it existed in Secunda, were there any ranks and who occupied these ranks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well our chief commandant for the region was Commandant Boshoff, then there were two other commandants below him.  Our commandant was Ochert van Schalkwyk and below him was Lieutenant Flip Marais and then it was me and my fellow applicant Mr van Zyl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you occupy any rank in the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> The ranks which you have mentioned sound like military ranks, could you indicate upon which basis this rank structure functioned within the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> As far as I know it was very similar to that of the South African Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> The organisation as such, was it simply a social gathering of people who shared the same political objectives or was there a method according to which military methods would be used in the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> We addressed our seniors according to various ranks and saluted them as one would do in the defence force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And if there had been requests which were issued did you regard it as a request or something stronger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I regarded it as an order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Was at any stage a discussion held regarding the obtaining of automatic rifles to protect the safe houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> When did this happen?  If you could just sketch the circumstances briefly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> It was approximately two weeks before the incident during which the victim died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And who did you talk to at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I was attending a meeting at Mr van Schalkwyk's house, he spoke to us and there were other members present there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And you and Mr van Zyl were friends, both personally and professionally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And he was also a member of the AWB at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Who ultimately introduced you to Mr de Meillon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Mr van Schalkwyk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And you said this took place two weeks before the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> In which capacity was Mr de Meillon introduced to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> He was introduced to me as a commandant of the BWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Was any indication given regarding his loyalty towards the Boer cause and any other such issues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Mr van Schalkwyk told us that De Meillon was very trustworthy and loyal to his cause.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And were any instructions given to you regarding assistance that you should give to him and the BWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Mr van Schalkwyk told us at this stage that there would be opportunities and times during which the AWB and the BWB would have to co-operate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Now the BWB, at that stage did it have any kind of familiarity in Secunda?  Did you know what they stood for and what they were planning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I simply knew that they were also a right-wing organisation.  However, I wasn't entirely certain for what they stood and what they were doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> But it was clear to you that they would attempt to influence right-wing politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you then undertake any exercises with the BWB members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Can you expand on that briefly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> We had drills with vehicles and obstacles as well as night watches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And who was involved in these night shooting and obstacle courses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Various AWB and BWB members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And was the emphasis on the idea that there would be an attack on a vehicle and you would have to know how to protect these vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you at that stage believe that the threat of an attack on a convoy of vehicles was a real danger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes I believed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> With regard to the 23rd April 1994, that was the Saturday before the election, how did it transpire that you an Mr de Meillon and Mr van Zyl departed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I was not at my house, I was at Mr van Zyl's house, my fellow applicant, and we were visiting there when Mr van Schalkwyk and Mr de Meillon arrived there.  Mr van Schalkwyk told me that Mr de Meillon and the others knew where they would be able to get semi-automatic weapons for the safe houses and as I understood it, there was an arsenal of weapons which was illegally possessed and that the guards were usually drunk and that it would be rather easy to obtain these weapons, that we were to go with Mr de Meillon.  I went to fetch Mr van Zyl and informed him of the situation and we departed with Mr de Meillon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you know exactly what your destination would be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Mr van Schalkwyk told us that the destination was a place in Pretoria which was being observed by the BWB and that they knew what was going on there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Could I interrupt?  Sorry.  When Mr van Schalkwyk said Mr de Meillon knew where to find semi-automatic rifles, was this said in the presence of Mr de Meillon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> He was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you then arm yourself for this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I didn't specifically arm myself, it was general AWB policy that at all times, in and outside town, we would carry firearms with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you then take a .38 revolver with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And Mr van Zyl took a single barrel shotgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And then you went with Mr van Zyl's vehicle in the direction of Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> In Pretoria, how did it come that let's call it the first target was pointed out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well I don't know Pretoria well and I don't know how the city's set up is, what the street layout is like and Mr de Meillon asked Mr van Zyl to go to, what's the street name, Vermeulen Street and we trailed up Vermeulen Street, we stopped next to the building there which is the military headquarters.  There were guards there and he wanted us to take away these guards' firearms from them and I asked him whether he was off his rocker when he wanted us to take away their firearms, I meant that I wouldn't do it and it was open, in the public, there were many people passing by, I was not prepared to get involved in a thing like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And how long did you spend in Pretoria before this planning was terminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well I didn't take notice of the time but it wasn't very long Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Were any proposals made that the action would have to achieve propaganda value?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes, Mr de Meillon said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> What was the idea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That if we were to attack these guards and rob them of their firearms it would have propaganda value because we could say that the BWB had committed this and this would give us some influence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Given the danger, would you prepared to try and obtain or achieve this propaganda value?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> In the end then you departed from Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct, we returned to Secunda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And what happened on the way to Secunda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Just after passing Delmas we stopped next to the road and Mr de Meillon said to us that we had to go via Devon because that was one of the targets that they had observed, that they had attended military camps in the past and he knew exactly what was going on in the bases and that we had to just stop there, when we passed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> You heard his testimony today that he had only on a few occasions in Pretoria driven past the building and that it had been quite some time since he'd last been in Devon.  If it had been stated to you in those circumstances would you have been prepared to participate in this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Then in Devon, did Mr van Zyl remain behind in the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> What did Mr de Meillon tell you was the purpose of this visit to the base?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well Mr de Meillon said we had to pass there, go and see how many guards there were, what arms we could get there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Were you prepared to go along with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> You and Mr de Meillon then put on your military browns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And you also pulled a vest over your head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> What was the purpose behind that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Chairperson, if you had undergone military training you would know that your skin is white and it would reflect very easily at night and that was simply to disguise my complexion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> So you believed that this would make you less obtrusive at night while you were reconnoitring this place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Was it indicated to you at any stage that the plan was that people were going to be shot or specifically the guards were going to be shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> If that had been disclosed to you what would your action have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I would not have gone along with the action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And ultimately you arrived at the guardhouse.  At that stage who according to you occupied that base?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I believed that is was an airforce base according to what Mr de Meillon said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And when you arrived at the guardhouse, what did you believe would transpire there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I believed that we would take a look to see how many guards there were, so see if there were guards on the grounds and so forth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And then depending upon whether or not they were there and whether or not they were awake, what would have happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I thought that we would have reconnoitred an arsenal which was familiar to Mr de Meillon perhaps for later action or if the opportunity presented itself and there was minimal risk, we would have stolen the weapons ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> The events occurring in the guardhouse, could you sketch this to the Committee and could we just indicate to you Chairperson that the events as they appear in paragraph 18 of the application, it has appeared after consulting with the applicants on Monday that there are certain discrepancies.  Would you like me to make a proposition to you regarding what their testimony would be or could I just guide the witness through this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that with regard to paragraph 18 on page 25 of the record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Yes, page 25 carrying on on page 26 of the record. CHAIRPERSON:   I think lead him through this and if there are really radical differences then you have to deal with those.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Mr Chair I would just like to point out that when my turn arrived, the first applicant had already testified and very little could be done about that.  But could you please explain in your own words what had happened in the guardhouse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well I stood at the window and as Mr de Meillon had said, he passed below the window and stood at the door.  I look in through the window and saw that Mr de Meillon entered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Sorry, can you slow down, you're going to fast?  So you looked through the window and he definitely did not, you observed that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct, he passed under the window. Then Mr de Meillon stood at the door, I look through the window, I saw he entered, I immediately followed him, I entered the guardhouse, Mr de Meillon and the deceased became involved in a struggle.  I approached Mr Swart and I saw that he was drawing his firearm.  I grabbed him by the shoulder and the elbow.  I heard a shot go off, then I pushed Mr Swart out of the way and I ran.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did the lights in the guardhouse go out at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct, the lights did go out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> What caused it according to your impressions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I don't have an idea, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And at what stage of the incident did the lights go out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well it was during the struggle between Mr de Meillon and the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> How many shots did you hear in that guardhouse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I heard one shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Could you perhaps give us an indication of the size of this guardhouse where this whole incident took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well I would guess about four by four but I could be wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> After hearing the shot, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well I ran out the guardhouse to the motor car where Mr van Zyl was working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> In the guardhouse did you pick up Mr Terblanche or Constable Terblanche's firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Was any attempt made to search or look for further firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No we didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Then you ran to the motor car and Mr de Meillon joined you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> When did you become aware that a firearm had been removed from the guardhouse to your waiting car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well only after the car had departed or pulled away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Who made an announcement in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Mr de Meillon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did he also at that stage have the firearm pistol in his possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Mr de Meillon also had a wound in his forearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair, he informed us that he had been shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Would you know who had shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I don't have an idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> The moment the shot had been fired would you say you were in a position to make a dependable observation about what had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Mr Chair, I was too afraid, I was scared and I ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Okay, I would like you to focus on that very moment when the shot was fired which apparently had killed Mr Terblanche.  Could you tell whether the firearm had been pointed at him, whether it had gone off in the struggle, what were your personal impressions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> My personal impression was that a shot had gone off while they were struggling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you fire any shots in the guardhouse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> When you were in the motor car did you remark anything towards Mr - did Mr de Meillon remark anything with regard to the shooting incident there to any of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes he made the observation afterwards to me and Mr van Zyl that he thought the guard had been shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> You then went to Secunda, was Mr de Meillon in the motor car throughout that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes we departed from Devon to Secunda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And then at Secunda you dropped him off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Was there any arrangement regarding the reporting of this incident to your structure of command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> After we had dropped off Mr de Meillon we went to Mr Gerhard van Schalkwyk's house.  When we stopped in his yard he was already waiting for us and he told us that Mr de Meillon was already there, we had to return home, he would contact Mr van Schalkwyk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> That was Mr van Rensburg's house where you stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you at that stage know Mr Gerhard van Rensburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes I had only met him on the same occasion as Mr de Meillon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Was he introduced to you by a rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes he was introduced as a general of the BWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> During these night shooting and convoy protection operations and exercises, was Mr van Rensburg also there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes he was in command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> What was the arrangement during the course of such an operation?  Who would be in command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Are you talking about the exercises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Well we are referring to AWB/BWB co-operation, who would be in command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I take it it would be the person with the highest rank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> During this whole incident did you take any initiative in carrying out the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Who would you say was in command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Mr de Meillon I would say, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Do I understand correctly that although you had only seen him once he was then introduced to you and an announcement was made regarding his dependability and loyalty, you were prepared to undertake this kind of action with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Why did you act in such a manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I believe it was out of fear for what we believed was going to happen and also to obtain the firearms to protect our wives and children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> You were then arrested and accused of murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> You were initially charged together with Mr de Meillon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And then a division of trials took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Testimony had been led regarding a .38 special bullet or projectile which had been found in the guardhouse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> What is your knowledge of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> It was news for me to hear about it here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And during the first trial, the joint trial where Mr de Meillon appeared, was there any reference to a .38 revolver bullet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> The attorney came to me with a little bag with a bullet in it and he told me that the bullet was from my firearm.  I pointed out to him that it was a bullet from a 9 mm pistol not from a .38.  Mr de Meillon's attorney from Bloemfontein was also present.  They took a lunch break and after that Mr de Meillon pleaded guilty and the two trials were divided in separate trials.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> During your own trial in Springs were any allegations made that firstly you had shot and killed Mr Terblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Were there any allegations that you had fired a shot in the guardroom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Mr Holder if you have to look at the matter objectively, how do you feel about that action on the 23rd April 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well if I think back now, I feel that it is something that I will have to carry with me for the rest of my life, this feeling of self-loathing and I can't measure that against the heartache of the parents of the deceased and his family and never again would I like to become involved in something like this again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Would you say that these events of the 23rd April took place according to plan or would you say that unforeseen things had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I would say it was totally unforeseen what had happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And as far as Mr de Meillon is concerned, what are your present impressions regarding him as a person and his judgement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Then I think he was fanatical, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> But on the night of the action did you at that stage, were you in a position to form this impression?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well I think after that I thought he was really a bit off his rocker and that he had acted impulsively Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Did you at any stage meet Mr Terblanche's parents or family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Mr Chair, they were just in court the day Mr de Meillon pleaded guilty, it was the only time that I saw them and when we adjourned and after lunch when the judge separated the two trials, we returned home and they remained behind in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> As far as the crime itself is concerned, do you accept that you were party to the murder and the robbery with aggravating circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes I accept the court's finding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> How do you feel about the crimes you had been involved in and committed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well I'm very sorry that I had participated in something which had led to the tragic death of such a young man and I can only express my sorrow and the fact that I feel remorse towards his family and his parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> As far as your right-wing affiliations are concerned, are you still a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I have given up all my ties with the AWB and all other right-wing organisations shortly after this event.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> As you had stated you are a qualified electro-technician?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Were any indications given to you regarding work that would wait for you were you to be granted amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Could you give us more particulars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well many of the rental contractors could provide me with work at any time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Should amnesty be granted, do you plan to become involved in crime at all in future?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KOTZE</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Kotze.  Mr Prinsloo any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Holder, 1993 October, were you already a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Mr Chair, December I became a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you aware of meeting held by the AWB in Klerksdorp where there were big congregations of people, where many people met inter alia leaders of the AWB and stated ultimatums to the Government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes I'm aware of many meetings arranged by the AWB before I joined.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Are you aware of the meeting at the Trim Park in Potchefstroom in April 1994, beginning of April where war talk was made and where people were called upon and where a Volkstaat's borders would be sketched out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I saw that on television Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Are you also aware of a variety of bomb explosions which preceded the elections?  I'm not referring to Johannesburg, explosions to the Sunday onwards to election day but before that time in the Free State in the Western Transvaal, are you aware of those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No I haven't heard of those.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you didn't but you are aware of the fact that the AWB had propagated country wide to oppose the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes I'm aware of that Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And country wide, people would be protected and a Volkstaat and a Volkstaat would be formed and then violence would be committed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You testified that with regard to illegal firearms, that's the word that you used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Now where would you have fetched illegal firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I was given to understand by Mr Schalkwyk that people had firearms that were not registered in their name which were illegal as the word indicates, that they would be using during the time that the civil war would break out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Those arms would then be taken physically from these people who were in illegal possession of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Would that take place in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In Vermeulen Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is what Mr de Meillon pointed out to us at this building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But these illegal weapons that was referred to was in the words of Mr van Schalkwyk, he had told you about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes, Mr van Schalkwyk said we were under the command of Mr de Meillon, they had observed the whole matter and they had investigated it fully.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just to get clarity Mr Holder, it is your testimony that Mr van Schalkwyk was as a matter of fact the commander and he told you, which had nothing to do with Mr de Meillon, that you would have to confiscate or take over by violent means firearms in illegal possession of people, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you are not attributing it to Mr de Meillon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> We were under his instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, no you don't understand the question clearly, this is what Mr van Schalkwyk told you, not Mr de Meillon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Mr de Meillon hadn't stated anything to me, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Good, according to your statement in paragraph 15 you furthermore state and that's on page 24 that he had reconnoitred the set up and knew where automatic arms could be obtained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you were satisfied on that day you were just going to collect the firearms whether by violent means or not and that the necessary reconnoitring had already been done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> May I come in, excuse me Mr Prinsloo, can I again ascertain, when Mr van Schalkwyk said these things through that there were weapons to be found at Vermeulen Street, these were illegal weapons, this was in the presence of Mr de Meillon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> This whole conversation he heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But he said nothing at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, Mr de Meillon didn't participate in that discussion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And all the way to Pretoria he did not say to you what Van Schalkwyk said is not the position, he didn't contradict Van Schalkwyk at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No he didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Holder, just to further investigate this question which the Honourable Advocate Gcabashe had raised, is it now your testimony that Mr van Schalkwyk had said that the firearms were to be obtained in Vermeulen Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, Mr van Schalkwyk had said that Mr de Meillon had observed various places where we could obtain firearms, we had to go with Mr de Meillon and then thus in that manner find or get the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So Mr van Schalkwyk hadn't said to you that they were in Vermeulen Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, Mr De Meillon took us there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, the question is, Mr van Schalkwyk never mentioned a specific place where the arms could be found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No he didn't Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you answered very quickly and said Mr de Meillon had heard everything, are you saying this out of conviction or did Mr van Schalkwyk who was a member of the AWB or Mr de Meillon who was not enter into a discussion there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No I say that with conviction Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well Mr de Meillon will deny that it had ever been said to him that firearms would be collected in Vermeulen Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Mr de Meillon said there were firearms in Pretoria and when we went there he said it was in Vermeulen Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But that was only raised when you were travelling there, not what Mr van Schalkwyk had said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Mr van Schalkwyk just said Mr de Meillon had observed a variety of places where we could find firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You also replied to a question of the Honourable Advocate Gcabashe that it was semi-automatic weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you know what a semi-automatic weapon is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I had used the wrong term, it was automatic weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And those automatic weapons which you would go and collect there, you would take by violent means if necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> According to what they had told me, Mr van Schalkwyk in the presence of Mr de Meillon, these guards were normally drunk or these people who were in possession of these firearms and it would therefore be reasonably easy to take these weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you were given to understand that they would be in possession of these people, that you would take it from their person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, I thought it was a place, a stand, a house where people lived and where these firearms were on those premises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But there would be people who would be guarding them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes there would be people present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And they would be armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> He didn't tell us that they would be armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you in the defence force Mr Holder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you know of any place where arms weren't protected by armed guards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> In my opinion, I wouldn't protect firearms that I had illegally hidden away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Now where did you expect illegal arms to be found in Vermeulen Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well as I'd stated, I don't know Pretoria.  We travelled to Pretoria, when we entered Pretoria, Mr de Meillon said we must drive up Vermeulen Street and he pointed out this building to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> As I understand your testimony, you stated that Mr de Meillon had said that the arms had to be taken away from the guards and that this would have propaganda value for the BWB or the right-wing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So by some or other means the guards would be robbed of the firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So it was his testimony that it would be taken from these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So his testimony was never that they would remove firearms from a safe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you have any equipment to remove firearms from a safe, like an ...(indistinct) torch or anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you knew that it would be taken from persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No I didn't, I thought it was a place where firearms were hidden away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And if those people were to resist, you had a firearm to defend yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Or to carry out the plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I would have defended myself had I been attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you would also be able to carry your planning to effect by using that firearm to obtain those weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well if it had been my purpose to cold-bloodedly attack people would I have done that at the building in Vermeulen Street which Mr de Meillon wished to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's not the question, if the person were to resist or would refuse to hand over his weapon, would you use violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, Mr Chair, I wouldn't try to take a firearm from any person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> When you arrived in Devon with Mr de Meillon, you went with Mr de Meillon, you got over the fence to the place where the act was committed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And when you entered that place did you see if there were people inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What did you think then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> At that stage I didn't think anything.  I thought nothing of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What do you mean you didn't think about it, you had a balaclava over your head and so did Mr de Meillon, you were both armed, you walked into a place which you know as a military institution, you walk into the place where the guards are sitting, what did you think was going to happen now?  Why were you entering there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well I knew there were problems awaiting but after I had seen what had happened in Pretoria I tried to convince myself of a way to stop this whole thing but it was too late when we entered there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So your testimony is that according to Van Schalkwyk, De Meillon had already done reconnoitring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So when he went in there was no reason for any reconnoitring because that had already been done according to your own testimony?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well Mr de Meillon told me and Mr van Zyl that we were just going to see what was going on there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But your testimony was that reconnoitring had already been done, that's your testimony?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And now he enters a place where there are guards sitting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So I propose to you that Mr de Meillon's version means that guards would be robbed of firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is not what we were doing in Devon, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But you testified and I wish to state to you that Mr de Meillon was a person who had been trained in Devon, so he would certainly know where the arms safe would be, it wasn't necessary to go and search for arms because he would know where the were.  Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes, that's what he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So there was no reason for any reconnoitring in that regard.  So when he entered that room where the guards were sitting, with reference to what he had said in Pretoria that the guards would be robbed of their firearms, did you assume that would happen there in Devon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes when we went in there I assumed that is what would happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What were you trying to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I thought that perhaps I would stop the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What were you going to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well perhaps to stop Mr de Meillon possibly just be guilty of attempted robbery rather than a murder or something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So did you do anything to stop Mr de Meillon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, when I went in it was already going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He said to them that they shouldn't be Rambos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He said to them they shouldn't be stupid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes, he said to them they shouldn't commit stupid things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> He and Mr Terblanche, one of the constables, were in a struggle, I moved behind them towards Mr Swart.  Mr Swart was pulling his firearm and I grabbed him by the arm and by the shoulder.  A shot went off, I pushed Mr Swart away and I ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you walk past De Meillon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at that stage was there no struggle between De Meillon and the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No when I went passed Mr de Meillon, Mr Terblanche jumped up and they got involved in a struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> After you had passed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, while I was passing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you were on your way to Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why were you walking towards Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I saw him drawing his pistol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What did you want to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I wanted to stop him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Stop him from doing what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> From shooting me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But why would he shoot you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Because we came into a place where we were not supposed to be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But had you done something that would justify his shooting you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well I was wearing a balaclava and brown clothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> When you entered with the brown clothing and the balaclava did you foresee that this plan which De Meillon had would be carried into effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I just foresaw that there were big problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you foresee his carrying his planning to effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes I did foresee that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You then went to Swart.  Your concentration was on Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you don't know what was happening behind you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you said that you then heard a shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You don't know who fired the shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was the light still on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> During the struggle the light went out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did the shot go off before or after the lights went out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Just after the light went out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> After the light went out the shot went off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I can't remember correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you can't say from where the shot came?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> As I said I don't know who fired it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Your co-applicant says that there were three shots and Mr de Meillon says this as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I heard one shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you argue that there could have been three shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> It could have been so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And according to a ballistics report which was submitted to the Committee, a police report, it says that a .38 shell was found.  Would you argue that anything like this was found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Because when I appeared in court the day that my and Mr de Meillon's cases were divided, the officer came with a bag with the bullet points and he said that it came from my firearm and it's impossible because it's too small.  They ask that the court adjourn for lunch, after the lunch break we returned.  Mr de Meillon pleaded guilty for murder and robbery, the case was divided.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And a .38 round is smaller than a 9 mm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, I said a 9 mm. was smaller than a .38.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you said that this was a flattened bullet point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No it was a small sharp point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you therefore argue that which the ballistic expert said in the police report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> As I've said in court they didn't show me a .38 point, they showed me a 9 mm point and said that this was the bullet which I had fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> If you look at the bullet point of a .38 and compare it with a 9 mm you will see that they are the same size?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No they are not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So the prosecutor was the one that came to you, not the legal representative?  He showed you a bullet point and said that this comes from your weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That's what he did.  My advocate and Mr de Meillon's advocate were standing there with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And according to Mr de Meillon's evidence he said that he had a 9 mm and that the deceased had a 9 mm as well as Mr Swart and that you had a .38?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So if a .38 had been found there it would only have been yours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> If a .38 had actually been found there it would have been mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So what did you want to go and see in this guardhouse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I was under command of Mr de Meillon, I assumed that we would go and see how many guards there were and whether they were there or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And if they were there or if they weren't there, what would happen then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well according to my knowledge of military bases there are always guards and one can never be sure of how many there are at a given time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So there are always guards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So whether it's that day or the next day, it would be exactly the same?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> How old were you at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I was 36 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Mr de Meillon had just turned 21?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And your co-applicant is also older than Mr de Meillon?  He's closer to your age?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you didn't belong to the same organisation so you couldn't have fallen under his command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> As I have already said sometimes the AWB and the BWB had to co-operate and I'm assuming that the person with the highest rank would then take up command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You've stated that you'd met Mr de Meillon on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, I stated that I'd met him two weeks earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I beg your pardon, did you just meet him fleetingly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No we attended a meeting at Mr van Schalkwyk's house at which Mr de Meillon was also present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did he act normally that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> On that particular day in Pretoria did he behave normally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes until we reached Pretoria and Devon he did and then in Pretoria he said he wanted to take the weapons from the guards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, so why do you say that that's fanatical?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I didn't say that, I said that afterwards I realised that the man was fanatical.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But upon what do you base your definition of him as fanatical?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well with regard to the evidence that's he's just delivered during which he said that he was disappointed in the fact that that which was planned for that day had not worked and from that I could see he was fanatical.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So what you're saying is that at stage you believed in a war, you believed in the protection of Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, I didn't say that I believed in a war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you didn't believe in violence at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I didn't say that either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You wouldn't have used violence at any time, so what did you need the weapons for, could you please tell the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> We created safe houses in which we would protect our women and children and that is what we needed the weapons for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you would not have reconciled yourself with the idea of a Volkstaat, obtaining a Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I reconciled myself with the obtaining of a Volkstaat but not with violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No further questions, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRINSLOO</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Prinsloo.  Mr van Schalkwyk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Mr Holder, did you ever consider lodging an appeal against your sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes I did consider this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did you proceed with your appeal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> My former legal representative dissuaded me from continuing with the appeal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did you agree with the judgement of the judge in the case in which you were found guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes I identified myself with the judgment of the court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Do you agree with the judgement of the court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes I agree with the court that I was involved in the death of Mr Terblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did you read the judgement of the court, did you read it personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Mr Kotze read the judgement to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Do you agree with the judges judgement as put out in the essential facts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well I can't remember all the facts right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Are there specific facts which the judge found with which you did not agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> If you could read these facts to me I could listen to it once more and then inform you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> We will come to that shortly.  Did you fill in form 1 of your amnesty application yourself?  I'm referring to page 16, 17 and 18.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did you initial the page in order to indicate your agreement with what is contained thereon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Paragraph 8(b), why didn't you fill in that you had undergone military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> We filled in this application form together, Mr Kotze and myself and we did not answer all the questions here, we provided answers to this on other pages and documents which we formulated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> But I asked you whether or not you just filled this form in yourself, why didn't you indicate you military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> With the rest of my application I did indicate my military training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Is it correct that you made an additional statement, page 43, 44, 45 of this application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> On which date was the second supplementary affidavit made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> On which date did you make this second supplementary affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> The 6th June 1998.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Your legal representative has during the process made certain amendments with regard to a certain paragraph.  Why were these amendments not made during your supplementary affidavit when you had the opportunity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Because I did not have the entire amnesty application with me, only this portion of it was faxed to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>My wife brought it to me and I took the oath at prison and it was sent back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I put it to you that the changes brought about by your legal representative on behalf of you are facts which would have been known to you before you made these changes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I saw this on Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I also put it to you that these amendments were made in order to adjust to the other applications of the other applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> You have just testified that you did not have all the documents at your disposal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> So what you are trying to tell us is that you made these amendments based upon the fact that you had perused all the documents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, we saw that it was not correct on Monday when we consulted with Mr Kotze.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> So what you're actually telling us is that when you made the first affidavit there was an oversight according to which you did not see that there were certain errors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> My amnesty application was handled by attorneys,  Mr Grobbelaar who handled my case in court.  During 1996 when Mr Nelson Mandela announced the extension of the cut-off date set up this application a few days before the cut off date,  a few days before the cut off date for amnesty applications my wife approached Mr Kotze, to undertake this thing with which Mr Grobbelaar had not done anything at that stage.  So, this was compiled during a very brief time, it was typed and Mr Kotze's secretary brought the document, we perused it and initialled it and that Friday afternoon it was placed on an aeroplane to Cape Town so that it could reach Cape Town before the cut off date on that Saturday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I refer you to paragraph 17, an amendment was brought about there from army bases to army headquarters and this was initialled by yourself and the Commissioner of Oaths?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> What page is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Page 25, paragraph 17.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> So you rectified this one error.  Why didn't you rectify the other errors at this stage in the same fashion that you had rectified this particular error?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well I didn't notice it on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Is it correct for us to say that you perused the paragraphs, saw this one error but did not pick up the incorrect set up of the essential facts pertaining to this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> But is it not these facts which formed the basis of your application which are of cardinal importance to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Do you realise that this was taken before a Commissioner of Oaths?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Do you further confirm that the second affidavit is also a proper affidavit which was taken in front of a Commissioner of Oaths?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Sir I put it to you that your cardinal evidence was changed at a very later stage, why did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> As I've already told you I did not notice it, I did not notice it that day that I initialled the documents.  You must realise that these things were undertaken on the 9th and applications closed on the 10th and my nerves were not in their best state on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Sir, would you regard the first applicant, Mr de Meillon, as a confidante or a friend of yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Would you regard the first applicant, Mr de Meillon, as a confidante or a friend of yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I would describe him as an acquaintance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> So you wouldn't really describe him as a friend of yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No I wouldn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> You heard Mr de Meillon's evidence.  Do you believe that he has been open and honest regarding everything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No I don't believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> In which regard has he not been open and honest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I think he is trying to protect certain people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> With regard to the events according to which he said that you were in the building with a firearm, do you differ from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> In which regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I did not have a firearm in my hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Where was your firearm according to you when you entered the building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> In the side pocket of my brown trousers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Can you explain then why Mr de Meillon would present a lie to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I can't explain that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> When you looked through the window did you see that there were SAP members in the building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I saw that there were white people inside the building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> At that stage did you see the uniforms of these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I saw the uniforms when I entered the room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Do you think it is justified to shoot a policeman dead for the sake of his 9 mm pistol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No I don't think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Do you think that any political organisation could account for itself by saying that it is justified to shoot one policeman in order to gain one 9 mm firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did Mr de Meillon at any stage when he was with you give an indication that he did not undertake reconnaissance of this base before the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No he did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Emanating from the discussion where you, Van Schalkwyk an De Meillon were present would you say that he would have said so if he had not undertaken reconnaissance of the area at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I must lodge an objection here, he cannot ask the applicant what a reasonable person would have done in that situation, it is a speculative question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Let me rephrase my question.  If you had been Mr de Meillon at that stage and he testified today that since his military service he had never again entered that base would you have made it known to any other person that during that time you had never been there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> If he had informed me of this I would not have gone with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did Mr de Meillon have the opportunity to disclose that he had not undertaken reconnaissance shortly before this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I think that he had the opportunity, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> In as far as you were concerned were you ever aware or under the impression that you would be stealing personal weapons from people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> You've said that you want forgiveness for the incident, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> How have you expressed this forgiveness or indicated this forgiveness to the family of the person who was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I have had no contact with the family of the person who was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> But if somebody says that they are sorry you could have sent them a card, a gift, flowers or something similar during the funeral, but you didn't do anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I put it to you that if in fact you had shown real remorse you would have approached the family some or other way and indicated your remorse through this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I can only say that if someone - if I had been in the same position, if someone had killed one of my family members I'm sure if I would be able to forgive them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Sir were you ever in a position where you could have testified against some of your co-accused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Were you ever approached by Inspector Nel to testify against Mr de Meillon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did you ever offer to testify against him in the court case in the criminal court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> If you ever had remorse about a situation which you wish to defuse yourself, why didn't you go and testify against the person who had committed the murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Nobody had asked me to testify against him so I assumed that there was adequate evidence against each and every one of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> But you were in a position where you could have testified against him or could have offered to testify?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Mr de Meillon pleaded guilty to the charge so it wasn't necessary to testify against him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I state it to you that he had only pleaded guilty after Constable Swart had testified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Constable Swart's testimony had been led.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Could we therefore deduce that he had first looked whether or wanted to see whether there was enough evidence against him before he turned around and pleaded guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I wouldn't know Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Sir, a person who feels remorse and who wishes to plead guilty does so from the beginning, he doesn't wait until the State had called for the chief witness and the chief witness's testimony had been accepted by the court and then turn around and then plead not guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Well I think this is a legal argument about how people who feel remorse would have acted and Mr Holder, who clearly doesn't have knowledge of legal processes and to ask him about why Mr de Meillon and his legal team had acted in a certain way I think is unreasonable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I will leave it at that, I will not take it any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>	You yourself did not plead guilty initially?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> At which stage did you plead guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> During my court case I did not plead guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> And ultimately you were found guilty, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> As a person who is telling us that you are remorseful why didn't you plead guilty from the beginning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Upon the advice from my legal team I pleaded not guilty.  I felt that I myself did not pull the trigger that killed the victim.  As an accomplice I would have pleaded guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> What sort of vehicle did you use to travel to Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I did not use my vehicle, Mr van Zyl used his vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> What sort of vehicle was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> It was a three litre Ford.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I put it to you that it is improbable that you would have had enough time to travel to Pretoria and back in the time available to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> We were in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> This action beforehand where you had done exercises in the protection of vehicles which you have given evidence about, was that undertaken in order to attack vehicles as well or only to protect vehicle convoys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Only for the protection of vehicle convoys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did you undergo any training in the period prior to the incident in attacking places or arsenals or the disarming of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Was your training strictly defensive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Are you going to call Mr van Zyl to testify on your behalf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> He has been informed that his name will not be mentioned and he is not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did you have any other evidence with regard to your participation in right-wing politics, any information which can prove this participation and involvement in right-wing politics other than your attendance of meetings of these organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I believed that there are people who will testify that I was indeed a member of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I put it to you that all of those who were present at these meetings were necessarily AWB members and did not necessarily share the sentiments of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, as I've already said the first part of the meeting would be an open meeting and after that it would be a closed meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I'm taking you to page 59, the list of supplies which you had to keep ready in the event of a war.  I put it to you that page 57 and 58 form a unit and that page 59 is a separate report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, if I peruse it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> And I put it to you that it is highly improbable that a town council would issue a report such as that which appears on page 59 and place it in people's post boxes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> These were all found in our post boxes which were all at a central location, that is where we obtained it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> So what you're saying is that - can you say with certainty whether these guidelines were distributed by the town council, both sets?  Is it only page 59 or page 57?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I wouldn't be able to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> So in effect you're saying that these guidelines could have been distributed by somebody else or somebody else with access to the town council or the post office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> It must have been someone from the post office or the town council, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> The person whom you married, are those your own children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> You were married during this process, the person whom you married, did you marry this person before or after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No I was married before the incident and these children are my own children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Thank you.  I would just like to take you to Constable Swart's statement.  Do you know about his statement which he made in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes I do know about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> You agree with his evidence which he gave during the court proceedings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> In what regard would you say that his evidence is incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I can't remember his statement explicitly because it was made two years ago and there are certain aspects of that statement with which I do not agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I put it to you that he will make a statement during which he said that the words were never uttered that you were acting on behalf of a right-wing organisation.  What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I said so just now, Mr de Meillon said "don't do anything stupid".  I didn't hear him say that he was from a right-wing organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Constable Swart goes further to say in his statement that it was never put to him or said to him that weapons would be taken from any person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> In both these statements is Mr de Meillon incorrect in saying that this happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I wouldn't know I was not with him in the room at that moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I put it to you that it was a very small room and that you stood at the open door and if this had been said you would have heard it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No, as I have already testified, I stood by the window when I saw Mr de Meillon go in and upon that I followed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I would just like to pick that up, the political deed, do you have any evidence that the political organisation you allege you belonged to had given approval for the killing of policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No I don't have, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Do you feel that is justified to kill a policeman for one firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No it isn't justified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> In which respect could this deed have contributed to any political purpose or objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> It couldn't have contributed, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN SCHALKWYK</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Advocate Steenkamp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> No questions thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> No questions thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Mr Holder, there is one aspect I'd like to clarify with you.  You talked about the request or a request being equated to an instruction, you equated requests with instructions if they came from a commander, is that what you're saying?  Am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But did you consider Mr de Meillon to be your commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> During the evening of the event, yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Now I know that the detail of where you were going to or the broad terms rather, where you were going to you got from Mr van Schalkwyk.  I'm trying to find out who gave you the instruction, was it Mr de Meillon, Mr van Schalkwyk or if there were two instructions, just clarify that for me because both of them seemed to have had an influence on what you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I was given the instruction by Mr van Schalkwyk, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Could you have refused to go with Mr de Meillon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I saw my involvement with the AWB as the same as the then defence force, in other words if a higher ranking officer gave an instruction you carried it out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And in this instance the high ranking officer was Mr van Schalkwyk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> There are actually a couple of more areas that I have notes on here.  Coming to the guardhouse you were at the window then you went to the door.  Did the struggle start when you were at the window, when you were at the door or when you had already walked into the room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> When I walked into the room the struggle started, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> That's the struggle between Mr de Meillon and the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You had walked in already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> I understood you to say that you walked into the room because you saw Mr Swart pull his firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Correct me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I walked into the room when I saw Mr de Meillon go in then I followed him into the room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Yes, at what point did you observe Mr Swart pulling his firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> As I entered the room the deceased jumped up and he and Mr de Meillon were struggling then I saw Mr de Swart pulling his firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You see again I'm trying to understand, when you walked into the room you were going in to separate De Meillon and Terblanche or whether you walked in because at that point you observed Mr Swart pull his firearm and that's where you were headed, I'm not too sure, just help me with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> His firearm wasn't pulled yet, he was busy pulling it when I came into the room and Mr - the deceased jumped up and struggled with Mr de Meillon then I went to ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You went straight to Mr Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And then finally, I have to come back to where you were supposed to find these arms, again it's a note that I had made.  When you were told about these arms that Mr de Meillon knew about, that were in various places, were you told that they were from the Government, they were Government arms, were you told that there was a camp where certain people were and I had assumed and I read the documents that it would either be the ANC or the SACP where they had these illegal arms?  Whose arms were you going to take in terms of structures, political structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I believed at that stage that these firearms were PAC or SACP or ANC or any one of those groups.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And the premises that you were headed for as far as you knew was a camp where these particular people were holding these illegal arms as far as you were concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, or a house or a location or something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> It had nothing to do with the government of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Or any declaration of war against the government of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Kotze any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR KOTZE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>	And when you had taken these weapons do you still say that these weapons would then be used for protection of the safe houses with the people you have already mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> And did you believe at that stage that it was a political and military order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Mr Holder, you had been questioned regarding the finding of the judge as to where you agree and you don't agree.  Part of his finding was that you and Mr van Zyl and Mr de Meillon on that particular evening didn't go to Pretoria at all.  What is your attitude about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I still agree with the finding of the Judge, but we were in Pretoria, I know we were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Then it was also found that Mr Swart could have seen your blue eyes through a vest, what is your opinion about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Well I don't believe Mr Swart could have seen my eyes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> You were also cross-questioned or questioned regarding Mr Swart's evidence during the trial and your comment was that there were certain aspects with which you didn't agree, a matter with regard to where your firearm was.  Do you think Mr Swart would have been in a position to make an observation in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I don't know whether he could have made this observation because he was busy drawing his firearm, he was wasn't really looking at what was going on at the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> You also remarked just now that this couldn't contribute to a political objective, if we now look at the isolated incident of the 23rd April, that sort of senseless killing of a police officer, is that what you're referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> But the broader idea of trying to obtain firearms, do you believe that that could have a political influence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> Yes that is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KOTZE</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Kotze.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I have one brief question if the Chairman will allow me to reply?  On page 66 the judge says in his finding with regard to Swart the policeman, that he was an honest and impressive witness, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLDER:</span> I agree with what the judge had found.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Is there any reason why you could believe that he was not an impressive and honest witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> I have to object against this question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes I think it is a well founded objection, he has replied to your question Mr van Schalkwyk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Yes I'm satisfied that he has replied, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN SCHALKWYK</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see we've almost reached the end of the day.  You have one client whose case you have to offer, I don't know whether you have any further testimony or evidence in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Mr Chairman, no further evidence on behalf of Mr Holder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you conclude his application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOTZE:</span> Yes I do conclude his application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think under those circumstances, time has caught up with us at any rate and we therefore will have the matter stand over.  We'll adjourn this application until tomorrow and we will reconvene at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.  So we are adjourned.</p>
