<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> 15 December 1993?  What happened on the 15th of December 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> There were six of us.  We left from Blah's place, headed for the Kliprivier police station.  We went there with the intention of armed robbery.  Four of us remained outside when we got there.  Only myself and one other deceased person went inside.  There were two police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many went in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> There were only two of us who went inside.  We found two policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who are the two that went in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It was myself and Themba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Themba who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Sibeko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Then who are the four who remained outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It was Mduduzi, Kage and Molefe as well as Serge Mokozi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Then Themba Sibeko and yourself got in to this police station, then the four others remained outside.  What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> We found two policemen, black policemen.  I said to them we are asking for help.  They wanted to know what kind of help we wanted and I told them that we have a breakdown, a motor vehicle breakdown and when they wanted to know where, I drew my firearm and pointed it at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>	Themba too had a firearm.  We then instructed them to lay on the floor.  After that, we took the firearms that they had.  We took the firearms that they had in their possession.  Mduduzi, Molefe and the other one came in.  We wanted to know where the other firearms were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>	We wanted to know from these policemen where the other firearms were because we only found three firearms from them, two pistols as well as an R5.  They became stubborn.  We tried to scare them, beating them up and promised them death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>	They then told us that the firearms, the other firearms are in the safe.  We demanded the keys to the safe.  They gave us the keys.   They showed us the key, we ordered one of them to stand up and that was the one who was led to the safe to open it himself.  Indeed, we found the firearms there in the safe.  We found palm guns, six of them.  Six palm guns, three R1's, four pistols.  We then tore a wire, we then disconnected the telephone wire.  We then left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What happened to the policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> We left them there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you tie them up or ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, we did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Who commanded this operation sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Mduduzi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Why did you specifically target this Kliprivier police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It was an easy target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It was an easy target, it did not have many policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Were you all armed on that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> If you were armed and your intention was to go and rob these arms and ammunitions, did you foresee that the police officers who were at that police station, would if resisting, would get hurt or would eventually die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, we did think about that but then we were also armed.  We wanted these firearms from the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you do what was necessary to obtain those firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Do you what ultimately happened to the arms and ammunition that you robbed that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> We used these firearms for the protection of the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you left the police station with all these firearms, what did you do with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> We gave these firearms to Blah and he in turn gave it to our soldiers, gave these firearms to our soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> The arms that were distributed by Blah, that is the arms that you robbed at the police station, will you agree with me that they were also used in all these violent activities that occurred during the period 1993 to the end of the violence in mid-1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And you associate yourself with the results that came about as a result of those arms, that is the murders and the injuries that were caused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you associate yourself with the crimes committed in the process of stealing those firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> If you were to know the identity of the police officers that you assaulted, threatened when you robbed these arms, would you take that opportunity and try to express your words of regret, that you are sorry for what you did on that particular evening, on that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I would apologise to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, through the evidence it transpired that a telephone wire was cut and as a result, it constitutes malicious damage to property.  I would request that it be added as a further application in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... telephone wires, as I understand your evidence, it was part and parcel of this whole action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that is correct.  We wanted to be safe until we were out of the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I don't have any further questions.</p>
