He was a teacher, and his presence there helped a lot and there were other areas then like Diepkloof and Orlando West and these were predominantly ...[indistinct] and there were areas that we shared, like Dlamini 1 and Dlamini 2.  They were Black Consciousness Movement and others were UDF.\n\tNow after this tension has reached Soweto it was quite difficult for one to leave his own area to go to another.  I would not leave my area and go to Diepkloof.  Yes, I would do that under certain circumstances, wearing just private clothes, not any organisation's clothes.\n\tNow there was a problem in Dlamini.  There were fights and comrade George Oukop's house was attacked.  He was the Secretary General at that time.
