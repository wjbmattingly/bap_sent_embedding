<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Steenkamp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, no questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Mr Kubeka, in your application form you talk of general defensive actions and I assumed that this particular one you have just dealt with one of many, are you going to supplement as the Commander of a particular area, are you going to be supplementing your current application at all, you know vis-a-vis the other things that you may have done.  Your name has come up quite a few times and I don't know if you know the detail of those particular applications, and whether you are intending in this general application of yours, to mention those incidents as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBEKA:</span> What I can say something that may not be part of this form, is that I was a Commander of the soldiers.  We were at a battle field.  If one were a Commander, there is, I can say there is nothing specific that I can refer to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you aware of any details of other incidents which you may have ordered some of your soldiers to commit?  Can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBEKA:</span> No.  I cannot remember.  It has been a long time now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I accept that.  You see, I just want to point out to you that there are other applicants who testified here about incidents that they had committed and they have also said that you were the Commander of that Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>	They may not have said that there was a plan or a meeting in which you were present, where they decided to do certain things, so I am not too sure, whether you were involved in such incidents or not.  I thought it best to raise it with you, just in case you - you've got an opportunity now to apply for those.  If you were not involved, then so be it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>	I don't know if your Attorney wants a few minutes to check with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I would appreciate that very much Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>Mr Chairman, I have consulted my client and my instructions are that as far as he knows, there are no other incidents where he issued out commands, except for this one.  He remembers this one very well.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> No questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Kubeka, you seem to have been a respected leader in a small way there in Tokoza.  What seems to be the situation there now as far as fighting and violence is concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBEKA:</span> The situation is very acceptable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there any chance of a repeat of this, there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBEKA:</span> No, that will never occur ever, because the situation is under a watchful eye now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the lessons that had been learnt from them, are they such that one can avoid a repetition of this problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBEKA:</span> Yes, they are our brothers.  We are living together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
